this is dr p chitramani, professor in business
distributors, retailers, and consumers who are linked through
flow of products and services, information and funds to meet
the customer needs or rather a dream a supply chain is a
collection of suppliers linked to create one specific product
or service for a company every product has its own supply chain
those certain suppliers are linked for multiple products
it is a chain or network of nodes or links,
which include multiple suppliers, manufacturers
and subcontractors, warehouses, distribution centers, and stores
where the consumer can purchase the products each link in the
cup of coffee you walk to the kitchen shelf, take the coffee
supply chain is sequenced in a specific direction and order
each link in supply chain adds time cost and customer service
it involves human interfaces, digital integration and
logistics partnership supply chains are complicated and when
managed well lead to competitive advantage to ensure effective
control over supplies, value chain and customer service,
the supply chain can be integrated either vertically
or horizontally or both benchmarking best practices
and following them leads to sustainable supply chains
so, with a hope that you all have understood the concept of supply
powder, sugar and milk from the refrigerator you switch on the
chain and now to trigger your thinking, i asked you these two
questions from your experience as a customer, they picked a
supply chain and name the brand you like and sketch the supply
chain for it awaiting for your answer
this is dr p chitramani signing off with a cup of coffee
until you moved to the next session on supply chain management
stove, set the water to boil and follow the process to make
coffee with a cup of coffee you wonder what it takes to get
a cup of coffee in the morning? then comes the supply chain
let us consider the raw materials for processing a cup of coffee
namely the cooking gas, utensil water, milk, sugar and coffee powder
moving backward as a customer you can identify the
primary supply chains that is needed to get a cup of coffee
cooking gas is got at your door friend from the gas agent,
administration, avinashilingam institute for home science and higher
who in turn gets it from the regional gas depos of oil corporations
utensil is got from the supermarkets that
procure from private label utensil makers, who depend on
foundries, steel and plastic suppliers for raw materials
water at home flows from the regional water tanks, which
store and supply water got from the city tanks, dams and various
water resources milk is got from the local kirana shop who
replenish daily stock from milk processing units, who get milk
from the societies and dairy farmers sugars journey to your
cup starts from the sugarcane farmers to the sugarcane
education for women, presenting to you a course in supply chain management
procurement societies through the sugarcane factories and the
public distribution systems coffee powder is got from your
local retailer who gets coffee beans from the coffee booths, rose
the beans and powder it the coffee board intern by the
coffee beans from the local coffee plantations of farmers
in short, supply chain is a process that satisfies a
customer need and consists of multiple entities that are
linked through flow of products, information and funds
transferring the experience of coffee at home to the world
class starbucks coffee, we can understand the supply chain in
dear learners, welcome you all to the first
business sense starbucks corporation with more than
twenty-four thousand stores in seventy countries starts the journey of customer
fulfillment with a cup of coffee across the world with its
hand picked coffee beans, and other merchandises source across the globe
the goal of starbucks supply chain is to reduce costs
and improve efficiency it follows a plan, source, make
deliver model of supply chain what is starbucks plan? in two thousand and eight
starbucks to meet the competition
planned and re engineered its supply chain
with three major objectives that is
lecture on supply chain management and this session
reorganize to centralize its fragmented supply chain, cut
costs and improved services, designed supply chains to meet
its future capabilities as a sustainable sourcing strategy,
starbucks worked directly with its nearly three hundred thousand coffee
growers who meet the starbucks coffee and farmers equity
standards and coffee sourcing guidelineses starbucks
interaction with the farmers ensured that coffee beans are of
the same quality and flavor this empowers the suppliers to
meet quality standards, ethical standards, like protecting
workers rights and human working conditions,
focuses on what is supply chain? the learning objective is to
sustainability through social responsibility
the handpicked coffee beans generally sourced from
latin america, africa and asia are
shipped in ocean containers to its six company owned coffee
roasting plants in usa and europe, referred to as greenhouses
the beans are roasted and packed in the coffee roasting plants
the company also relies on twenty-four co-manufactures
in united states, canada, europe, asia and latin
america one world, one logistics systems of starbucks reduce the
transportation and logistics cost and increased efficiency
provide a customer view of supply chain and to link it to
after the coffee bean is roasted and packed, it is transported to
regional distribution centers starbuck has five in usa, of
which three is owned by starbucks and two are third party
logistics companies two third party logistics companies in
europe and two third party logistics companies in asia
the regional distribution centers carry everything that the
starbucks stores need from furniture to cappuccino cups
the regional distribution centers supply directly to the
stores if it has a locational advantage if not, the stores
are supplied from third party central distributional centers
the organizational perspective what is supply chain? supply
starbucks uses thirty-three third party central distribution centers in
usa, seven in asia's pacific region and three in europe and all
are well connected to the regional distribution centers
their effective communication and storecard assessment ensure
consistency, on time delivery, reducing end to end supply costs
and enhanced enterprise efficiency further, starbucks is
vertically integrated to provide the customer delight
starbucks is integrated backward through purchase agreements with coffee
growers, company owned bean roasting plants, company owned
warehousing and distribution facilities and company owned
chain is a flow of raw materials and processes that fulfills a customer need
coffee bean farms in costa rica & china
starbucks is integrated for work with its coffee shops selling
food and drinks, coffee beans, appliances and accessories
the holistic supply chain model of starbucks depict that the success of
starbucks infact is its definition and redefinition of
its supply chain to meet global challenges so, student, friends
with the hope that you all have understood the concept of supply
chain, let me sum up what is supply chain a supply chain is
a global network of raw material and merchandise
suppliers, manufacturers, logistics partners,
imagine you get up in the morning and look for a
integrated supply chain management processes and practices
its backward integration with dairy farmers who are members
and the village cooperative societies who function as collective centers
its forward integration to meet customers
is through amul utterly delicious parlors and franchisees,
and amul cyber stores what are some of the lessons learned
from amul integrated supply chain management process?
lessons learnt by it: geographic proximity of supplies provide
competitive advantage, provides simple automated procurement
services to reduce the procurement time,
develop a long term relationship with the suppliers, provide support
retailers and customers with this understanding,
systems to suppliers for improving productivity,
and to meet quality standards, partnering and revenue sharing
with the suppliers to indicate your growth is also his growth
digital integration provides better suppliers service and
ensures quality assessment and speedy delivery by suppliers
make it and move it: strategic location of manufacturing
facilities that captures local manufacturing advantage
resources and internal logistics systems need to be designed to
suit the products and process type outsourcing decisions for
supply chain processes and supporting processes determine
now let us move on to understand what is integrated supply chain management?
the success of supply chain management digital integration
with enterprise resource planning, enhances supply chain
efficiency and responsiveness lessons learnt awantmove it and
sell it are storage, transportation and logistics
needs to be monitored effectively cost and lead time
in transportation is an important factor to be
considered in supply chain network of distributors need to
be maintained without conflict of interest digital integration
need to trigger customer analysis integrate demand
management with supply chains designed bussiness portals
the learning objective of this session is to provide
and cyber stores for responsive supply chains lesson learnt on
integrate it are vertical and horizontal integration is an
extended supply chain of any organization and we need to
design effective processes that ensures quality, speedy, delivery
and flexibility across the supply chain partners to sum up
integrated supply chain management is about linking five
functions namely buy it, make it, move it, sell and service it and
integrated and this is achieved by well designed and unique
supply chain processes namely customer analysis, supplier
partnership, inventory management, materials and lead
insights on integrated supply chain management with
time management, manufacturing and outsourcing, storage
logistics and transportation, selling and servicing
through perfectly designed downstream internal and upstream supply
chains that are vertically and horizontally integrated
effective supply chains are achieved by proper mapping of
all the functions and activities across the supply chain
and eliminating unnecessary processes and that is called
lean supply chain management creating a culture that respects
quality, speedy delivery and flexibility to meet the changing
demand among the team members and the extended supply chain
examples and to trigger your thinking to design simple
partners focusing on sustainable supply chains that is green
supply chain management an exercise to help your comprehend
and design an integrated supply chain management system
list the integrated supply chain management processes that can
create competitive advantage the cooking as agents supplying
cooking gas cylinders to your house is worried about the
spiraling distribution cost and diminishing profits he cannot
pass on the price fluctuations to the customers as he has to
distribute the cooking gas cylinders at the government traits
map this supply chain and give five suggestions to improve its
integrated supply chain management systems
efficiency at a reduced costs
thank you learners meet you in next when we get to discussions
or move on to the next lecture on
supply chain goals and strategies
on completion of the lesson, you will be able to identify the
processes and practices that can lead to effective supply chain
management and suggests measures to design and implement an
integrated supply chain management system
dear all i hope you enjoyed the learning experience
what is integrated supply chain management? integrated supply
chain management is about integrating the supply chain
process namely plan, source, make and deliver in the words of wpk
integrated supply chain management as a process of
linking the functions of buy it, make it, move it,
sell it and service it in short integrated supply chain
management is a process that links the plan, source, make,
deliver functions to provide efficent and responsive services to the customers
now, let us understand the process of
integrated supply chain management by understanding the
with a lecture on what is supply chain and got triggered to
supply chain of amul, the taste of india, amul, the taste
of india was launched in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-six by gujarat co-operative federation
and has created the white revolution in india and it
focuses on quality, value for money, availability and service to the customers
the supply chain management process of
amul can be explained as follows: by it dairy farmers in
villageres supply milk to village cooperative societies
and village cooperative societies transport the milk to
district unions milk is pasteurized in the district unions
and transported to state cooperative marketing federation factories
identify the supply chain that satisfied you as a customer
where dairy products are manufactured and branded
move it and marketed involved products are transport to various
wholesale and retail stores amul has an extended supply chain to
amul food factory, reverse logistics to return milk
and other damaged products to the dairy is effective in amul
let us map each of the processes the upstream supply
chain of amul list of farmers and village cooperatives societies
every farmer who supplies milk to amul is given
a plastic card for identification
farmers identification number is captured and transmitted to
and to identify your favorite brand and its supply chain to reach you
local pc, milk is weight and fat content measured
the amount due to the farmers is calculated based on the fat content
and the value of the milk is printed in the slip
and the farmers collect the payment
village cooperative societies in turn
provide cattle feed, veterinary services and rural health
schemes to ensure quality of milk and suppliable being
the process that amul from supplier identification to payment is
digitally integrated with automatic milk collection unit systems
amul has integrated geographic information system
and with a bit of moving across your memory lane on what is supply chain,
for tracking of milk at the village collection center
the dairy information and service chaos establishes a good
supplier relationship it provides information to the
farmers to improve cattle yield and connects them to procure
and to collaborate with dairy products and services suppliers
make it and move it the internal supply chain of make it
starts with the milk being received at district milk unions
with chilling plants and functions as follows: amuls
chillers are strategically located in proximity to the villages
delivery to the district unions is through insulated rail
let us move on to the next session on integrated
tankers and chilled trucks amul facilitates prompt
transportation to district facilities and further
dispatches it to customers or processing units and electronic
systems to track inventory, provide information for
replenishments schedules gujarat cooperative federation has
strategic tie up with ibm to implement sap prp on ibm technologies
this will digitally connect end to end
business processes and ensure effective supply chain performance
process three, move it and sell it downstream
supply chain or formal is as follows: processed milk and
supply chain management supply chain is how you plan, source, make
dairy products move from the dairy unions to gujarat
cooperative milk marketing federation limited owned
warehouses, orders are received by gcmmf amul has a three tier
downstream flow from manufacturing unit to company
depos from company depos to wholesale depos
and wholesale depos to retailers or amul utterly delicious
parlours and franchises amul markets its products through
its fifty-six sales offices, and a network of ten thousand dealers
and hundred thousand retailers logistic decisions for
distribution is controlled and transportation cost is borne by gcmmf
and deliver the product and services by linking suppliers, distributors,
it also monitors suppliers of milk
and distributors of finished goods and services
effective reverse logistics minimizes cost
amul has established a b two b and b two c portal
that links its supplier, partners, distributors
and customers and it le sells all its product through cybersource
process for integrated amul has a cooperative society
has integrated its supply chain effectively,
both vertically and horizontally
the basic advantage of formulas,
manufacturers, logistics partners,
supply chain goals and strategies
and competitive challenges in the above case, the success lies in
how successfully the supermarket and the local fruit stall
leverages the market condition the local fruit seller can
leverage on replenish to sale from local markets, less
inventory or logistics and storage cost,
forward integration to reduce wastage, compete on price rather than
product or service differentiation the supermarket
can leverage on economies of scale, bulk purchase and bulk
selling, improved customer service and customer value,
backward integration and outsourcing supply chain
supply chain models supply chain is a sequence of functions and
management decision is based on what should be the supply chain aim
at, efficiency, responsiveness or both supply chains oriented
towards efficiency, aim at low cost supply chain, high
utilization of assets, reduce lead time and wastage
the three types of supply chain models that are best suited
for end to end efficiency are efficient supply chain model,
the fast supply chain model, continuous supply chain model efficiency
oriented supply chain models are applicable when demand has
become more certain and supply is predictable margins are lower
under intense competition and prices influence consumer choice
activities involved in delivering a product or service
supply chains oriented towards responsiveness, on the other
hand aim at meeting, changing customer needs, shortening lead
time, respond to innovative products and variety seeking
customers, high service quality the two types of supply chain
models that are oriented towards responsiveness are agile
supply chain models and custom configured supply chain model
responsive models are suitable when demand is uncertain, firms
earn high margins when demand meet supply, product innovation,
variety and the availability attracts customers, cost is a
secondary consideration in short, the objectives of the
it is a complex network of organizations who supply partner
supply chain are to ensure continuity in production
and delivery of products to the customer
reduce cost and maximize asset utilization, provide better
value for the product by reducing costs and increasing
customer experience, respond quickly to market changes,
innovate new products and processes to meet customer
needs and improve quality of products and services
these objectives can be achieved by designing supply chains to be
efficient and responsive to the demand conditions
to conclude, the objectives of any supply chain are to optimize the seven rs
and collaborate to fulfill a customers need
that is providing the right customer the right product of
the right quantity at the right place in the right condition at
the right price and at the right time and maximizing the supply
chain surplus and balancing efficiency and effectiveness of supply chain
these objectives of supply chain help in decision
of which supply chain model to offer in a given market condition
and the two noteworthy points are strategic
choice of efficiency oriented supply chain model,
or responsive oriented supply chain models depend on the type of
industry, competition and customer choice to achieve strategic fit
this is also referred to as value chain consisting of three paths,
the supply chain model can be shifted from one
type to the other as the product moves through the product life cycle
and when the demand supply characteristics change points to ponder
three examples of a well known supply chain masters, namely
walmart, amazon, and telsa quoted from smart street in usa,
is presented for you as transcripts on reading the brief
on the supply chain innovations comment on the following: what is
the supply chain model that these firms have followed?
and how are they different? explain how they have balanced
efficiency and responsiveness of supply chain
namely upstream supply chain, manufacturing and operations
thank you learners and have a thoughtful day
and ponder on the goals and strategies of supply chain management
logistics, downstream supply chain outbound logistics
supply chain function determines the success and failure of an
organization as it is customer centric and directed towards
customer satisfaction what then should be the objectives of
dear learners on completion of the lessons on supply chain
supply chain and supply chain management? imagine you're
arriving home late and you want a quick dinner, you call a home
service and order your dinner the moment you place your order
the supply chain process starts and it ends when you receive the
order but the success of supply chain is achieved if you have
received the order as specified by you the food is tasty
and fresh and if it reached you within the time anticipated
and made you feel you have not paid more for the service
from the customer perspective and the organizational perspective,
the goal of supply chain is to optimize the seven rs namely
and integrated supply chain management, let us move on to
providing to the right customer, the right product, of the right
quantity, at the right place, in the right condition, at the right
time and at the right price and this is possible only through
integrated processes that ensure effective flow of products,
informations and funds from the organizational perspective
the goal of supply chain is to optimize the seven seven rs at the
least cost and minimum lead time
this is financially termed as supply chain surplus
the objective of every supply chain is to maximize
the overall value generated or supply chain surplus supply
understand the goals and strategies of supply chains
chain surplus is equal to customer value minus supply chain cost
customer value is the revenue generated from the customers
and the sources customer supply chain cost
involves cost of flow of product or service, information and funds
effective supply chains are achieved by managing supply
chain assets, products, information and fund flow to
maximize supply chain surplus the supply chain decisions focus
on responsive deliveries at the lowest cost and the supply chain
decision in connection with supply chain surplus should be
viewed from the customer perspective
this lesson focuses on comprehending the objectives of
explaining this with an example of two occasions
when a customer wants to buy a kg of apples
occasion one is he visits the supermarket
with his family and picks one kg of apple occasion two is,
he visits his friend in the hospital and buys a kilo of
apple from the juice shop near the hospital with little
differentiation in the quality of apple, what is the impact of
this on supply chain decisions? let us calculate the supply
chain surplus for a kg of apple in these two occasions
occasion one going with the family to the supermarket
supply chain, supply chain surplus and strategic selection of
on sunday and buying a kg of apple
as we have noted earlier supply chain surplus is
equal to customer value minus supply chain cost and what is it
for a kg of apple in a supermarket? the customer has
gone to the supermarket to spend some family time and at the same
time complete the task of replenishing his monthly stock
and hence, customer value is what a customer
is willing to pay for a product and his buying experience
customer value is equal to sum of customer value
for one kg of apple label on the apple, convenience, family time,
supply chain models the learning outcome of this lecture
luxury enjoyed and loyalty, store atmosphere and experience
let us assumed the customer value as rupees one hundred and fifty per kg
supply chain cost is equal to supply chain cost of
procurement, cost of three tier supply chain, transportation
cost, preservation and storage cost, inventory and other
resource cost, store expenses, wastage and reverse
logistics cost and taxation let us assume that it as one hundred and twenty per kg
the supply chain surplus is equal to one hundred and fifty minus one hundred and twenty
that is thirty rupees occasion two customer visiting his friend in the
hospital and buying a kg of apple at a local fruit stall near the hospital
is you will be able to identify the goals of supply chain of
what is the supply chain surplus for a kg of
apple in the local shop near the hospital? the customer has gone
to the hospital and now buys the apple based on the availability
and proximity to purchase and hence customer value is equal to
the sum a customer is willing to pay for the product and his
buying experience that is sum of customer value for one kg of
apple, quality, convenience, quick purchase and proximity
let us assume the customer value is rupees one hundred and twenty per kg supply
chain cost is the sum of cost of procurement at single tier
supply chain, short distance transportation cost,
various organizations and the related supply chain models you
replenishment cost and minimum reverse logistics let us assume
that to be rupees eighty per kg the supply chain surplus per kg is
equal to rupees one hundred and twenty minus rupees eighty that is rupees forty
comparing the supply chain surplus of supermarket and local fruit
stall the surplus is more with the local fruit stall
what does this mean? does it mean that the supply chain of the local food
stall is more competitive than the supermarkets? in the real sense
apart from the profits, the competitiveness of the
supply chain is determined by how effective and how responsive
the supply chain is to meet the customer requirement
will be able to set supply chain objectives and relate it to
music
changes to ensure demand driven supply chains supported by
stategic sourcing and supplier alliances
changes in legislation affect the availability and cost of
supplies and lead time responsive supply chains to
identify transactional and collaborative relationship with
the government bodies and associations lead to competitive advantage
supply chain management processes can be standardised
and digitalize to suit the regulatory processes
supply chains today is not only about interacting with raw material
and components suppliers but also networking for outsourcing
management to gain competitive advantage?
facilities and processes environmental consciousness
and social responsibilities should be inbuilt at all points of the
supply chain through lean and green supply chain practices
dear learners to conclude we need to understand that
industries today function in dynamic business environments
and firms who are proactive to the changes are competitive
these firms extend their proactive strategies to their supply
partners, distribution, network and consumers and supply chain
management links and leverages the firm's competitiveness with
the supplier and distributor to meet the customer needs
the learning objectives are to outline the business environment factors
and fulfill the social responsibilities
the supply chains for competitive firms are proactive
to the environmental challenges and opportunities
now, an exercise to assess your skills
to apply your knowledge, read the case given below
and answer the questions
music
list the environmental factors that has an impact on supply chain,
suggest supply chain management strategies to overcome the situation
and to stay competitive in the field
and its impact on supply chain decisions and to elucidate a
thank you and hope to see all with good solutions to solve the problems
of business sensitive supply chain management systems
strategic process to design environmentally sensitive supply chains
dear learners welcome you all to the session on business
environment and supply chain competitiveness and by the end
of the session, you can foresee the business environment and its
impact on supply chain decisions and incorporate changes in the
business environment in competitive supply chains,
designs and management business environment consists of forces
good day all and welcome you all to today's session on business
and factors that are beyond the control of businesses
but influence management decisions this indicate that conducive
business environment defines industry existence and firm's
adaptations to domestic demand and business environment, shapes
its competitiveness through innovation and upgradation
the forces in the business environment that impact the
competitiveness of an industry are regulatory
economic, social and technological, commonly known as rest might be
because rest of the business decisions depend on these factors
the regulatory business environment is formulated by the
environment and supply chain competitiveness
government legislations, industrial policies, exim
policies, tariff and non-tariff barriers, regulations and
controls and measures for sustainable industrial growth,
infrastructural development, citizen well being and job creation
the economic environment indicates the
resource availability and allocation, demographic
dividend, purchase power and consumption, savings and
expenditure, interest rates, inflation, taxation, currency
exchange rates, unemployment rates, and economic recession or depression
the social environment is created by the
business environment and business operations do not function in isolation
members of the society to which you and i
belong and also your customers belong
the social environment is reflected as values, beliefs,
practices and behaviors of the members of the society
the social environment is unique to each country and subgroups
within a country and influence the business decision making
styles and business practices technological environment on
the other hand, indicate the breakthrough and incremental
innovations in the products and processes that change the role
of business games the phase at which technology changes,
michael porter advocates that competitive
the cost escalation and productivity efficiency due to technological
changes all indicate that there are changes in the business environment
in simple words, each operation or activity of a
firm should be designed and implemented to leverage the
opportunities and threats of business environment and supply
chain management is not an exemption
the business environment and the related supply chain decisions is
discussed based on the construction industry,
specifically the housing sector in india some of the regulatory
environments that have high impact on the housing sector are
advantage of nations depends on how upgraded and innovative the
economic housing for all as a thrust area of the government,
high taxation for buying and selling houses, transparency in
registration and approval for construction and facilities,
regulations and controls on resources like cement, sand,
iron and steel for environmental sustainability, linkage of
citizen carts and pan cards for all transactional processes
the economic environment indicates that disposable income have
accelerated habits of consumption, spiralling prices
and inflation has increased the cost of housing, interest rates
on loan and tax concessions encourage investments in housing
firms in an industry are this session on business
sector, the impact of environmental economics on
natural resources, renewable energy and carbon footprints
indicate the need for resource substitutes and processes that are sustainable
the social environment that impacts today's
housing sector are the existence of nuclear families and demand for
small houses, high mobility and nuclear families have led to
lack of social networks and demand community housing with
proximity to all facilities and safety changing consumption
patterns indicate a house as a luxury with unique interiors,
home furniture and appliances the environment and health
environment and supply chain competitiveness aims to address
consciousness of the consumers create demand for
facilities like walking space, gym, kitchen garden, renewable
energy sources, and so on within the community
technological impact is found in the raw materials used and the processes
of construction, digitally integrated smart houses that
ensure safety and communication facilities, renewable energy
resources that can be recycled or the need of the hour
in this scenario, what is expected by the customer is a
unique house with all facilities at an optimal price
since the end to end processes are standardized and transparent,
the questions when and how firms in an industry innovate and
and investment high, the customers expect the houses to
be handed over within a period of six to twelve months
to a constructor it means the project of building the community
house with all inbuilt facilities without delay,
and it involves huge investment and this is where supply chain
management becomes a strategic tool for competitive advantage
what should supply chains do to cope up with such situations?
supply chain should leverage on supply side commoditization and
demand side customization supply chain management is about
monitoring the business environments and foreseeing the
upgrade and what should be the strategic outlook of supply chain
music
supply chain process that focuses on learning
and improving can challenge any crisis in the business
environment and provide results that are repeatable hope that
you all are convinced that global supply chain focusing on
creating customer value can drive performance towards
efficiency and cost reduction and also bring in the strategic
fit to maximize customer satisfaction by leveraging on
the variety and responsiveness now the exercise for you is:
list four reasons as to how a supply chain management system
can help firms gain competitive advantage design competitive
stay competitive in the marketplace and the role of
supply chain management systems for a pharmacy shop in your neighborhood
so, with the hope that you're all tuned to develop
competitive supply chains, this is dr p chitramani,
closing the session on performance, strategic fit
and competitiveness of supply chain management systems
thank you
supply chain management in creating customer value
the learning objectives of this session is to provide
an understanding on value creation and value chain and illustrate the
contribution of supply chain management in customer value creation
the learning outcome on completion of this course is,
one can understand the strategic importance of supply chain to
create customer value welcome you all to a session on
customer value creation through strategic supply chain management
what is a customer value? we are all consumers and if i ask you,
hi all and welcome to the last part of competitive
what is the value assigned to the car that you want to own?
and the one that you dream of? what will you tell?
iam sure each one of you will name the brand that is favorite to you
and when asked why do you think so? i am sure you will list the
benefits you enjoyed and you anticipated and you would also
make a reference to the price the cost of the car and whether
it is cheap or whether it is worth the price you paid there
now you have have an answer yes, customer value is the
satisfaction that the customer enjoys in relation to the cost
of the product or service what do firms do to create value
advantage of supply chain management i start this session
and capture the competitive positions? firms just do not
sell products or services but in reality, they provide bundles
of differentiated benefits through their value-added
products and services at a very competitive price to achieve
this, the firm's strive for low cost leadership, differentiation
or focus differentiation the firms today have realized that
the combination of low cost and differentiated services create
that customer value that the firm wants to create
and these firms continuously work towards two areas, one is cost
reduction, and the next is quality improvement
on strategic supply chain with few questions for you to answer
the competitive firms have realized that operational efficiency
across the supply chain operations create customer value
this induced me to answer the question can supply chain
management be that core processes that can create
customer value? and i got the answer as "yes", from the video of
professor ananth iyer who has co- authored the book on toyota
supply chain and i will discuss some of their ideas on how and
what the supply chain processes can do to create customer value
as we all know toyota is a global company that sells its
various brands across the world, and the supply chain management
and they are: what brands come to your mind when i say computers,
there can be explained with an acronym that is coined by the
authors of the book 'toyota supply chain management'
in their words, supply chain management at toyota is about v four l
where v one is the velocity that is the speed at
which the products are manufactured
v two is the variability, the fluctuation in the sales at every detail level
and v three is the visibility, the visibility of the product
flow to everyone involved in the process, and v four is variety
this is a key focus and it indicates varity of the
products sold, products sold at various occasions and the
mobile phones and why did you buy it? and what is your retail
interactions of variety with the cost toyota directs the supply
chain plans across these four vs at individual car levels
and l indicates learning the success of supply chain at
toyota is the process, the process of learning
at toyota learning happens at all levels the employees are empowered to
identify problems, fix problems and initiate changes and this
empowerment is extended to the suppliers, distributors and the customers
the idea from all can be incorporated into the process
but the process is still stable without any chaos
process being the key there does not only fixed
outlet that is favorite to you, your food joint, your dream car
problems, but it provides results or solutions that are repeatable
the key points from toyota supply chain process
that help other firms to design supply chains that have a
strategic fit are: the supply chain is tuned to maximize
customer satisfaction and everything else is a constraint
customer centric supply chains focus on planning the four vs
namely velocity, variability, visibility and varity
at individual product levels detailing at individual product
levels held to think of customers satisfaction and the related
cost at individual customer level process is the key at
or a bike and so on i am sure you would name that brand that
toyota and it reflects the power of learning empowered employees
and incorporating suggestions from at all levels from supplier to
the customers into the process results in cost reduction
and quality improvement supply chain process
interact with the business environment and the confidence that the process
would work during crisis is the key to improve fixed problems
and bring in changes in the involvement of all the
stakeholders of supply chain designing and extending supply
chains that can connect the customers to the supply chain
process, help, get suggestions on design changes, quality issues,
satisfied you or the one that is anticipated to satisfy you is?
and many more the core take away from toyotas cases, the main
driver of a supply chain is link between the variety
and supply chain cost supply chain processes with strategic fit
should support firms to select the right level of variety of
products that deliver performance in short supply
chain management is a tool to gain competitive advantage
one key supply chain performance measure is customer value
created through supply chains the strategic fit of supply
chain is achieved when the supply chains can maximize
customer satisfaction, and minimize costs and when the
today's session is about how firms create customer value and
music
opportunities of supply chain we will end this lesson by
pinpointing six drivers of supply chain and the framework
of supply chain decision making the six drivers of supply chain
are facilities, physical location of production sites
and storage sites inventory is raw materials, work in progress
and finished goods along the supply chain
transportation indicates modes and routes of moving inventory from one point
of the supply chain to the other information, data, reports and
analytics about every component of the supply chain is indicated
as information sourcing: firms decision about whether the
impellers, challenges and drivers of supply chain
supply chain activity should be carried out inhouse or should
it collaborate with the partners who perform a particular supply chain activity?
the activities include production, supply of
goods and services, storage, logistics or transportation
and many more pricing: pricing indicates the firms monetary
value for products and services in its supply chain
the supply chain decision framework is as follows:
the logistical drivers namely facilities, inventory and transportation
and the cross functional drivers, information, sourcing and pricing will
determine the nature of supply chain structure that is the
the learning objective of this session is to identify the impellers and
extent of efficiency and responsiveness that align with
the supply chain strategy and competitive strategy
hope you all understood the drivers and challenges in supply chain
the forth coming sessions will discuss each of the decision
framework components in detail
thank you and a practical exercise for you:
identify the supply chain of any popular
manufacturer, brand or retail outlet and list the impellers
and uncertainties faced by the organization
pinpoint three solutions provided by them to meet the opportunities
uncertainties in supply chain and drivers of supply chain
and challenges in supply chain
thank you
music
the learning outcome is by the end of the session, you will be
able to link the logistical and cross functional drivers to
leverage the impellers and overcome the uncertainties
we will look into the impellers in today's markets,
organizations strive to maximize their profits by sustaining
customer satisfaction and leveraging their supply chain to
meet the market forces for this the supply chain managers ask some questions
dear learners, welcome you all to a session on drivers and
the questions are: will changing customers
and market space influence supply chain performance?
will globalization impact supply chain performance? and will
technology change the way supply chains can be leveraged for competitive advantage?
these questions have identified three
major impellers of supply chains as customers and markets,
globalization, technology we will look into the customers
and markets the customer and market forces that accelerates the
supply chain functions are empowered information rich
customers, variety and quality seeking customers,
challenges of supply chain the functions of supply chain and
demand for value in products and services,
power shift to customers, hyper competitive market, breakthrough
and innovative products and services, technology embedded
products, environmentally friendly customers and organizations
these forces propel organizations to implement
responsive, cost efficient and sustainable supply chains
globalization, the global business environment is
characterized by globally operating companies, dispersed
markets, manufacturing facilities and sourcing opportunities
increased geographical scope of business operations
the strategic importance of supply chain as discussed in
and global distribution and channel partners
outsourced service providers are common in global environment
this global supply chain has propelled optimisation
of global supply chains that can overcome the international trade
barriers and minimize cost and time what has this done to supply chains?
this has led to supply chain strategies like
rapid demand forecasting, outsourcing and global logistics management
we will move on to understand the impact of
technology developments on supply chain in supply chain
management, technology is an impeller as it is a means
the previous sessions indicates that supply chain is a core
to automate and reduce manufacturing cycle time,
access real time data to overcome supply chain uncertainties,
ensure visibility across supply chain, simplify supply chain by
eliminating unnecessary links and reduced wastage,
enhanced communication across extended supply chain
these requirements has led to the implementation of technology enabled
supply chain tools like material requirement planning, manufacturing
resource planning, enterprise resource planning, vendor
managed inventory, total assets visibility, velocity
manufacturing and point of sales data capture tools like rfid
function from a customer and organizational perspective
some of the latest supply chain technology trends are
industrial robotics, multi dimensional printers and additive
manufacturing, analytics and artificial intelligence,
internet of things and big data, blockchain, drones and driver less
vehicles, immersive technology like virtual reality with the
market forces and technology propelling the supply chains,
the supply chains of successful brands looks seamless
but is this true? in reality supply chain managers face and overcome
supply chain uncertainties? the supply chain uncertainties are
unpredictable or sudden changes in the business conditions,
and supply chain management is a core function to achieve
government regulations and competitive conditions,
the supplier network and the environmental considerations
so, what are the three types of supply chain uncertainties?
the three types of supply chain uncertainties are: supply
uncertainity, process uncertainty and demand uncertainty
the supply uncertainty is related to the uncertainty in resource
supply and this may be due to: non availability of resources,
insufficient supply capacity, fluctuations in material price,
uncertain supply lead times, lack of flexibility in production or
use of resources, third party transportation and logistics issues
competitive advantage having understood the integrated supply
we will move on to process uncertainties
process uncertainty is related to the likely disruption
in the manufacturing process,
due to machine non availability, labour issue, instable working capital,
manufacturing and information technology problems,
transportation and material handling issues
demand uncertainty supply chain managers aim to meet the
customer demands the demand uncertainty is the change in the
customer demand caused by changes in customer needs and in
qualtity required, expectation of short lead time, increase in
chain management process, its goals and strategies and the
variety of products, multiple options of distribution channel
and payment modes, innovations leading to new products and
product versions, retailing scenario and virtual market space
these impellers and uncertainties are met by the
organizations with flexibility in supply chains supported by
collaborative production planning of supply chain, demand
forecasting and supply network management, demand driven
strategies, mrp with uncertainity, just in time inventory or
integrated safety stock, multiple sourcing techniques
and optimization of stock on knowing the challenges and
strategic importance, we will move on to understanding the
hi, learners welcome you all to a lesson on strategic sourcing
bought, if the firm decides to make when and where should the
product be manufactured and kept available is the
decision of supply chain if the firm decides to buy the decision
areas are, should the supply base consists of single source or
multiple source, local, regional or international suppliers,
subcontractors, retailers, distributors or wholesalers,
small scale manufacturers or large scale manufacturers
each category of suppliers have their pros and cons and the decision
is based on the category profile, specialized services, quality
assurance, and lead time for supplier selection, market
total cost of product ownership,
information is gathered across the supplier capabilities
the activities are request for information,
the request for information referred to as (rfi)
seeks information on: product specification and know how,
quality and operational policies, financial stability, service level
acceptance, country of origin and manufacturer, and client preferences
the next step is to review the supplier
and solicit request for proposal
to review the supplier, the market information
and data from request for information is matched
long-term partnership with suppliers, value addition through
with the category profile and sourcing strategy or request for
proposal is solicited to assess the pricing and
commercials from potential suppliers supplier profile is
matched for production categories supplier evaluation and selection
the supplier is evaluated based on total cost of
ownership which includes purchase cost, operating cost,
maintenance cost, training cost, logistics, less salvage value
total system cost is the total cost of doing business with the supplier
this includes supplier costs and profits, interaction
cost and buyer costs performance metrics include
procurement of best products and services
product specification and quality metrics, responses to
request, delivery accuracy, and warranty clarity and execution
and customer satisfaction request for quotation is
encourage at this stage to ensure the value and negotiation is carried out
the selection of the supplier is based on the: best value,
continuous improvement policies,
and innovations from the supplier next is how to
maintain supplier relationship management the important
function in strategic sourcing is to establish long term
relationship with the suppliers this can be done by: establishing
let us briefly understand the
good working relationship, ensuring trust during
negotiations, effective contract management processes,
and follow the principle of keiretsu and develop network
composed of manufacturers, supply chain partners, distributors, who
work closely together to ensure product innovation and development
thank you, and we will meet in the next class on purchase activities
strategic sourcing process sourcing is the process of
identification, selection and development of supplier network
the process of strategic sourcing is addressed as three
major areas of procurement namely
need analysis, total spend analysis, category
profiling, organizations create category profile
in the last session, we discussed the procurement management and
what resources are sourced? the decision involves should the
organization make or buy? sort resources needed as categories
and follows sourcing strategies at this point
organizations design sourcing strategies for every material
or component needed based on the category profile
the third is from whom to source?
create a supply base, where can the resources be obtain, from
whom can the resources be obtain and how to ensure supplies,
organizations create supplier profile and processes
and link them to the materials
it's link with supply chain traditionally, procurement was
and components in this phase let us discuss and
understand each phase one by one, phase one, resource
requirement identification or what resources are needed?
procurement and sourcing are triggered when the organization
stimulates the need for materials, components,
and services based on demand forecasting and production plans
or new product develpment this phase consists of three steps
the first is need analysis need analysis identifies
the materials and components needed to meet the demand for the
product and services the new product development and specific
viewed as a transactional process from issue of purchase order, order confirmation,
materials and components needed any product enhancements and
change in specifications of the material and components needed
the next is total spend analysis
spend analysis identifies the areas of cost reduction from the
expenditure data across the organization procurement is a
cost center and the total cost of ownership includes not only
the purchase price, but also the hidden acquisition cost
total spend analysis helps to identify areas to decrease procurement
and process cost spend analysis categorizes resources based on
volume and the value profile the category, the two step process
and follow up material receipt and payment but contemporary
that can be followed for category profiling are
prepare bill of material
and categorize the resource requirement
at multiple levels bill of material is a complete set of
items required to develop the product to specification of the consumer
the items for building a material includes raw
materials, components, assembled products in specific quantities
on identification of the need and spend areas
the finalized resource requirement is categorized based on product
category, quantity use, types and sizes it is also grouped
procurement focuses on optimizing the supply base
across the products, users, location processes, and the members
for example, the bill of material for manufacture of
the shirt will include: fabrics ribs, buttons, threads, labels for
the size, hang tags, packing bags with specifications of
quantity for each type of shirt
the category profile for the shirt can
be develop based on the fabric used, product type that is formal
or casual, fabric type that is cotton or woollen,
clients specifications that is routine, new or branded clients, and location
phase two of strategic sourcing is category profiling
through collaborative approach and continuous improvement
and sourcing strategy what resources are sourced?
the decision on what resources are to be sourced depends on two
operations namely, make or buy decision and creating sourcing
strategies based on category profile when to make and when
to buy the product? makers favorable when agency
cost is less, quality, design, secrecy, patent and
proprietorship need to be protected, suppliers are not
reliable and incompetent, leveraging excess capacity
or backward integration, lead time and logistics advantage
buyers favorable when transaction cost is less, firm lack expertise,
what is strategic sourcing?
multiple specialized and committed suppliers are available,
leveraging limited capacity and workforce instability,
specialized low volume and supplier partnership advantages
the resources needed are categorized
to create category profile and link it to the sourcing strategy
the resources needed are categorized based on supplier
risk and procurement value
as routine leverage bottleneck and strategic products
the sourcing strategies for these products categories are: general
system of subcontracting for routine products, competitive
strategic sourcing is a component of supply chain
bidding for leverage products, performance based contract for
bottleneck products and collaborative supply chain
for strategic products the deliverable of this phase is
organizations decide on the sourcing strategy for every
material or component needed based on the category profile
the third phase in strategic sourcing is supplier profile and
supplier relationship management the phase provides
answers to: from where the resources can be obtained? from
whom it can be obtained? and how to ensure supplies?
creating a supply base involves, if the products are being made or
that focuses on: continuous improvement of the purchase activities,
dear learners in this lesson we will discuss series of
purchasing cycle and consists of the following: recognize and
describe the need, stock check, prepare supplier list, request
for proposal and quotation, issue purchase order, acceptance
and acknowledgement of order by the supplier follow up,
receipt and inspection, invoice check and completion of order
we will look into the steps one by one the first step, recognize and
describe the need starts or is triggered when by the firms
department or its stores section the need is notified by
either a standard purchase requisition or and material
requirement planning if the need is a one-time purchase,
activities to be taken up to complete procurement
then an engineering bill of material is used
the requisition is an internal document and most companies use
a standard format the user generally makes minimum of two
copies, one for the purchase department and the other for the
user department file normally the information in the form are
the descriptions of the material, quantity and the date required,
estimated unit cost and the authorized signature
once the requisition is received, it is checked to see if the item is in stock
today it is easily possible to verify stocks with
computer systems in place firms load the information and prices
this series of actions are termed as purchase procedure
for the commonly used materials on to the server
and user then make requisitions electronically
programmed inventory monitoring systems automatically place orders
when certain reorder points are reached it must be ensured that
the requisition made by the departments are clear, complete
and appropriately described the buyer has to check the
accuracy of the content of the requisition
after the requisition is received by the buyer, the purchase department
starts to look out in the market to identify potential sources of supply
in the cases of routine products for which supplier
procurement procedure and the documents serve to provide the
relationships are already established, the order is placed
with the listed suppliers for new or high value items
investigation of the supplier is made if the item is highly
technical or complex a cross functional team is formed to
qualify suppliers and make team decision about the most suited supplier
after qualifying a group of potential suppliers,
the buyers may request for proposal or quotations
for competitive bidding and negotiation a comparative statement is
prepared to assess all potential vendors across the required parameters
supplier selection and placement, once suppliers have been
framework for supply of materials and provide the means
selected, the purchase order with details is prepared
this becomes a legal contract document with quality
specifications, product specifications, quantity, price,
delivery terms and payment terms, and it should be clearly
stated to avoid disputes later most companies include terms and
conditions which usually provide legal protection to the buyer
on acceptance and termination of the contract multiple copies of
purchase order are prepared for communication to internal
and external stakeholders of the order in most cases orignal
copy of the purchase order is sent to the supplier
for processing information from various departments to complete
no contract is complete until the order is accepted by the supplier
an acknowledgement is sent to the buyer mentioning
their terms of supply in case of conflict in terms, law omits
these terms leaving settlement of conflict to negotiation
hence, buyers need to review suppliers acceptance with great care
the purchase department's responsibility does not
end with the order it has to take the responsibility till
materials are delivered and accepted important orders with
critical delivery dates should receive regular follow up attention
when a consignment is received, it is checked for
the job on hand let us look at the basic operating procedures
various details using purchase order and the shipment slip
it is also inspected for quantity and general condition
and a receiving report is prepared these days, much of the clerical
work is reduced using a computer- based system with bar-code identification
before some shipments are accepted,
a technical inspection may be necessary
copies of this inspection report are sent to the purchasing and accounting sessions
simultaneous review of the purchase order, the receiving
report and the invoice is done to determine the quantity and the
type of material ordered and received
that integrates the activities into a complete purchasing cycle
it should be done soon after receiving invoice
to enable from payments which go a long way
in maintaing good supplier relationship
once the invoice auditing is done and the payment is made, the order is closed
thank you learners and an exercise for you,
pinpoint five procurement issues that are faced by you in your everyday life
can any one of the strategic of procurement systems
help in handling the situation better in the future
if as list the strategies
thank you
the general cycle of activities for purchase is standardized
the following steps make up a typical

mass customization takes to another level of
manufacturing mass production and custom made with lower
unit cost hence, different mass customer groups are targeted in
mass customization rather than a single client mass customization
is used in different business and allows user to
change their requirements it is also known as made to order
or bill to order learning objectives: understand the
concept of mass customization and supply chain management,
demonstrate the approaches and current trends in mass
customization and supply chain in specific business contexts,
department of business administration avinashilingam
describe the strategies, challenges of mass
customization and supply chain management, explain the impact
of mass customization on supply chain management activities learning outcomes:
by the end of the session, the learners will be able, to analyze
the impact of mass customization on supply chain management,
apply the strategies of mass customization and supply chain
management on various business activities, develop strategies
for mass customization for different organization,
application of various approaches to mass customization in business
let us see what is mass customization?
institute for home science and higher education for women
mass customization: it allows the customer to design a
particular feature for the product keeping the cost closer
to that of mass-produced products in certain cases,
the components of the customized product are modular
the flexibility that is available in mass customization
allows the customer to mix and match various options
to create semi custom final product
mass customization is applied in various fields such as retail
industries, software industries for example, the software
creators may use mass customization to include
coimbatore tamil nadu dear learners welcome you all to the
software based product configurations which helps their
end users to add or change the specific function of the core product
mass customization and its approaches mass customization
is done in four ways they are collaborative customization,
adaptive customization, cosmetic customization, and transparent customization
the first type of customization is collaborative customization
collaborative customization: where the company
talks to the client and help them recognize what they need
the company identify the factors that fulfills the needs of the
customers and change the product configuration according to the
module on mass customization and supply chain management
client needs and create a customized product for the client
this approach comes under mass customization
and it is highly customer centric collaborative customization
helps the client to identify exactly what they want, when the
customer gets confused between huge variety of options
the customer need is designed as customized product through
collaborative customization the second type of customization
is adaptive customization adaptive customization is one
where there is no change in the client representation and the
product configuration under adaptive customization
mass customization means emphasizing changes to the product or
the business offer one standard product to the customers which can be
optimized to suit customer expectations under various situations
the product is designed in such a way that it
can be customized by the end user this type of approach is
more suitable for client- base business cosmetic customization:
in cosmetic customization, there is no change in the standard of
product, but there is change in representation of the product by the client
under cosmetic customization, the company
advertise a standard product to different group of customers
cosmetic customization works well when the customer uses the
services in order to suit a particular group of customers
same product but the client position it's differently under
cosmetic customization the standard of the products is not
customized, but the products are packed differently to suit
different kinds of customers in this approach,
the company advertise the features
and benefits of the product in different manner
the promotional campaigns are designed differently and in
cosmetic customization, the product mostly carries the
client name this approach offers a great value to maximum
number of clients the next type of approach is the transparent
it is the process of delivering wide market goods and services
customization in this approach the company offers various
changes in the product, but there is no change in
representation of the clients transparent customization
produces customized product for the individuals
without informing them that the products are exclusively made for them
this approach is applicable for the businesses
only when the client-needs are predictable the business that
deals with transparent customization analyse
the client's behavior without having a direct communication with them
then the company customize the product for their client
after modify to satisfy a specific customer needs
with this basic understanding of mass customization and it's
approaches a small exercise for you identify any two
organizations that adapt collaborative customization
and adaptive customization approach thank you and welcome you all
for the next two lessons in mass customization and supply chain management
mass customization is a combination of personalization and flexibility
dear learners! hope you have enjoyed the lesson one on mass
supply chain management is a continuous process or activity from
sourcing of raw materials or components that is needed to
create product or services and deliver to the end users
supply chain management is a network of business processes where all
the business activities are integrated with one another
supply chain management is a network of activities involving
from procurement of raw materials manufacturing, which
involves converting the raw materials into finished products
and distribution management, which involves selling the
finished goods to the customers supply chain management is
customization and its approaches
called as an art of management of providing the right product
to the right customer at the right place at the right time at
the right cost to the customers next comes, the supply chain
management strategies for an organization supply chain
strategies are considered to be the backbone of today's business organization
the major strategies for better supply
chain management in the current scenario are: the business
organization can adapt a demand driven planning and business
operating model based on the real time demand insights and
demand shaping adapting and agile supply chain with rapid
welcome you all to the second lesson
planning an integrated execution is followed by organizations
the business organization can optimize the product designs
and product management for supply, manufacturing,
and sustainability to accelerate profitable innovation
the company can align the supply chain with
business goals by integration sales and operations planning
with corporate business planning the organization can
embed sustainability into supply chain operations which
help the organization in reducing carbon inefficiencies
with minimized energy consumption, less wastage with
on mass customization and supply chain management
three r such as recycle, reuse, refurbish material, and
optimize travel and transportation the organization
can ensure reliability and predictable supply with help
of the business houses to avoid shortfalls working on continuous
improvement and operational excellence strategies is a
foundation for successful end- to-end supply chain operations
supply chain management strategy involves effective market
coverage, availability of products at all location
and ease of customer use whenever a product is introduced in the
market and advertise the product should be easily available for
the second lesson deals with supply chain management and its strategies
the customers at all sales counter so that the customers
can easily buy the products suppose, if the product is not
available at the right time at the right place, it may drop the
interest of the customers in purchase decision
the two critical elements or the inventory visibility in
operation in supply chain management and it may have the
direct impact on cost drivers and the bottom line on the
balance sheet inventory management value and it is an
asset for the company every business organization must have
a standard for inventory turnaround which is optimum for the business
let us see what is supply chain management? supply chain
inventory turn around means how many number of times
the inventory has been sold and replaced over a period of twelve months
the strength of the inventory relates to the strength of the business
in the global context the finished good inventory is
held at many locations such as distribution
centres and are managed by third parties apart from the
inventory with distributors and retail stocking points lot of
inventory would also be in the pipeline in transportation
suppose if there is any loss of inventory anywhere in the supply
chain it would result in the loss of value effective
management involves a wide range of activities such as planning,
control of inventory and visibility of inventory acts as
a major key factor of supply chain management function
current trend and technology of mass customization
the automated manufacturing machinery are incorporated with
order taking to enable customization
it is most important for mass customized product lines
the company that is involved in numerous mass production combines the order
receipt and fulfillment with the internet- based client interface
in real time with the help of internet the companies can
easily interact with their clients and create opportunities
controlling, and executing the product flow from the
for mass customization internet has improved the delivery system
with the customer interacting through various sources like
mobile apps, emails, promotions, or online progress tracking system
various companies such as: individuals com, newspages,
and yahoo are utilizing the internet for creating customized
news items for their visitors most of the business
organization are using ease of online platform to enable the
client to design their products the music based companies like
volatile media and music maker are very successful in their arena
through delivering customized series with this basic
procurement of raw materials to the production and distribution
understanding of supply chain management and its strategies
for an organization, a small exercise for you identify any
three best strategies adopted for supply chain management in
organizations straight, some current technology of mass customization
thank you, and welcome you all for the third lesson
in mass customization and supply chain management
of the product to the end users in a cost-effective way
dear learners! hope you have enjoyed the lesson two on supply
conclusion: mass customization is relatively new
phenomena gaining acceptance by many companies as the
marketplace continues to evolve and technologies provide greater
abilities for the manufacturer, mass customization should
continue to grow in recent years, mass customization has
gained the growing attention of different industries one of the
major obstacles for the company's going for mass
customization is to design their mass customization manufacturing system
mass customization manufacturing system should
mainly focus on flexibility with customers and quick
the biggest challenge of mass customization is that
responsiveness to individual customer order it is based on
balance between pure customization and mass production
the success of customized product manufacturing
is dependent on the product and process development
it also addresses the importance of leveraging basic choice
offerings and wide variety offerings with this basic
understanding of challenges of mass customization
and customization strategy, a small exercise for you identify any
two organizations that adopt tailored customization strategies
thank you
it is not appropriate for all market customers and products
in most of the products the customers are not interested in
getting a customized product like light or bulb or washing
detergent etc at the same time, the cost of the customized
product is also very high and the customer has to wait
for a longer time to get them
the second challenge is adaptation for the basic product
mass customization is successful for the luxury product
such as designer wear and cars
chain management and its strategies for an organization
this concept works better for high end products,
whereas mass customization is
not economically feasible for most of the business which
produces the basic products in most of the business profit
earned by the customization does not outweigh the complexity and
cost of producing the customized product the next challenge is
replacement and reverse logistics when a customer
returns a customized product, it may create a lot of problem for
the manufacturers in most cases, the situation might not
arise as the product are designed according to the
welcome you all to the third lesson on mass customization
configuration made by the customers but if some return
takes place in such a case, the business should have the
mechanism to reverse the customized product, else it
might face many issues because the chance of getting another
customer wanting the same product as someone else are too narrow
it may lead to the business to a tricky situation
majority of the companies do not have the written policy
the next challenge is supply chain optimization the major barrier
faced by the organization in mass customization is efficient
handling of supply chain it is difficult for the business to
and supply chain management the third lesson deals with
handle supply chain in an effective manner
since the system of suppliers are already optimized and designed for a
prearranged number of products rather, meeting an unforeseen demand
most of the companies have not integrate the latest <?>tthe</?>
supply chain management applications like jit,
automated planning and it might result in problems of flexibility and visibility
in the current scenario supply chain is based on push model whereas
mass customization is based on pull model
it is very difficult for the business to manage
the problem in supply chain can be solved only when the business
challenges of mass customization and customization strategies
can balance between mass customization
and mass production to create standard product
the product that is produced can be configured in a manner
that they can be customizable in the future
for most of the business, it is not possible
and it is not economically feasible to start the customization
process at the start of supply chain it indicates that the
business are able to implement mass customization partially
this method is also advantageous for the manufacturers since the
concept increase the scope of the product also it helps the
now, let us see the challenges of mass customization
manufacturer to meet the needs of different types of consumers market
this method introduces a new target market for the
manufacturer and allow them to explore the possibility of
manufacturing products for them
next comes the customization strategies
lampel and mintzberg during the year one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six
has proposed five customization strategies,
where the customer can define the product specification
at the operation stage the five customization strategies are pure standardization
segmented standardization, customized standardization,
there are various challenges, the organization has to face during
tailored customization and pure customization four stages are
consider such as design, fabrication, assembly and distribution
the shaded stage represents standardization
and the unshaded stage represents customization
the first type is pure standardization in pure standardization,
the product is not customized for the customers the company
pushes the product as how it is manufactured
in all the four stages the company maintains standardization
the customer also buy them as offered by the company
the next one is segmented standardization
mass customization they are challenges with high cost,
in segmented standardization, the customer does not have the
direct influence on the final product the customer has to
choose between options the vendor decide to offer
in segmented standardization there is higher degree of flexibility
the customers can influence on the distribution process
the next type is customized standardization the customer can
influence on the final product by choosing between standardized
components is called customized standardization the production
remains standardized in design and fabrication process where as
the process is customized in the assemble and distribution
adaptation for basic products, replacement and reverse
process where the customer specifications are met
the next is tailored customization tailored customization occurs
when the customer has the ability to alter the
specification of the product to some extent during fabrication stage
in tailored customization the standardization is
maintained in the design stage, and the product is customized
from fabrication stage to the distribution stage
and the last is pure customization pure customization occurs only
when the customers can interfere on design stage itself
the entire process is customized for the customers according to their requirements
logistics, supply chain optimization the first one is high cost
hi learners! do you remember the story of the hare and the tortoise race?
dear learners! this module on agile supply chain
management focuses on how the organizations can implement
agile supply chains as two lessons, namely agile
businesses and its strategic importance, agile supply chain management practices
what do you understand by the word "agile"? is it flexibility to
move quickly and easily? yes, you are right then what do you
think of agility in business? does it mean organizations are
able to respond quickly to the changes in the business
environment? yes, you are correct
music
do you remember that tortoise won the race and not the hare?
agility in business means that the organization is able and
flexible to respond quickly to the changes in the business environment
music
benetton groups was formed in the early one thousand, nine hundred and sixty s and one of the
world's famous fashion company, with its well defined brand as
'united colors of benetton' and sisley it is <?>postioned</?> as a
<?>crew</?> with a bird's eye view on environment, human dignity and
social transformation the retail outlet has marked its
imprints worldwide, with an identity comprising of color,
ethnic fashion, quality at price and passion for work
what is the lesson you have learned? should the organizations in the
what is interesting with benetton spa is that it is in an industry,
which is dynamic and driven by trends and fads, with customers
wanting something new always what did benetton spa do to
achieve this success? it identified that the processes
are information intensive that the products have low
information content but the designs, production and
marketing processes are highly information intensive
it was identified that twenty percent of the new fashion ideas depended on
previous fashion ideas they leveraged this nature of the
business by recording the previous fashion in its database
competitive race be like a tortoise or like a hare? can the
and use them for supply chain decisions this reduce the
design time and increase the response time it identified ways
of using it for quick response to changes and fashion trends
some of the process specifications are: the computer
integrated manufacturing systems provided overnight adjustments of production
the worldwide licensees received the items
three times faster than the major competitors
production of garments was postponed until the order is placed, thereby
eliminating overstocking and reverse logistics
flexibility offered by computerized manufacturing systems allow
organizations move with lot of strength? but rest and delay
quick response and deleted slow moving items from the product
line but extended the production to fast moving items
for example, based on the information received from each
store immediately after each sale, the company dye their
sweaters to match the demand what did you understand from the
example of benetton spa? is benetton spa in agile business?
and what are the various agile activities of benton spa?
benetton spa is an agile organization it is quick in
thinking, doing and changing designs to meet the customer trends
the customer database is digitally integrated with all
reaching the target that is the customers?
its processes for designing, manufacturing, and customization
it has implemented dynamic forecasting,
mass customization, and postponement strategies for
quick response to customers
music
in a nutshell, agile organizations are customer centric that is they
focus on action to identify opportunities to meet customer
needs flexible, they implement dynamic forecasting, just in
time inventory postponement and supplier
interactive strategies for resource allocation and quick
no can the organizations hold on to the weaknesses and slowly respond
response to changes they are digitally integrated, that is
information flow between the processes are accurate and quick
for decisions and actions agile organizations are
digitally integrated across the processes from forecasting to
delivery of the products the strategic advantage of agile
organizations are customer sensitivity and quick response,
effective information flow and improved visibility, improved
quality advantage due to less inventory and less lead time to deliver
thank you all and meet you all in the next session on
agile supply chain management practices
to the customers like the tortoise? certainly no then what do you say?
music
the organization should be strong and quick in responding
to the customer requirements the organizations should be agile
dear learners! in the last session we have learned that agile
information flow across the supply chain to respond quickly to the customers
this paradigm change in organization has led
to implementation of agile supply chain management practices
music
the agile supply chain models are responsive
supply chain models agile supply chain models focus on:
meeting changing customer needs, shortening lead time, responses
to innovation and variety seeking customers, high service
level quality the two responsive supply chain models
are agile supply chain model and custom configured supply chain model
organizations are: customer sensitive, quick to respond to
the agile supply chain models are applicable when:
demand is very uncertain, firms earn high margins while demand
meets supply, product innovation, variety and availability
attracts customers, and cost is a secondary consideration
music
mckinsey and company suggests supply chain four zero - the next
generation supply chain for agile organizations
agile supply chain focuses on applications of internet of
things, big data analytics, advanced robotics and sensors
for quick customer responses and enhanced customer satisfaction
customers changing needs, digitally integrated for
music
the agile supply chain management practices in the digital era are:
music
dynamic forecasting: predictive analytics for forecasting market
trends, demand, shipping will be the basic supply chain
management practice predictive market trends and demand will
bring in agility in product design and resource allocation
predictive shipping helps agile organizations to postpone
delivery until the order is received but quicken the
delivery once the order is received companies like amazon
flexibility and visibility in this session, we'll explore how
forecast the customer demands, hold the products in shipment and
reroute the consignment once the customer orders is recieved
music
minimized planning cycle: agile supply chains leverage computer
integrated manufacturing system to enable real time production
flexibility, production capacity feedback and routing of shipments
music
the most important agile supply chain management practice in the
digital era is individualized product and delivery system to
each customer micro segmentation, mass customization
organizations implement agile supply chains to meet customer requirements
and specialized delivery systems like drones are the agile supply
chain management practices
music
efficient information flow: the performance of agile supply
chain is highly dependent on end to end real time information flow
agile supply chain management practices is to
integrate the information from the customers, suppliers, service
providers, distributors, and retailers the agile supply chains
embedded within the digital systems of an organization will
help the organization to be customer-sensitive and responsive
supply chain management is an integrated

management system for effective flow of material, information and
funds across the activities of demand forecasting, inbound
logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing and after
sales service the agile organizations focus on
lean supply chain management cost leadership or product
management practices learning outcomes: the expected learning
outcome of this module is that the learner should be able to
appreciate lean management, lean management practices and leagile practices,
identify lean, agile and leagile supply chain practices
now, let us move on to the first lesson on
lean supply chain management practices
music
what comes to your mind when you see someone lean? don't you say
the person is cute with no extra fat, healthy and fast
yes it is the same with lean practices by the organization
differentiation are the two major strategic decisions of organizations
the lean organization aims at cost leadership by elimination of
waste in all its operations
music
lean management is a management practice that focuses on cost
leadership through continuous improvement and incremental
changes for elimination of waste what are the areas where
lean organizations reduce waste? timwood is an acronym that
describes activities in manufacturing that can lead to
the waste and it represents transport, inventory, motion,
waiting, over processing, over production and defects
this strategic choice of organization has
don't you think all these activities are also a part of supply chain?
the activities described by timwood are all activities of
the supply chain too and lean supply chain management
practices are inbuilt into the organization that aim at
efficiency and cost leadership now, having understood the
importance of lean supply chain in waste elimination,
music
lean supply chain models are efficiency oriented supply chains
lean supply chain models are low cost supply chains that
focus on high utilization of assets, reduce the lead time and
grouped supply chain to be effective or responsive
wastage and availability and quality to meet customer expectations
the lean supply chain models are efficient
supply chain model, fast supply chain model and continuous flow
supply chain model the lean supply chain models are
applicable when demand has become more certain and supply is predictable,
margins are lower and intense competition is present,
price influences customer choice lean supply
chain management practices: organizations
who have implemented lean practices are known for the following
practices: managing demand signal and collaboration
the lean supply chains focus on effectiveness and agile supply
supply chain partners share demand forecast information
real time customer data from the point of sale system and usage data
pull the products across the supply chain
supply chain partners exchange product and sales data electronically
routine communication regarding products and sales statistics by
the key supply chain partners waste reduction and value
addition: in waste reduction and value addition, the supply
chain partners focus on cost reduction and work together to
eliminate waste supply chain partners understand end to end
processes and collaborate to eliminate waste throughout the supply chains
chains focus on responsiveness dear learners! in this
collaboration of suppliers and customers
eliminate non-value added activities the next is process and
product standardization: processes are documented and
shared with supply chain partners processes used by
various supply chain partners are well understood by all
planning production stock management processes are
standardized across the supply chain supply chain partners
actively look for opportunity to share components
during new product development products developed share
components from other product lines industry standards and
module we will focus on two lessons, lean supply chain
data standards: supply chain partners agree to standardized
products based on industry standards partners participate
and adapt industry standards in development and manufacture of products
key supply chain partners jointly developed data
mining to convert each other's proprietary formats
key supply chain partners use standardized data formats for information exchange
all the supply chain partners exchange information
using global standard data formats people and cross
enterprise collaboration: continuous improvement culture
is in place and resources are made for employee development
management and leagile supply chain management
employee believe that they are a valued asset and change
leaders are identified and educated on the need and the way
to bring changes management has published vision aligned with
operating objectives for all the facilities
cross company supply chain teams develop process improvement practices,
recognize opportunities and enact change for the benefit of
the entire supply chain these practices of lean supply chain
management are expected to eliminate three enemies of lean,
muda-waste, muri-overburden and mura-unevenness

or assortments delivered at convenient time and place
this is achieved by economy of scope
in product presentation and availability
organizations follow multiple channels of distribution, mass merchandising
through retail chains or shopping malls and e-commerce
for multi vendor support relevance value is achieved
through customization of product to suit individual customer needs
organizations achieved this by adding new
product features or functions to the base product to suit the
requirement of the customer for example, if students need more
orient on customer lifecycle, demand management processes
internet features than call features from a telecom service
provided the service provider gives a different package for the students
similar example would be different car features
like paint, color, auto gear, seat type, diesel and petrol engine etc
within a car plan the role of supply chain functions
can be summarized as follows: on understanding the customer
lifecycle, and the role of supply chain processes to move
the customer across the various phases, your assignment is to
plot the value created by the supply chain
across the customer lifecycle phases in the following case:
and supply chain management processes and to bring an
as indicated above, map the customer lifecycle processes
and the value created by the supply chain processes for mr x
throughout his lifecycle stages
thank you and in the next session, we will learn demand management
and integrated model of demand and supply chain management
thank you
music
understanding on the integration of demand chain and supply chain
processes across the customer lifecycle by the end of the module,
you will be able to define the supply chain
processes and demand management
processes to support the movement of the consumers across
the phases of customer lifecycle
with this brief introduction,
let us move on to the first lesson on what is customer
integrated model of customer lifecycle, demand management
lifecycle and the role of supply chain in customer lifecycle management?
imagine you are going to the college
and on the first day of your academic year,
you are informed that you will be learning all the subjects through
lectures, video lessons, google classrooms, and that some
subjects will be taught using spreadsheets and other applications
on hearing this, you identify your need for a smartphone or a laptop or
both on reaching home, you tell your parents that
you need a computer or a smartphone
they agree and give you a budget of fifty or to sixty thousand
and supply chain management dear learners welcome you all to the
for the requirement what will you do now?
you will search for information and gain awareness of the desktop
laptop and the smartphone you will evaluate the benefits
and decide which one to buy you will also gain awareness about
various configurations, brands and related prices
you will also evaluate the product based on
delivery time, after sales service and payment terms
on evaluation you will select a particular product and the brand,
buy it, use it and feel satisfied
after your studies you get a job
module on integrated customer lifecycle, demand management
and you feel the need for a new version of computer
if you are highly satisfied with the product that you are using,
you will evaluate the product and services in relation to the
one that you are using and you decide to buy the same brand
from the same retailer now what are the various phases that
you have undergone? the phases are: identify need that may be
fulfilled by a product or service that is available
develop awareness about the products and brands that exist
to satisfy your need learn more about the products, brand, services
and retailers that fulfill the needs consider how the products
and supply chain management
and services offered by various manufacturers
and retailers do or do not satisfy the identified need
evaluate the suitability of your product and service against others
decide to purchase the product or service from the retailer
buy and take delivery of the product or services use the product and services
and decide to buy the same brand or from the same
company or the retailer for your future needs
this is customer lifecycle
customer lifecycle describes the stages
that a customer goes through when identifying a need,
this module has three lessons that deals with
considering purchasing, using and maintaining loyalty to the
product or services the phases in customer lifecycle are
need identification, awareness, learning,
configuration, evaluation, acquisition, use, being loyal,
and to buy again and again
what do organizations, marketers and retailers do
to hold the customer across the whole customer lifecycle?
in simple terms, they gain the
attention of the potential customers, influence the customer
by providing the information about the products and services,
what is customer lifecycle and the role of supply chain management?
induce them to buy the product and convert them into paying
customers, retain the customers with enhanced products
and services, gain customer loyalty and turn them into companies advocates
organizations move across the customer lifecycle
by developing trust in the minds of the customers
with three business processes namely
include and engage, which includes their efforts to get a
prospect's attention, create awareness and engage in a
dialogue to move the customer into the customer lifecycle
acquire, educate the prospects, maintain attention, create interest
what is demand management and rainbird fusion model?
and motivate them to take buying decisions retain and expand:
design cross functional business strategies
to increase customer satisfaction and foister customer loyalty
in a properly defined customer lifecycle,
the marketers and retailers map processes clearly they hold the
customers across the customer lifecycle
what is the role of supply chain
to help marketers to map the processes
that can serve the customers throughout the customer lifecycle?
supply chain partners can provide information about
role of marketing and supply chain within demand management
the changing trends in needs, demands and delivery processes
supply chain functions create new ways to understand and
translate marketing initiatives into supply chain drivers
supply chain processes and functions helped the organizations
to provide the following values expected by the customers
the values that can be enhanced across the supply chain are
economic value which refers to the product with high quality at low price
this is achieved by organizations through economies of scale
and efficiency in product and service creation and delivery
market values created by convenient product variety
the learning objective of this module is to
hi learners, now coming back to the hare and the tortoise race hope
combines both lean and agile supply chain practices
organizations today have to provide unique individualized
products at the lowest cost in the competitive marketplace
what is leagile supply chain leagile supply chain aimed at
providing unique products to the customers in the dynamic
marketplace by practicing both lean and agile supply chain
practices across the supply chain, leagile supply chains
deploys the concept of decoupling point across the
supply chain decoupling point is a point in the supply chain
which is linked directly to the customer order the decoupling
you remember that we agreed that organizations today should
point because identified by the organization across the supply
chain activities and members in the supply chain, the processes
before the decoupling point, follow the lean supply chain and
after the decoupling point follow agile supply chain
practices this makes the supply chain management leagile
what is a decoupling point in leagile supply chain and how
to position the decoupling point in the supply chain can be well
understood by recalling the push and pull boundary in the supply
chain the form set boundary as to which of the supply chain
processor should be push processes and which of them
combine the quickness of a hare and commitment of a tortoise to
should be pull process this process classification as pull processes
and push processes said the push pull boundary interface between
the push base stages and the pull based stages is the push
pull boundary similarly, in the leagile supply chain management,
the decoupling point is a point where the customer order arrives
and the organization's change its supply chain process from
lean to agile the decoupling point is viewed as a boundary
between make the stock and make to order process across the
supply chain as made to stock process focuses on continuous
improvement, waste elimination and standardization lean supply
achieve success in the competitive race we have also
chain is suitable by made to order envisages flexibility and
responsiveness to customer orders agile supply chain
practices is appropriate
the decision about the decoupling point in the leagile
supply chain is influenced by market related factors that is
delivery time and reliability the band certainly and seasonality
order, frequency and size, standardization and
customization, supplier commitment and pricing and
positioning the product related criteria for decoupling point
decisions include product design and structure, cost of the
seen that agile supply chains are responsive and lean supply
product cost of folding and backorders product quality and
customization the process related factors for deciding
decoupling points are processed process, manpower and missionary
flexibility, production lead time and production bottlenecks
so, with this brief introduction to leagile supply chain, i let
you all explore more on this trend in supply chain thank you
chains are efficient now, the question is, can the supply
chains be efficient and responsive? the answer is and
that is leagile supply chains this lesson will introduce you
to leagile supply chains
leagile is a paradigm shift in supply chain management, which
hi learners, in today's competitive context
goods as in condition remanufacturing of products or
returned goods return the returned goods to the suppliers
the implementation of green supply chain practices is a
challenge to most organization and it requires the support of
management and customers the management support to green
practices are ensured by stakeholders commitment towards
environmental regulations and green practices cross
functional collaboration for improvement implementation of
total quality environment management eco-labelling of
the product the customer support for green supply chain
and organizational performance the module is designed to impart
practices are by collaborating with the suppliers to design eco
friendly products, clean processing, green packaging,
recycling and reusing of products the strategies for
implementation of green supply chain practices are design and
implement environmentally friendly practices, training and
audits across the supply chain continuous assessment of green
supply chain practices to identify possibilities of
internal recycling of materials implementation of green warehouse
and use of recycled packaging recovery and reuse of used
products the green supply chain practices are in practice
knowledge on the green supply chain drivers and practices and
as customers and corporate are very much looking forward to go
green thank you
the link of green supply chain with iso fourteen thousand and one lean supply
chain management and organizational performance on
learning the module, you will be able to appreciate the role of
supply chain to develop green corporates, apply green supply
chain practices to leverage it with lean practices and
organizational performance so, welcome you all and hope you
start to look at go green as a supply chain practice from now on
what is chain management? it is a process to manage the
organizations of focusing on lean and agile operations that
flow of materials, informations and funds from the supplier to
the end user good, can you tell me what are the various value
chain activities that can be linked to supply chain
management oh! it is inbound logistics, operations, outbound
activities, marketing and after sales services wonderful! you
have understood supply chain management activities no, tell
me are you worried about what is happening to the environment
around you? yes, i hear a lot of things like pollution,
chemically induced products, ozone layers, carbon imprints,
and what do you want to do about it? i want to be environmentally
is agile practices to delight the customers the customers on
conscious, use green products and support the government and
corporate initiatives to go green so, do you think supply
chain practices by corporate help you to be eco friendly?
yes, but how? in today's lesson, the focus is on what drives
supply chains to be eco friendly? what are the green
supply chain
practices?
green supply chains are supply chains wherein the upstream and
the downstream supply chain practitioners aim at minimizing
the environmental impact of both forward and reverse flow of
the other hand are moving towards green products go green,
materials, information and funds green drivers are
motivators that induce business organizations to adapt to green
supply
chain practices
the drivers that induce green supply chain practices are
customers, international markets, government regulations,
competitors, stake holders and industrial group
the customers today have gone environmentally friendly and
are looking for green products like organic food products, less
plastic and bio-degradable products, less use of creating
green products, green corporates are the buzzwords today
natural and pollution inducing resources customers who support
eco friendly products and processes are important drivers
of green supply chain management practices
corporates today are with international markets either
because the products are exported or because
international brands or competitors for the domestic
brands the global requirement for eco friendly products and
practices drives green supply chain practices some examples
are air and water quality standards and e-waste
management standards
corporates are positioning themselves as green corporates
government regulations and laws enforced by the government on
environmental damages, renewable resources and dumping of
products have triggered organizations to follow green
supply chain practices
environmentally friendly practices by global competitors
and cost advantage due to less wastage and recycling of
resources have triggered green thinking in supply chain
practices
demand and inducement from the community, industrial
association, interest groups ngos and management motivate
with green products what has go green got to do with supply
corporates to follow sustainable practices
supply chain management practices are spread across
activities, inbound logistics operations, outbound logistics
marketing and after sales service some of the green
supply chain practices across these activities are, green
inbound practices, profiling raw materials without
environmentally hazardous substances supplier
collaboration for environmentally friendly
objectives internal management coordination of suppliers
through environmental audits iso fourteen thousand and one certified suppliers
chain management? is the question that is answered as two lessons
and supply chain partners environment friendly practices
are all supplier tiers training of suppliers on environment
practices electronic information sharing with
suppliers localize to sourcing green operational practices,
products and services are designed for reduced use of
material and energy products are designed with features to reuse,
recycle and recover product designs favour environmentally
friendly materials and processes processes and
products comply with environmental protection
standards and regulations reduced carbon emissions in production
in this module green supply chain drivers practices and iso
processes use of fuel efficient tools and machines optimize
processes to reduce waste energy saving and resource
optimization to save energy and resources internal recycling of
materials with the production quality assurance and ongoing
assessment of green scm compliances the outbond
practices include use of less or package material reduce inventory
and handling of products use of green warehousing techniques
optimization of the localization of distribution order
consolidation the reverse logistics practicing include
recovery and reuse of used products resell of the returned
fourteen thousand relationship model, lean supply chain, green supply chain
this lesson on green supply chain management answers two
iso one hundred and forty thousand and one certification fosters the
culture of go green across the organisation by integrating
environmental issues with business operations for improved
efficiency and cost reduction and by continuous improvement of
environmental performance of an organisation
lean supply chain practices provide ways to cut costs and
improve operational efficiency from the customer perspective to
add value to the products and services, while green supply chain
management practices provide ways to eliminate waste from the
environment perspective and ensure sustainability now
questions what is the relationship of green supply
having understood what is iso 14,001? let us look what can
be the relationship between these three components?
a research on casual relationship between lean supply chain
practices, green supply chain management practices and
organizational performance considered two hundred manufacturing
firms and identified that there is a relationship between lean
adoption iso fourteen thousand and one and greens supply chain practices
some highlighting points of the research are- the assimilation of
lean practices by the organization can be captured by
the extent of lean adaptations and categorized as lean
chain management systems with iso fourteen thousand and one and lean supply chain
indicators, lean movers and lean adopters the research indicated
that iso fourteen thousand and one has a significant influence on a lean
supply chain practices, lean supply chain practices and
organizational performance in the presence of iso fourteen thousand and one
certification there was a difference in the lean
adaptation groups across the green supply chain practices in
the areas of green inbound logistics, green outbound
logistics and environmental performance
so, what does this mean? it means that iso fourteen thousand and one provides a
support system and culture that can be extended to lean supply
practices is there an impact of green supply chain management
chain management and green supply chain management
practices when organizations scale up their lean adaptation,
they can parallely implement iso fourteen thousand and one certification to foster
lean and green supply chain management practices
i would like to sum up the lesson on integrating lean and
green supply chain with an empirical model that was the
outcome of the research on crucial relationship between
lean supply chain practices, green supply chain management
practices and organizational performance construing two hundred
manufacturing firms this structural equation model
practices, lean supply chain practices and organizational
indicated that the green drivers comprising of customers,
international markets, governments, stakeholders
influence green support practices by the management and
the customers this in turn will affect the green supply chain
management practices of green in bond logistics, green operations
green outbound logistics and reverse logistics the lean supply chain
management practices of demand management, value
addition, process standardization, industry
standardization, lean culture and cross enterprise
collaboration influenced the green supply chain management
performance?
practices the green supply chain management practices and
lean supply chain management practices have an impact on
organizational performance that is environmental performance and
financial performance
effective green supply chain management practices can be
integrated with lean supply chain practices for implementing
efficient and environmentally sustainable supply chains thank
you and see you all in the next session
iso fourteen thousand and one is a certification that imbibes the culture of
commitment to protect the environment across the entire
organisation and the extended organisations it aims at
improving the environmental performance of an organization
hi students, this is dr arthi associate professor, department
you just connect to the centralized software and which
also connects to the manufacturers centralized
inventory so, wherever you get the products are sold out and
you will automatically the system will alert you when you
have to get the supplies from the customers, supplies from the
manufacturers so, it will there are additional systems which
allow you to automatically place the orders to the manufacturers
so and so date and will automatically project you how
many inventories are you required during the season and
also it predicts the future also so, the the current supply
chains for effective business operations in e commerce
chain management software's are you know capable of predicting
your inventory systems will in advance for example, if you're
in month of october, okay so, it will automatically check what
are the products have sold during the christmas season and
it will automatically alert you what are the things you have to
order it from the manufacturer and how many things how many
products are available in the manufacturers website so it
will automatically alert you so when you have to order reorder
the things again, let me explain about advantages and
disadvantages of drop shipping methods so the drop shipping
platform may i have the pleasure of introducing mr s raja
method advantages are you don't want to maintain any inventory
so you won't have any debt stocks in your you know system, as
well as because the lost of lot of retailers fail because of the
debt stocks even if you have, if you're selling ten products,
seven products might go well and three products may not go well
so, these three products stocks would take the seven products
profit so this is the major disadvantage is the retail
system so, this drop shipping method so the the seller does not
want to maintain any inventory on his own so, because he is
connected with the manufacturers so he is directly getting the
rajan, a person with great conviction and commitment to
products from the manufacturer and he's directly shipping to
the customers so he don't want to maintain any thing on his
own
the second thing is the disadvantage what i see from
this dropshipping model is when the manufacturer running out of
stock, he does not have an intimate that we are running out
of stock so, but still he he sells he, he advertise his
products on his platforms, let's say amazon or wherever and the
people are buying it and whenever when he tried to place
the order to the manufacturer and the manufacturer says i
sustain a business venture during the period of disruption
don't have any products in stock so, this would give you
the more you know, customer dissatisfaction rate and a lot
of other issues because the sales rank might go down
technically speaking, if you're not selling any products more
than three days or if your inventory is zero for more than
three days your sales rank will go down so, the customers will
not be coming to your you know, site for anymore so, the bond
rate and a lot of technical stuffs are there so, this is
the main disadvantage for you know, the drop shipping model
the other disadvantages, for example, if the if the
in digital platform raja rajan is the cfo of boston creative
manufacturer discontinue the product, or he is selling the
different sizes or different colors, and if he's not updated
with his current system, then again, it's a problem so, these
are the disadvantages and advantages in the dropshipping
model but lot of you know the new ecommerce sellers are
preferring this drop shipping model because they don't want to
maintain any stocks so they don't want to invest any money on top
of everything so so, this is the, you know, best thing is
this is a current method currently going on the e
commerce platforms and the regular conventional model is
company, managing director of r bcc export private
it's like are ordering something you are ordering
hundred units from the manufacturer and you are
keeping it with you and you are, you are advertising the product
to the multiple marketplaces, let's say amazon, ebay and your
own websites so, you ship the products whenever you
get an order from these websites, and when you sending
the products to the customers the disadvantages of the
conventional model might be what it happens is, for example,
you're selling in platform abc, and platform a suddenly picks it
up and it's in amazon, you're selling fifty units a day, okay? so
limited he has completed his b tech he started his career as a
you don't, you don't have any idea how much i have to stock it
again for example, if my entire as inventory goes within a two
days, i have to order it again from the manufacturer and the
manufacturer might say, i need at least five to six days to
supply you so and if you take another six days to give it back
and you have to give it to the customers again the same you
know, the, the customer satisfaction might go here and
there and the second time ordering, he's ordering let's
say, okay, i ran out of stock within two days so, let me
order thousands units and i will keep it in stock and worst case
software engineer and as traveled to the united states to
scenario, the sales is not picking up or you know, so the
season might be over by the time so, in that case, he have
thousands stocks, but he is not able to sell thousands units in a
month so he might have a debt stocks around eight hundred nine hundred units and
you know, so they they dosen't assume that is a one product if
he has a five hundred six hundred products so, this model, you know, so that's
what the most of the people are preferring the drop shipping
method rather than the conventional supplying you know
conventional stock keeping methods
dear students, you have got greater inputs from mr raja rajan who had
work with it majors like cognizant and infosys as a
spoken about the different types of supply chains like
dropshipping, regular channels as like any other business thank

over to you
you have a wide range of experience in marketing your
products in amazon and other e commerce sites can you provide
insights on supply chain management in e commerce?
thanks arthi mam, thanks jerinabi, sure! actually the current e commerce
world there are different types of supply chain management is
scintillating interview with a successful business personality
happening right now so one is drop shipping and the second one
is a conventional model that is manufacturer to retailer or
manufacturer to retailer to distributor to retailer the
current trending one is called as a drop shipping it's very
good because they don't maintain any inventory system in their
place for example so, i am selling pro, i am
manufacturing a product called a and you are selling on e
commerce platform and you don't maintain any stocks, what you do
is you just display in the e commerce platforms say that i
sell these many products into website a, and whenever you get
more than theoretical expression to gain subject knowledge
the orders, you directly send the orders to me, i will supply the
products to the customers so, in this model, this drop shipping
model that is no inventory management for the people who's
managing the website so, the other disadvantages of the drop
shipping model is, if i'm running out of stock, the manufacturer
running out of stock and you display the product is available
and the customer is ordering the product and you will be ending
up you know, placing the order to me because i don't have a
store the manufacturer doesn't have a stock and you already
received the order and the customer,
practical exposure is much more important to add to our
dissatisfaction would be height so, the conve the the other method is like
distributor was the retailers this conventional model is still
goes good again we have the same, you know issues something
like the inventory management between the manufacturers versus
the retailer, but it has an advantage they have they will be
connected together and they will be keep getting the updates from
the manufacturer to retailers every days or their systems will
be synced so, these are the two types everybody are using for
the supply chain management purpose the solution for this
dropshipping model and the conventional model there are a
knowledge repository this interview will be loaded with
lot of tools that are available currently in the market that is
called as oberlo and these kind of systems which would help you
to sync the manufacturers inventory versus the retailer's
inventory or whoever is doing the drop shipping model they
are can they are you know, managing the inventory system as
a centralized so, if you own an e commerce platform and you are
selling into three marketplaces, let's say you're selling in
amazon as well as you're selling on ebay and you're selling on
your own websites so whenever an instance if the customer is
there are a lot of customers who's buying the products from
information related to different types of supply chains
you, you are a drop shipper and you are getting the orders are
getting from these three websites, it might be really your
product a might go well in amazon and product b might go
well in ebay and product c might go well in your website so,
these, the person cannot manage all the inventories and
they cannot monitor the systems every day so, what they do is
they connect with a centralized system it's called us there are
a lot of third party software's are available it's one of the
best thing is called as an oberlo so what they do was
they connect all your platforms variable you're selling it so
in e commerce business and the challenges of managing supply
hi students, welcome back to interview on to the interview
and there are a lot of supply chain management solutions out
there but we personally use zohos and oberlo so, the zoho,
what it will do is you it will maintain the entire inventory
management system and it will alert you when, when the trend is
going up and when the trend is going low, when you have to you
know, keep stocking your inventories and when you have to
keep up your packaging materials and there you have to maintain
entire stocks in that system so, the other side the order
management system is also plays a vital role for the supply
chain management, as i said earlier, and you sell it in the
sell the products for example, if you are planning to sell some
multiple platforms and we sell it like almost eight hundred and ten countries,
and we have the stocks in almost ten countries you know, so that's
very hectic task, because we never know which product will
sell in which countries so and based on the seasons for
example, the back to school season, let's say that starts
from in the us it's between july to august and we cannot
blindly stock up all the products because it will just go
between june to july time period you know so, after that nobody is
going to buy the product so we have to plan a call from the
month of april, and we have to stock it up and when we cleared
product you know, so we have to buy the products from the
it out, it's done so, we have to plan next year and we have to
take out all the inventories which is already in the
fulfillment centers, and we have to take back all the stocks and
we have to keep it in our in house if we maintain the stocks
in the fulfillment centers, we have to pay a lot of money for
maintaining our stocks in the system or in their fulfillment
centers, we have to pay a lot of money so, to avoid this, we are
using centralized software's and also the good there are a lot of
software's as i told so for the usa and uk we are using the
godaddy systems, which would absolutely maintain all your
manufacturer and we have to take the product photoshoot and we
inventories and order management's if you are selling
in three platform we are almost selling like amazon, ebay,
walmart and ceos and our own platform there are six eight
season six, seven platforms only for the us alone so, seven
marketplaces on one inventory system, it's very difficult to
maintain it as well as the supply chain from here we are
we are supplying the products from various countries, we are
manufacturing the product from india as well as we are, we are
getting some couple of raw materials from china as well
so, we have to supply those products to those countries on
have to publish into each and every website where we are
the current dates and you know, on the the current quality,
there are in
this kind of things, we are getting some kind of quality
issues as well as i said, we know if if the manufacturer is
running out of the problem product, and we have to check
about the alternate products, what could be, you know,
balanced between that early product and this one so, we
personally believe systems rather than, you know,
maintaining the physical inventories, we do physical
inventories but it's, it's, it's not quite possible if you have a
selling it so in this scenario, the when the supply chain
large number of fulfillment centers and selling it in a
multiple platforms, if you're just selling in one ecommerce
sites, and if you just have one fulfillment center, then it's
fine so you can manage it on its own but if you're going for a
bigger you have to go for software's that was i recommend
personally,
the students who have got greater inputs from mr raja
rajan, who had spoken about the different types of supply chains
like dropshipping, regular channels as like any other
business he mentioned about the chain of operations between
management breaks, you know, so these are the challenges we use
manufacturer retailer, manufacturer to distributor,
distributor to retailer, and also about the challenges like
quality issues on time supply of raw materials, business-
environmental changes, improper inventory management, etc in in
e commerce business we discuss about the role of supply chains
in effective e commerce business operations thank you students
let's meet again
to really face it for example, we are getting some glitter
papers from china so when we get the glitter papers on the
first time and we get it like a pure gold color, and we we
create the product and we take the photoshoot of the product
now
and we display it enough all our websites and we had we bought
at like one thousand sheets something like that so we bought it and
we almost sold all the products on the, on the particular
timeframe and when we get so when we are when we are about to
get out of stock and when we plan to place an order second
time the manufacturer says we stopped selling the gold plated
papers so, we are stuck there you know so, because we have
spent a lot of money on taking the product photo shoot and
uploading in the ecommerce websites as well as we take a
lot of ads and we spend on on a lot of advertisements and load
thank you raja rajan it was very interesting when you discussed
and a lot of things so, when the manufacturer stops the
supplies and we you know these money are rolled out so, so we
have to find the products so then we are conscious whenever
we get the products with the error free supply chain issues
so when we select those kind of products accordingly and we are
you know, we are selling those products in the e commerce
platforms so this is the main challenge we usually face and
there are a lot of additional problems also there for example
from january to october, okay, so the when i say the peak season
would be for the usa and we are selling in the usa and uk
about the models and now each commerce
customers, our peak season would be on a christmas season that's
like starts from november to december timeframe in the
timeframes for the resellers i'm talking about so for example,
so if you are selling the christmas decorations, right, so
when we are selling the christmas decorations, we should
place an order on or before june july, because when we just come
to october and when we place the christmas decoration products to
the supplier, and they say sorry, everybody are asking
decorations on the same date, we have a limited resources here
and we don't have a capability of manufacturing the products in
business but in general
higher numbers so, that time we struck, so we have to plan the
inventory system very properly, and we have to place an order on
or before the christmas season starts and there are a lot of
other issues also there let's say an amazon fulfillment so,
for example, even if we have a stocks and be sent to the
fulfillment centers, and what they say is we have we have a
lot of products are coming in our inventory system? so, we have
certain delays so that's a big challenge you know so when we
are selling good like say one hundred two hundred units a day when
fulfillment center saying that we cannot take the inventory
irrespective of whether you use a drop shipment model or a
furthermore, and we are struck whatever the in whatever the
money we have invested for the stocks, it's dead so; after
christmas, nobody's going to buy the christmas decorations, right
so this is a you know, major challenges on the supply chain
management
thank you raja rajan for sharing your experiences on ecommerce
supply chain models and challenges can you say the
supply chain solutions in e commerce business? yes, of
course
so, as we evolve more if you're, if you have a limited number of
traditional model, what are the challenges that you have faced
products, you don't want to go for software's, but you don't so
when we sell five hundred or six hundred products, different type of
products we have, definitely we have to go for software
solutions there are a lot of solutions there are solutions
there are a lot of solutions available in the market, but we
personally go for high solutions like zoho, or oberlo kind of
recognized software's so, we personally use zoho inventory
the reason we ,we go for zoho is it's, it's straightforward and
it's pretty simple and neat so, since we are a manufacturer, and
we sell a couple of reselling, we do a couple of reselling
in a supply chain when it comes to e commerce or e business
products as a manufacturer, we have we are producing more than
four hundred to five hundred products worldwide and we have a lot of more than
eight hundred to nine hundred raw materials, we have to keep it in stock,
including packaging materials, including you know, raw
materials, no, the supplies like a printings and a lot of
supplies, cnc needles, kind of etc etc when we tell
about supply chain management, we are you know, we i have to
tell about two things one is order management as well as the
inventory management that is supply chain management so when
i say the supply chain management, we have to make
sure ma'am of course so,
sense we are the manufacturer, we have to maintain more than
one thousand, two hundred raw materials, which includes from small products
from thread to needles and packing supplies and inks,
printer rings, needles and laser supplies and kind of learn a lot
of products so, if we miss some products, okay, let's say we
created the product and we have to suppose to send the inventory
to the fulfillment center today, and we are running out of
packaging materials and we are stuck on the day you know, for
the simple things we, we lose hundreds of dollars every day
so for this kind of things, we go for our solutions like zoho
as a ecommerce seller, we have to do certain steps before we
hi students, welcome back to interview in the previous
do is we will split it into three hundred three hundred to three hundred to each suppliers
and we will get it done and from my point of view as a
manufacturer, what i do is i will select the product very
particularly whatever it shouldn't be any rare products
let's say if we do a lot of wooden products as well so and i
would personally see that, that wooden supplies are error free
so that means we shouldn't be running out of stock it may not
be seasonal product let's say some wooden products or some you
know some woods are seasonal so it will we will get it on that
particular season alone so i will not select those products
website, when you sell a product in an e commerce website as a
even though if it sells good, i would not select the products, it
should be round the clock that should be available between three hundred and sixty-five
days and i will select the packaging things and everything
should be in a three hundred and sixty-five day man and that means that means that i
shouldn't run out of raw materials at any time you know
and for as i said i as the personally take care of the
multi vendor system and the raw materials and the packaging
supplies and everything is like hassle free then you can it
we'll be like, you know, running the clock so otherwise, when
you go for larger inventories, you might face a problem on the
consumer, many times we send back the goods because we are
scenarios
thankyou raja rajan, i think it's quite interesting to note the
reverse logistics management of your practice so it's again, we
are
putting all the burden only on the consumer
okay one thing i would like to know, when the
consumer returned the products due to
the satisfaction or any reason are you refunding the money or
keeping the money and their credits again, if you are not
refunding the money, you are keeping that money and the
not happy or even sometimes it is a false representation i
credit again, the interest for those days
again, the refunds are a very interesting part because as you
said, yes as you know, business person we have to consider how
many days we hold the money and everything because every day the
money counts for managing the refunds actually as per our
company policies, we have a thirty days of return policies so in
us but in india the scenarios are totally different but in
when they talk to usa and uk clients, so the refunds we have
the policies for any reasons we even we print it on our
packaging says that for any reasons if you're not satisfied
will say i get paid the price for the product when the good
or the quality is not up to your mark or anything, you know, so
we will just refund the money without no questions asked let
me tell you an interesting scenario on the refund okay we
have, there are i will not say all the customers i would say
just one percent or less than one percent of there are fake customers also let's
say let's take in scenario we manufacture a lot of party
supply products and we sell it through a lot of countries and
we we usually get this kind of scenario for example, they order
a birthday party supplies okay, we will send them , happy
birthday banners or garland's or whatever, right? so what the
reaches home, but i do not have money that day and the products
customer usually not usually, but no one of other so what
they do is, they celebrate the birthday party without supplies
and the next day after the party they say, you know, the quality
is not up to the mark or we are not celebrating the party due to
some reasons and the package has arrived very late after my
birthday so, so and so reasons right so we usually you know,
so but it's considered as a less than one percentage so, we
usually refund the money for them and there are so when we
have a problem in those scenarios, the custom made
products, let's say if i want to print your name on the pin or
are going back or i'm not at home the products are going back
any custom products, you know, so if if we make a pin
personalized pin for you and we are shipping to you, and the
customer says that, no, my boss went and we bought a different
gift and you have to take the product back so, what we will do to
the product which already have a name on it, right, you have to
consider that point also so, yes, but as per our company
policies, we take it that as a negative account, as a loss
account and we take that amount into our consideration so, but
there are a lot of other companies and you know, they
they personally do not take any custom orders or they do not
and suppose the product is not good again so there's a lot of
take refunds on the custom orders and there are a lot of
written policies involved
yeah, this is all about the returns and refunds
dear students, as you all have experienced hearing mr raja
rajan, it is now imperative to recap his contributions he has
given impetus on managing sales trend, customer satisfaction
through quick rich, seasonal impact, multi vendor system,
issues that fulfillment center challenges of reverse logistics,
gaining competitive knowledge through effective usage of
supply chains and finally achieving customer delight
reverse logistics issues there's so do you face such
may i take this opportunity to thank mr raja rajan for sparing his time and
all academicians who have join this panel thank you all very much
thank you dear students, thank you so much thank you for, so
much
for this opportunity and answering your, all your
questions
thanks again
issues in your supply chain on
so yes, of course actually let me take your real time scenario
interview with mr raja rajan, we focused on two aspects of
what we are doing it, okay so, to be frank, we start
selling our products in india and the written ratio let's take
in written ratio we almost get thirty percent of the problem products
have been returned when we sell the same products what we sell
in usa when we start selling in india we almost get
thirty percent of the products have been reached, no refund did that
means the customer is not satisfied with the product and
we have a lot of logistics issues say let's, let's say when
customers have said that my friend birthday was on tomorrow,
but your product has been delivered day after that, you
different types of supply chain and the various challenges
know so, in those cases, we have to take it back and you
know, there are people sitting in noida and they are expecting
the product to be delivered on the same day it may not be
possible, you know, so there are a lot of understanding issues as
well, as well as their logistic issues and probably no it may
not meet their expectations as well in these cases so we have
stopped selling the products in india and for the us sides yes,
we do have a lot of these challenges and stuff but what i
say is it's ultimately be like one person i would say, if we
sell hundred products that would be one product has been
related to supply chain management in e commerce
returned and what we consider and most of you know, the brand
owners or the manufacturers, let's say they usually markup
that price, the written products, price in the product for
example, if i'm selling thousand products and there are ten
products have been returned the what is the cost of the return
product, let's say it's a, it's $100 okay, so we add this
hundred dollars in thousand products, let's say we add ten
cents in each of the products that's all the brand does so,
even i when i work with a lot of my clients, it's like nike,
vicoria secrets and everybody so they do the same so we add what
business now we will elicit more information about the
is the orders the total returns and we add the price, we add the
market prices with the retail price so when we, we expect that
it's it's you know, we cannot satisfy all the customers even
apple has a lot of return customers and a lot of
dissatisfied customers so, we accept that as a part of e
commerce platforms so, but most of the thing we personally make
sure, we try to avoid the returns as much as possible but yes,
there might be a one to five percentage we take it as
returns
can you share one or two scenarios way supply chain
importance of supply chains in the successful functioning of
solutions help you to effectively carry out business?
to answer your question, you know, let me explain the live
scenarios what we are doing in our companies, you know the
systems we have to fit the human errors, i would say the human
errors, there are scenarios who comes as a freshers and you
know, they really don't have any idea about let's say father's
day, okay, so if fathers we produce a lot of products for
the father's day and when we are trying to sell it on that
season, and the person who come as a fresher okay, so they
feed the system, how many units we are selling on that
the business in e commerce platform on to the interview now
particular month for example in the father's day falls on june
okay so, if the person is joining on march or april and
see there is a big peak on some products and what he usually
does he we face the same scenario okay so what he have
identified as so these products are selling more and he expect
the same amount of products would sell on the respective
months so, he has alerted the suppliers and saying that so we
need this much of products for the next couple of months, you
know, then, so we don't have any idea because we have a lot of
products and stocks and you know, so we never know what the
thank you raja rajan maybe you have been talking about
humans are doing because we cannot monitor each and
everybody so, the persons are already alerted the system so
he placed in n number of products during rest of the
pharmacies time you know, so we got a lot of units and we have
to keep it in stock and we have to sell it in that kind of
system so other things, i would say the multimeter system, so
multi window system like for example, if we are i, this is my
personal opinion so i usually don't depend on a single vendor
so, for example if you are getting this pro if you're
getting a product from the supplier again, i usually try to
the
get supplier b and supplier c and we usually place order in a
circular basis so, when, when the january month, we place an order
to a and february to b and we'll match to c so in this scenario
and we will be touched with all the people and whenever we
supply a runs out of stock and we will get it from the b and
when the beans are not stock and we'll get from c and we'll get
it from both of them so, for the christmas seasons and you know
holiday peak seasons we usually get so if you order one thousand units
to supply a and he would say the everybody is asking thousand
units and i cannot produce that much of quantity and what we'll
software for your internal supply chain but in e commerce
dear learners, welcome you all to the module on information
application software, robotics, business intelligence, data
analytics sensors and similar technologies allow seamless
coordination of information internally for enhancing
efficiency of the supply chain now finally, it applications for
external supply information technologies enable
uninterrupted and seamless connectivity with the suppliers
spread across geographical locations technologies such as
electronic data interchange, enterprise resource planning,
hypertext markup language, extensible markup language,
vendor managed inventory, and web enabled portals enables real
supply chain, comprehend the application of it in supply
time information sharing with the suppliers, which improves
transparency and reduce cost of transactions now having seen the
significance of information in various demand and supply so,
let us now move on to the benefits of it in supply chain
management supply chain management in spite of its
complexity and shows competitive advantage to the organization
information technology, when used appropriately can minimize
the complexities in the supply chain processes and operations
and contribute to quantifiable benefits to the organization
below listed are the top benefits for an organization due
chain processes and operations and understand the components
to it applications in its supply chain activities they are
reduced operating costs through efficient management of
resources, improved efficiency with real time communication and
joint decision making reduced shortages and delays in supply
chain processes through integration and collaboration,
increased supply chain profitability in specific and
business profitability in general enhanced supply chain network
through collaborations with all states to conclude
information technology in supply chain management would bring in
radical transformation and changes for excellence of any
and its applications of digital supply chain in the first
organization results of it implementation in supply chain
management cannot be seen overnight further, the outcomes
might vary based on the way it is implemented therefore, right
use of information technology in supply chain management combined
with clear vision and implementation will enable the
organizations to be futuristic and sustainable dear learners,
in the next module, we will discuss about the concept of
digital supply chains, along with its benefits, components
and challenges
thank you happy learning
video, we will focus on it and it's role in supply chain
management now moving to the introduction part every business
however large or small comprises a supply chain network supply
chain includes a complex network of suppliers, manufacturers,
distributors, retailers, logistics and warehouse
providers and customers supply chain is responsible for smooth
flow of products, money and information within and amongst
technology in supply chain i will be presenting this module
various supply chain partners here comes the role of
information technology, which has drastically changed the way
in which businesses are carried out supply chain being an
interconnected structure, by its very nature is highly dependent
on it for sharing and processing of information
across various stages
it has been utilized in various functions of supply chain in the
past three decades in various activities it ensures supply
chains to be agile and efficient by ensuring transparency,
automation and faster communication with greater
in three video lessons the learning objectives of this
accuracy and lesser defects coordination of various
activities across various stages is possible only through it
supply chain functions have been greatly impacted by it and its
advances due to the following reasons number one, customer
satisfaction has become a topmost priority of all
businesses and increasing competitive pressures
information has become a crucial factor in reducing manpower at
inventory level also information plays a vital role
in strategic planning and in deployment of resources in the
organization now, moving on to objectives of it in supply chain
module are to understand the role played by it in supply
management, the following are the objectives for implementing
it in supply chain management as given by sentry levy at all, in
two thousand and three they are providing information availability and
visibility ,enabling a single point of contact of data,
allowing decisions based on total supply chain information and
enabling collaboration but supply chain path now, let us
discuss the functional role played by it in supply chain
management it can be broadly classified in three categories
the first one being transaction execution firstly, it supports
all transaction execution related activities so that they
chain, discuss various technologies used in demand and
are perform smoothly and with greater accuracy transaction
execution includes it applications to improve the
efficiency of all respective data add to enhance information
sharing amongst the supply chain states examples for transaction
processing include order processing, failing generating
codes, dispatch related details and delivery verification the
second one does planning, collaboration and coordination
it is used in scm, planning, coordination and collaborative
activities this includes sharing of information related
to demand, inventory, production capacity with the channel
supply integration and to introduce the concept of digital
partners so that joint mission making is possible order and
shipment tracking is possible through coordination among
partners, enterprise resource planning, collaborative
planning, forecasting and replenishment, and vendor
managed inventory these are few technologies that provide scope
for collaborative planning among channel path the last one
is patient it is used for decisison making in supply chain
real time data capturing and sharing has enabled greater
visibility, agility, and real time decision making using
artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analysis and
supply chain along with its
predictive analytics tools such as real time sharing of
information helps in reducing delays to a greater extent and
it improves accuracy also, let us now discuss the role played
by it in demand and supply side activities of supply chain it
supports and enhances the demand and supply side activities in a
supply chain coordination becomes much simpler, effective
and reliable with the use of it in demand supply configuration
let us discuss briefly the various technologies involved in
such integration now, moving on to the it for external demand
this includes technologies involved in capturing the demand
components
data from the end customer this includes technologies such as
pos data, that is point of sales data rfid barcoding online
customer search data and alike if customer demand data is
rightly captured and the same is shared, without any
distortion like bullwhip effect, then the manufacturer would be
able to match the supplies efficiently the next one is it
for internal demand, the customer demand data collected
through various sources stays with the marketing department of
any organization appropriate technologies are needed to
integrate the entire demand data and organize the same according
moving on to learning outcomes at the end of the session,
to various criteria such as priorities for product types,
shelf life, customer preferences and alike these technologies
would be helpful for planning and forecasting demand with
greater accuracy it for internal supply the amount of
information being very huge nowadays ,there arises the need
for coordination of information within the company's internal
departments information technologies play a vital role
in coordinating information across sourcing, production,
inventory, distribution, sales, logistics, and finance
functions technologies such as internet, emails,sms, various
learners would be able to appreciate the need for it in
dear learners,
into smart and valuable infrastructure the last one is
supply chain analytics supply chain analytics improves
operational efficiency of supply chains through data driven
decisions at strategic, operational and tactical levels
examples include identification of most efficient shipping
carrier, determination of right safety stock levels, customized
demand forecasting and inventory planning, controlling critical
process parameters and much more supply chain optimization
becomes easier with the application of supply chain
analytics now, having seen the benefits and elements of digital
four zero supply chains need to move towards a connected ,smart and
supply chain let us also look into some of the challenges
faced in transforming towards digital supply chain, lack of
preparation and understanding that is, organizations still
have not developed digital maturity they're able to
understand various technologies and its applications
organizations need to have a clear vision and mission towards
supply chain transformation in order to be successful the next
challenge would be lack of resources, organizations lack
resources in terms of technology, infrastructure,
manpower, materials, and funds for implementing digital supply
highly efficient systems for gaining competitive advantage
chain in total
lack of collaborative culture
organizations have remained isolated till date without much
collaboration with channel partners today's customers are
highly demanding and seek transparency and visibility of
the supply chains collaborative culture among channel partners
enables value addition and enhances profitability of the
entire supply chain the final challenge would be lack of
knowledge on risk management digital supply chains are prone
to cyber attacks and organizations lack awareness on
over others what exactly is a digital supply chain? the term
data protection and privacy therefore, it becomes imperative
for organizations to understand the types of cyber risk and
ways and means to protect private data to conclude, digital supply
chains enable organizations to lead forward with data driven
decisions and usage of right technologies in all supply chain
processes it enables seamless connectivity with all its
channel partners on a real time basis, thereby providing high
levels of transparency in the supply chain digital technology
enablers such as ai, internet of things, sensors, robotics,
drones, nanotechnology, three d printing, cloud services, and
digital supply chain may refer to management of digital aspects
geo locations have made supply chains more agile, responsive
and futuristic
disruptive technologies
often bring in new challenges and risk to the business such as
cyber attacks and theft of data
hence,
businesses have to simultaneously monitor and
develop risk mitigation strategies
while going digital
organizations need to develop well defined digital supply
of a physical supply chain, or management of delivery of
chain strategies and invest on right technologies to remind
competitive and sustain in the fast paced digital era dear
learners ,in the next video, we will discuss your real time case
to understand the role of it in enhancing supply chain
operations thank you happy learning
digital products supply chain in this lesson, we'll be
discussing the concept of digital supply chain referring
to managing the digital aspects of supply chain according to
tony hines two thousand and one digital supply chains are configured to
distribute goods or services that have previously been
we had discussed about the significance of it in supply
supplied in physical form typical examples include books, music,
and films however, hines included business to business services,
like fashion design and product development that were made
digitally such digitization, removes time, distance and cost,
thereby enhancing value to the supply chain therefore, digital
supply chains looks at ways and means of improving efficiency
and profitability of the supply chain according to a mckinsey
report on next generation digital supply chains, the
supply chain leaders ought to place sensors and everything
create networks everywhere automate anything and analyze
chain in the previous video in this video, we will discuss
everything to significantly improve performance and customer
satisfaction what constitutes a digital supply chain management?
digital supply chain management can be seen as the usual supply
chain management guided and managed by advanced digital
technologies such as internet of things, blockchain, machine
learning, artificial intelligence, predictive
analytics, robotics and alike the goal of digital supply chain
is to build a supply chain network which is resilient and
responsible now, moving on to advantages of digital supply
chain over traditional supply chain

organizations to contribute towards the vision of industry
dear learners in continuation of the previous lesson,
supply chain organizations link the customer and the supply
chain operations to provide differentiating products,
services and delivery processes for different segments of customers
demand chain management integrates all the
activities across the demand chain, starting from the
delivery and the service to the end customer through the coordination of
raw material suppliers demand chain management involves four
phases namely demand and supply process integration, digital
integration, configuring the value system and cross
functional working relationships with this brief
in this session we will continue to understand what is demand
explanation on demand chain management, let us move on to
understand the integration of demand and supply processes
rainbird suggests the process fusion model for demand and
supply process integration and this model helps to understand
the relationship between demand and supply processes
across the customer life cycle the three layers of the model stress,
first, the integration of customer into the value chain process
second, the conceptualization of dynamic thing,
customer relationships and third links the activities in
the demand processes with those in the supply process
management and how to integrate demand management functions,
the integration of demand processes and supply chain processes is
explained as follows: the marketing managers on monitoring
the supply networks gain information from the market analysis
this helps organizations to understand
the new products and services in the market the expectations of the
customers in terms of products services and delivery
the supply network provides inputs on customer behavior,
retail preferences and technology preferences this inputs help
demand managers in segmenting and targeting the right customer segments
at the evaluation stage, the consumers compare
supply chain processes and customer lifecycle demand chain
various products and services across various features and
functions of the product or brand for example, if the
product is car, they compare the brands of cars based on mileage
grip, engine type and power, space and services capturing data
at the evaluation phase from the customers will help the
marketers to carry out the following demand and supply processes:
forecasting the demand, segmenting the market based on
needs, preferences and profitability, designing supply
networks, proposing delivery and service packages
in the third phase of customer lifecycle the decision to purchase is taken
management, integrating, marketing and supply chain management
the decision to purchase by the consumer is supported by the
demand processes of defining the value proposition of the product
and service features to a specified customer and by
carrying out the supply process of receiving orders and order fulfillment
the purchase of the products or services is
integrated with the demand processes of transactional processing,
delivery and the supply process of physical distribution of products
the last phase in the customer buying is consumption of the products
the information flow regarding consumption helps the marketers to design demand
management processes to improve customer service, sell more of
demand chain management aims to create value to the customers by
the same product to this customer that is upselling,
sell related products to the same customer that is cross selling
the information and interaction with the customers at this stage
also helps to revise the supply chain processes of physical
distribution and service package offerings
this is well presented in the infusion model by rainbird as follows:
thank you and welcome you all to the next session on

expenses by fifty percent technology-the game changer for avaya avaya's
success is no doubt due to rapid transformation in its supply
chain operations with right technologies in place avaya
adopted a: long-term, phased approach to standardize its
supply chain processes, initiated cultural change,
invested in the best human resources and practiced rigorous
benchmarking and kpi tracking the company migrated almost all
its business processes onto a cloud platform called "rapid
response" which is a product of kinaxis it now uses the cloud
based solution for
its headquarters at santa clara, california avaya is a market
supplier communication,
supply planning, demand planning, inventory planning,
inbound and outbound logistics planning, procurement spend
analysis, and point of sale analytics dear learners to
conclude
the above case,
lucidly presented avaya's transformation from worst-in-class
to best-in-class supply chain with clear vision for
people, process
and technology
leader in communication software and it specializes in
organizations need to embrace technology and be proactive
like avaya
in making its supply chain
efficient, agile and sustainable thank you happy
learning!
unified communications, contact centre, services and
devices
it has a
long legacy of open source innovation from at&t to lucent
to avaya
it serves about ninety percent
of fortune five hundred companies with about two hundred and twenty thousand customers
worldwide it has made more than fifteen acquisitions since two thousand and one
enabled supply chain transformation in the last two
including nortal enterprise solutions,radvision, hp and
more
avaya success is greatly accountable
to its
supply chain transformation and customer
satisfaction
moving on to problems faced by avaya
during two thousand and eight - two thousand and nine
the company
faced many hurdles
lessons you have learnt about digital supply chain and
way back in two thousand and eight - nine
it had the worst-in-class
supply chain in two thousand and eight the supply chain was highly
unreliable and it had very poor relationship with some contract
manufacturers supplier terms and conditions were imbalanced
their supply chain was inflexible, inefficient and
totally manual
so, avaya
suffered from higher inventories,
and long cash-to-cash cycle now what was the challenge
applications of it in various supply chain processes and
faced by avaya? the company had
made multiple corporate acquisitions which includes
nortal enterprise solutions, radvision, and hp after
acquiring nortal enterprise solutions in two thousand and nine avaya found its
supply chain unstable and ineffective
it had many redundant
processes and multiple it solutions but
it suffered from
a holistic view of its entire supply chain network the
transformation path at avaya the company started realizing
activities in this video lesson we will discuss a real
its mistakes and began to change for good
the transformation took place
over a period of four years
from two thousand and ten to fourteen
the transformation began with a new leadership heading supply
chain operations with emphasis on supply chain collaborations
and integration
avaya
moved to cloud platform which was totally immature at that time
it brought in reforms in its sourcing
time case of a company that had drastic transformation in supply
by consolidating among broad suppliers and limited to few
reliable vendors
and it developed
better relationships with those few vendors avaya's supply chain
team had simultaneously built an (sales and operations planning)
team to improve communications
across the company with the help of
rapid-response tools and initiatives it shifted its
working model to on-demand planning process through real
time communications between sales and its supply base the
chain operations
company also had practiced vendor managed inventory and it
created distributor predictive model to identify over stocking
and under stocking of sku
transportation 'sandbox' allowed
suppliers to model changes in freight method
further,
non-value adding work were identified and automated avaya
also improved its forecasting abilities through product
lifecycle monitoring, real time inventory data
and with
through
customer relationship management data
it also improved its collaboration with sales and
finance department
finally,
it worked on improving its dashboards and
web portals with focus on accuracy and connectivity with
all stakeholders outcomes
of the transformation at avaya
the efforts
taken up by avaya
careful planning and implementation of it avaya is
have brought best-in-class benchmarks to the company by
two thousand and seventeen presently, avaya is exceeding industry benchmarks in
eleven key metrics it has reduced its working capital tied in
inventory by ninety-four percent simultaneously, it has seen
two hundred and twenty-four percent improvement in inventory turnover and has achieved on-
time shipments by ninety-seven percent further supply chain visibility of the
company has improved drastically it has also reduced
air freight by seventy-five %,
inventory has reduced by eighty-five percent
and on the whole avaya was able to reduce its supply chain

dear learners! business intelligence and analytics are the buzzwords in
chain analytics and thinking supply chain by the end of the
session, the learners will be able to appreciate the
application of supply chain analytics for information-driven
supply chains and identify supply chain processes that can
use supply chain analytics now, let us move on to the first
lesson on concepts and components of business
analytics business analytics, the data-driven analysis of
business processes is an activity wherein big data is
mined to enhance business intelligence the three
important aspects of business analytics are: business
all strategic areas across all industries business analytics
intelligence, big data and data warehouses, data mining and
business analytics business intelligence consists of data
analysis intending to uncover the hidden patterns and trends
to gain insights into the future bi is a technology-
driven process for: organizing internal and external data,
preparing queries, creating reports, dashboards, data
visualization, and analytical results to support strategic and
operational decisions some noteworthy bi tools are: sap
analytics, yellowfin, tableau, power bi and sisense the open-source
bi tools are: redash, metabase, google data studio, google sheets,
referred to as knowledge discovery in databases started
and apache zeppelin big data consists of huge data and data
handling architecture that is data warehouse, data modelling
languages and programs, online analytical processing, and data
cubes that process, store, and facilitate data analysis the
data warehouse is a collection of databases that are subject-
oriented, integrated, time-variant, and non-volatile olap is a
component of big data handling architecture that consists of
relational databases, data mining, and reporting mechanisms
to answer multi-dimensional analytical queries data
warehouses and olap tools are based on a multidimensional data
as data mining and moved to big data analytics the module on
cube defined by dimensions that is (entities) and facts for which
the organization maintains records data mining and
business analytics data mining discovers hidden knowledge,
meaningful patterns and new rules using data mining
algorithms and data analytics data analytics uses statistical
techniques and big data to identify patterns and
correlations while business analytics uses big data tools to
support business decisions by analyzing the effectiveness of
procedures and other metrics to growth the relationship between
data mining and business intelligence is that of a cause
supply chain analytics covers three lessons: business
and effect the cause is about what of a database and the
effect is about how and why
in supply chain analytics, business intelligence, big data,
and data mining all work together to provide solutions
for responsiveness, agility, and productivity
supply chain analytics focuses on making sense to the data by
uncovering patterns and generating insights from the
data collected across the supply chain activities
the different types of supply chain analytics are: descriptive
analytics that presents the what of a supply chain and the
analytics concepts and components, supply chain
performance as dashboards and reports diagnostic analytics
identify the why and how of the supply chain performance through
root cause analysis (rca), online analytical processing (olap), and
what-if analytics
predictive analytics is to for see the most likely outcomes
and future supply chain scenarios and their
implications prescriptive analytics solve business
problems and help collaboration with supply chain partners,
optimization and integration of disruptions
cognitive analytics solves complex supply chain problems
analytics portfolio and characteristics, supply chain
like a human being with high speed and accuracy by applying
cognitive techniques like artificial intelligence in
short, supply chain analytics is a data-driven technology wherein
big data is mined to enhance business performance
bernard marr in his book "big data" says "the world is getting
smarter the marriage between data and technology is
radically changing the world and making it smarter and smarter
businesses became smarter and companies that do not enhance
the smart revolution will be left behind "
the technology embedded smart model of business indicates
analytics olap operations the learning objectives of this
start with strategy, measure metrics and data, apply
analytics, report results and transform business this
indicates supply chains are smart they embrace technology
that measures metrics and data, apply analytics and report
results to transform supply chain strategy for business

and it is a collection of databases that are: subject oriented,
integrated, time-variant and non-volatile
data warehouses and olap tools are based on multi dimensional data
model called data cube, or data cube is defined by dimensions and facts
dimensions are the perspectives or entities across which the records are maintained
an example is a four - dimensional data cube for sales
with dimensions time,item, location and supplier
each cuboid represents a different degree of summarization
first dimension represents time, item location and supplier
two d represents a combination of two dimensions,
dear learners, online analytical processing,
three d represents a combination of three dimensions,
and four d represents all dimensions
a data warehouse, however, requires a concise,
subject oriented scheme that can facilitateonline data analysis
and the example of data scheme for olap with dimensions is as follows
music
the typical olap operations for multi dimensional data
can be described and illustrated as follows
imagine that there are four retail partners in your supply chain
who sell your various products
referred to as olap is a data analytic tool to answer multi dimensional queries
the central cube in your data warehouse
contain data in dimensions, retailer, time and item
where a retailer is aggregated to retailer value
time is aggregated to quarters
and the item is aggregated to itemtype
the measure displayed is sales value in thousands
the various olap operations that you can perform are as follows
roll up:the roll up operations
also called the drill-up operation performs aggregation on a data cube
by climbing up a concept hierarchy
in diagnostic analytics,
for operations performed on the central cube for example,
consider a sales data cube containing only two dimensions retailer and time
roll-up may be performed by removing the time dimension,
resulting in an aggregation of total sales to retailer
supply_chain_management_3438
drill down, it navigates to a detail the data
by either stepping down a concept hierarchy
or a dimension or introducing additional dimensions
for example, dilton occurs by descending the time hierarchy
from the quarter to a more detailed level of a month
the olap tools are used for data visualization
the resulting data cube details the total sales per month
rather than summarizing them by quarters
slice and dice: a slice operation
where the sales are selected from the central cube for the dimension time,
using the criterion time is equal to q one
supply_chain_management_3450
pivot:pivot or rotate is a visualization
operationthat rotates the data axis
in view to provide an alternative presentation of the data
some olap systems offer drilling operations like drill across executes,
and data mining of multi dimensional data cubes
queries involving more than one fact table
drill through operation uses a relational sql facilities
to drill through the bottom level of the data cube
down to its back-end relational tables
and ranking the top in or bottom in items olap offers
analytical modeling capabilities including
our calculation engine, for deriving ratios, variances and so on,
and computing measures across multi dimensions
and at every dimension intersection
olap also supports function models for forecasting,
in this lesson, we will discuss the olap operations
trend analysis and statistical analysis
visibility do into in supply chain
is something that every production planner and logistics manager wants
an olap engine is a powerful data analysis tool
for supply chain management thank you and an exercise for you all
there are five suppliers who sell your products
that is item a, b, c, d and e
the central cube in your data warehouse contains data in dimensions supplier,
time and item, where a supplier is aggregated to supplier code,
time is aggregated for quarter and the item is aggregated to the item type
from the supply chain management perspective
the measure displayed is sales value in thousands
what will be the olap operation that will answer the following queries
what is the value of procurement from this supplier?
what is the value of procurement month-wise?
what is the value of items procured in q 1?

in prescriptive analytics it makes complex time
sensitive decisionsand descriptive analytics
summarizing business results happen
,what do predictive analytics do?
,predictive analytics are expected to
improve the competitive advantage, to minimize cost and risk,
to increase production and operational efficiency,
to advance safety and complaints, <
to fulfill customer's requirement
and to process data instantly
you will be able to appreciate the claims of predictive analytics
,there are many real life examples
where predictive analytics is used
,the common things are healthcare providers,
governments and public sector, insurance companies,
manufacturers, media and entertainment, utility companies,
credit card, banking and financial services,
telecommunication companies and supply chain management
,what can you do with predictive analytics?
,the points to note that
the first one is the deep knowledge on customer behavior
in supply chain management network,
predictive analytics are used to study
customer responses or purchases,
the purchase behavior patterns etc
predictive models help a business to attract retain
and grow the most profitable customers
the next is improving the performance
it empowers analysts to make strategic decisions
to improve the overall performance
predictive models are used to forecast inventory and manage resources
the next one is reducing the risk
you will promote the profit of supply chain management system
by studying the customer's credit payment pattern,
credit score determining the person's creditworthiness is calculated
the next one is the fraud detection
by identifying the malicious activity well in advance,
any loss of data or money may be avoided
,the list of benefits the predictive analytics provide are
it provides improved collaboration and control,
improved identity insights and relationship insights,
able to aggregate and correlate information,
realities workloads for more profit,
using predictive analytics what is predictive analytics?
catches suspicious trends before loss occurs,
optimized processes and performance and it detects patterns to initiate action
dear learners, in this lesson, we have seen the introduction
for a predictive analytics in the next lesson we will be
continuing with the models and the algorithms used in
predictive analytics happy learning
in all business sectors nowadays,
there is a common prevailing scenario ofpeer competitors,
uncertain market conditions and so on
here predictive models are applied to analyze the patterns
in the existing transactional and historical data
for forecasting the future with a certain degree of accuracy
dear learners, i welcome you all
in other words, predictive analytics embraces
a variety of statistical techniques from data mining,
predictive modeling, machine learning,artificial intelligence,
deep learning algorithms that use the historical and current data
to make the predictions on the forthcoming or unknown events
building the predictive analytics model helps to assess
the risksand to make the right decisions
to improve the overall profit of the system
predictive analytics finds its application in various sectors namely
healthcare, marketing, insurance, telecommunications,
to learn the module titled predictive analytics in supply chain management
retail, travel, financial services, etc
why does predictive analytics matter?
three main things to know here are the first one is
big data on the rise predictive analytics concept
finds its close association with big data
that is enormous data flowing from sensors,
other instruments and connected systems in the real world
on contrary, the company's business data might include
transaction data, sales data, customer data,
marketing information, etc increasingly,businesses are
the objectives of this module is to let you understand
expected to make data driven decisions and predictions in stipulated time
the second point is,the growing competition
as the peer competition increases,
companies need to establish and prove the
quality and standard of the products besides improving theirprofit too
here predictive models which are driven by data
come to the rescue to solve business problems
the third point is the front end technologies
to deal with big data tools such as hadoop and spark which are commonly used
hear data arrives from heterogeneous sources
the need and use of predictive analytics to
in variety,at high speed that is velocity
and in high amount, which is the volume
with such large data, tools are necessary to derive
intelligent information using clear understanding and analysis of data
machine learning techniques including
neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees,
linear and nonlinear regression, and other classification,
clustering and prediction algorithms extend a helping hand here
now we'll see the predictive analysisprocess
the predictive analytics process comprises of the following steps
delineate the uses, applications and advantages of predictive analytics
the first one is defining the project
here the project's objectives,
scope, data set usedand expected outcomes are stated
the second is data collection
the data is collected from the hetrogenous sources
the third one is data analysis here data is analyzed
in the form of data examination, cleaning
and modeling data with a motive of deriving useful information
the fourth one is statistical analysis
statistical models are applied to validate the
to promote the application of predictive analytics
assumptions and hypothesis fixed already
the fifth one is the modeling
here predictive models are created using suitable machine learning algorithms
the sixth one is deployment
designed a model is test run to get results and reports
which are the automated outcome of the decision based modeling process
the seventh and last step is the monitoring
here the performance of the model is surveyed to ensure
that it is providing the expected results
, actually in the face, the business analytics phases, there are three
in supply chain management at the end of this module,
phases totally, which are the predictive analytics,
prescriptive analytics and descriptive analytics
,among this, the descriptive analytics
is put in the first place predictive analytics
finds the position in second
the third one is the prescriptive analytics
, what do you mean by this?
the first one to ask the right question,
on par with the descriptive analytics we will be asking what happened and why?
, the same thing for predictive analytics,
you will gain knowledge on predictive analytics
we will interpret as what will happen?
the same thing for prescriptive analytics,
we will take us what should be done?
the tools and methodologies used for predictive analytics
here arestatistical modeling and simulation
for prescriptive analytics,we use heuristics
and optimization models for descriptive analytics,
we use data aggregation and mining
,the applications are in predictive analytics
it makes conversant decisions about future
applications in various sectors
supply_chain_management_3634
by deriving inferences from input values, that is the training data

the first one is the random forest model
this algorithm creates a multitude of decision trees at training time,
and outputting the class that is the mode of classes,
or mean prediction of individual trees
this is capable of handling both classification
and regression to classify large data
the second algorithm is generalized linear model
this is used for analyzing the effects of continuous variables

on a discrete or continuous dependent variable
it helps in predicting the behavior of complex systems,
financial and biological data
the next one is the gradient boosted model
this produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of
other weak prediction models
this builds the model in a stagewise fashion
and generalizes them by allowing optimization of an
arbitrary differentiable loss function
the next is k means algorithm this algorithm finds k clusters in a set of data,
its applications its needs,
where cluster is a group of data pointswith similar features
that are grouped together the centroids of k clusters are used
to label the new data the next algorithm is named profit algorithm
this is used mainly for prediction of time series data
that have strong seasonal effects
and several seasons of historical data
the next one is the linear model
this uses the statistical method linear regression
for predictive model construction
the next one is the decision tree which is also known as
and benefits, various benefits of predictive analytics
classification and regression tree or cart in short
this is a sequence of branching operations
depicted in the form of tree based on comparisons of some quantities,
the comparisons being a assigned unit computational cost
the next one is support vector machine,
which is used in machine learning for classification
this segregates two classes with the hyperplane
this is commonly used for classification, sometimes for clustering also
next one is the naive bayes algorithm
this naive bayes classifies a assumes the presence of
,in this lesson,we'll be seeing the predictive analytics models
one feature in a class that is not related to any other
this is every pair of future being classified as independent of each other

to effectively manage the cost
down the supply chain until the end customer
dear learners, welcome back to lesson three on
predictive analytics are increasingly important to supply chain management,
making the process with more precision,
reliability and reduced cost
,in the supply chain management system,
the uncertainity arises due to the following reasons,
inflated orders,long lead times, late deliveries,
product changes batch ordering, price fluctuations and discounts,
incomplete shipments, inaccurate demand forecasting
the various information technology tools and echnologies that enabling scm,
are electronic data interchange,
reductive analytics in supply chain management
radio frequency identification rfid,
e business,internet, barcode and point of sale
with advancements in technology and data growth
there is a strong requirement of quick response
for any organization to keep up with the escalating competition
this forces the supply chain management system
to adopt the suiting technology to grow their business,
besides preserving the providing benefits
for this many of the available predictive models,
combining data mining and machine learning techniques extend a helping hand
the previous two lessons,we saw about the predictive analytics need
the architecture recommended here
has the following details
applications of predictive analytics is expected to have a clear and
positive impact on improving the accuracy of forecasts
product tracing and offering growth paths
it is identified and classified the use cases for
supply chain analytics based on importance and level of adoption
these included inventory level optimizations,
production and sourcing optimizations reduce cost,
identifying and resolving quality defects and root causes,
and applications benefits, followed by
identifying product costs variances,
analyzing customer service level performance,
tracking product traceability, analyzing forecast
accuracy andmany more
organizations can use predictive insights for supply chain
and logistics in the following ways
the first one is the improved personalization

and on time delivery of goods may be ensured
next is customer visibility
insights about suppliers, customers and business partners
may be analyzed and taking
quicker action and intelligent decision is done here
next is third party logistics
technology partners may be outsourced if necessary
next is transportation management system
uncertainties that arise in transportation and
and foreward supply chain management
shipping may be handled efficiently
overall, the predictive models are expected todo the following
to predict the on time delivery of goods using
data driven machine learning methodology
to collect data from heterogeneous sources, clean and combine
to sift out useful information
to incorporate business intelligence tools
to diagnose customer data
to identify the reasons for error occurrence and able management
the machine learning algorithms such as
supply chain management is the management of a network of
random forest, support vector machine,
and gradient boosting may be applied to train the transactional data set
that helps in identifying the
likelihood of day late delivery and returns
,the various ways machine learning
or artificial intelligenceis revolutionizing scm or as follows
the new approach and insights from
machine learning have greater impact on supply chain management activities
the one, first point is at supplier level,
the transportation quality may be measured using
interconnected business activities involved in
interests of marketing and supply chain processes
this is achieved by supply chain processes by obtaining timely
information from marketing on trends in new customers or
product, customer segments, promotional plans and over or
under delivery and providing information on lead time,
capacity and cost of supply chains on having understood the
phases in demand chain management and the role of
supply chain let us conclude the module on integrated
customer lifecycle, demand management and supply chain
management with the conceptual model the exercise for you at the
the phases in demand management, we note that demand chain
end of the modules is, visit the retail outlet and map the
customer lifecycle, demand chain processes and supply chain processes
thank you and welcome you all to the next session
music
management aims to create value to the customers by combining
the strengths of marketing and supply chain competencies
the four phases of demand chain management is as follows:
in the previous lesson, we also understood the first phase of
demand management from the fusion model of integrated
customer lifecycle, demand processes and supply processes
we look into the next three phases and the role of supply chain management
phase two of demand management is managing digital integration
managing the information flow across the
dear learners in the last lesson we covered what is demand management and the
demand management processes and supply processes is an
important component of business processes, this provides
necessary information for customer buying decisions
to meet the requirement, organizations implement systems
that enables seamless information flow and knowledge
enabled processes across the supply and demand chains
they ensure that the information flow is well integrated
with the advent of information technology,
the organizations employ digital integration
so, what is digital integration?
first phase in demand management that is integrating demand and
digital integration means linking the processes through information technology
and it includes both information systems and technology
in supply and demand processes, digital integration links, the customer
relationship activities, logistical functions and strategic decisions,
this is done by integrating the
transactional systems management information systems, decision
support systems and stategic systems and by integrating the
various modules of enterprise resource planning, enterprise
operations, enterprise planning and monitoring, enterprise
integration and administration, customer relationship
supply processes in this session, we will discuss the
management, supply chain management and financial and
operations reporting we will learn this in detail under
supply chain information systems and now let us conclude
that digital integration is an important function of demand
chain and supply chain management as it enables timely
information flow for carrying out the operations and management
decisions, sales and customer purchase history when integrated
with procurement, manufacturing, inventory and logistics can
propel demand forecasting, product improvement, customised
offerings, customer specific sales promotions and mode of
next three phases namely digital integration, configuring the
physical distribution digital integration is important
to manage customer connectivity, smart procurement, order
fulfillment, service delivery and supplier collaboration
in the traditional environment, each functional area, namely
operations, finance, human resource and marketing were
viewed separately hence, the challenge in digital integration
is to identify the information, interdependency and integrate the processes
this has led to the next phase in demand management as
configuring the value systems and establishing
cross functional relationships phase-iii configuring the value systems
value systems and establishing cross functional relationships
the strategic objective of organizations is to satisfy
the customers better than the compititors
the customers prioritize, quality, variety, delivery time and after sale
service at minimum cost the organizations today meet this
expectation of customers by adding value to the customers
across the value chain activities of inbound logistics,
operations, outbound logistics, marketing and after sales service
the supporting activities namely administration,
finance, accounting, information technology
and human resources are also tuned towards achieving
by the end of the lesson, we will highlight the role of
competitive advantage in short, as all the organisational
functions are tuned towards adding value to the customers,
the value system of demand chain and supply chain are also
designed to meet the needs of the customer segments with
differentiated and customized products and services
phase-iv managing across functional relationship activities of
supply chain and demand chain spreads across all the
functional activities across the value chain as follows:
the value chain activity of new product development is linked to
the demand chain processes of market analysis, segmentation,
supply chain and demand chain processes across the customer lifecycle
targeting, forecasting, defining value proportion and the supply
chain processes of supplier network monitoring, supplier
collaboration, procurement strategy and logistics
the value chain activity of operations is interrelated with
demand chain processes of creation and delivery of the
value propositions and supply chain processes of logistics,
inventory management, material and information flow
and so is the value chain activity of marketing and sales
to the demand processes of physical distribution, cross selling
and upselling and supply chain processes of physical
let us move on to the phases in demand management
distribution and service offerings the value chain
activity of surfaces is supported by the demand chain
process of despatching, customising services and
offering services and the supply chain processes of monitoring
service networks, installation and maintenance service
this explanation of interdependency imposes the challenges of conflicting
key performance indicators "key performance
indicators is a measurement used to evaluate the success of an activity "
the success of supply chain processes is
determined by the effectiveness to overcome the conflicting
by recalling the meaning of demand management and

music
dear learners, supply chain management spreads across all the activities
,we will move on to the first lesson
in supply chain analytics
music
supply chain optimization and business analytics
music
optimization means making the best of everything
in management terms, it indicates the application of all resources
to maximize returns and minimize cost
music
supply chain optimization is the process of applications of tools and techniques
music
to reduce costs and improve performance
of all the supply chain activities
music
in supply chain management, tools and techniques are applied
to improve productivity and waste reduction
this has led to process reengineering in two areas:
music
cost reduction by identification of cost centers,
dwell time through transportation, ideal capacity and excess inventory
music
that are from inbound logistics to after sales services
improve the agility of the supply chain
through real time demand signals,
music
just in time inventory,flexible operations and strategic facility locations
music
in short,business chain optimization tools and techniques
are applied across the key components of supply chain
music
from demand forecasting to production management,
music
and even a little cost reduction or efficiency maximization
operations scheduling, inventory management,
network management, logistics management and reverse logistics
music
the operational and strategic decisions of effective supply chain indicated
music
the various supply chain optimization areas as
dynamic forecasting and aggregate planning,
music
strategic sourcing and purchase process supported by
transactional processes systems
will lead to value addition and competitiveness
effective transportation and inventory management through
strategic dwell time reduction,
music
capacity utilization and shortening lead time
music
internal integration strategies using erp
music
external integration through effective outsourcing
and integration across verticals
music
music
cost reduction and quick response through lean green and agile supply chains
music
across all the optimization initiatives,
the role of information technology is tremendous,
music
and it has moved to the extent of implementing thinking supply chains
music
for example, amazon has started to use robotics
music
in its order fulfillment centers and termed it as robotic fulfillment centers
the organisations implemented many techniques like
and c two ,c four and c five as a set
these sets are prune using the apriori property
all non empty subsets of the frequent item set must also be frequent
do any of the candidates have a subset that is not frequent?
for example, the two item subsets of c one c two
c three are c one c two ,c one c three and c two c three
allare members of l two therefore, keep
c one c two c three in c three
similarly,keep c one c two c five in c three
there two items subsets of c one c three c five
frequent patterns are patterns that are item sets, sub sequences,
are c one and c three c one and c five and c three and c five
c three and c five is not a member of l two and so, it is not frequent
similarly,a set of c one ,c 3,c four
a set of c two ,c three and c five and a set of c two c four and c five
is not a frequent member of a l two
, it is not frequent and they are removed
therefore, after pruning c three is equal to
a set of c one ,c two c three and c one , c two c five
the transaction in d are scanned in order to determine l three
consisting of those candidate item three as
or sub structures that appear in a data set frequently
sets having minimum support
the algorithm uses l three into l three , to generate
a candidate set of four item sets c four ,although the joint results in
c one c two c three and c five as a set
this item set is pruned because it's subset c two c three and c five
is not frequent thus c four is null and the algorithm
terminates having formed all of the frequent itemsets
the example demonstrates that the apriori_gen procedure
performs two kinds of actions, namely join and prune
for example, for an automobile manufacturer,
every frequent pattern generates multiple association rules
that are filtered based on score criteria like confidence and lift
many variations of apriori algorithm
have been proposed to improve efficiency some variations are:
hash based technique: technique that is shredding items
into corresponding brackets
transaction reduction: reducing the number of
transactions scanned in future iterations
partitioning, segregating the data to find candidate item set
sampling: mining on a subset of a given data
if he considers the data set of
dynamic itemset counting: adding candidate item sets
are different points during the scan
thank you learners this lesson introduced you to one of
the basic algorithms of frequent pattern mining that is used for
generating association rules
thank you and see you all in the next session
find two applications of frequent pattern mining
for supply chain optimization
and present it as an exercise thank you
purchase of various components from the supplier base and
data pattern can contain an itemset subsequence or substructure
a set of set of items for example, horns and navigation instrumennts
appear frequently together in a transaction data
of suppliers then it is called frequent items set
a subsequent such as or customer buying the car first, then various additional
dear learners in the previous lesson, we have discussed
components or accessories like high end speakers, stickers etc
occur frequently in a particular data set
then, it is a frequent sequential pattern
sub structures are referred to as sub graphs,
sub trees or sublattices if a sub structure
occurs frequently ,it is called frequent structural patterns
music
frequent pattern mining discovers associations
and correlations among items in that transactional or
relational databases by searches for recurring relationships in a data set
the importance and the various supply chain optimization
music
the process of building association rules consists of two steps
step one is finding association rules
and it consists of choosing the right set of items
generating rules by interrupting the counts in the
co occurrence table
step two is generating rules from all the data
the general algorithm use is an iterative process
to generate association rules as follows
generate the co-occurrence matrix for single items
rule mining tools with optimization models
generate the co-occurrence matrix for two items,
use this to find rules with two items
generate the co-occurrence metrics for three items and use this to find rules with
three items and so on
music
apriori some basic algorithm for finding frequent itemsets
it was proposed by r agarwal and r srikant in
one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four for mining frequent itemsets
apriori property indicates that
all non empty subsets of a frequent item set must also be frequent
,this lesson focuses on
this property belongs to a category of properties called
antimono tone, and implies that if a set cannot pass a test,
all of its subsets will fail the same test as well
the apriori algorithm is based on the fact that the algorithm uses
prior knowledge of frequent itemset properties
it is an iterative approach
usinga apriori property and employs a level wise search,
where k itemsets are used to explore k plus one item sets
the iterative process of apriori algorithm
based on candidate generation is called
introducing the learners to a prior algorithm
prune and join and it follows
the set of frequent one item set is found by scanning the database
to count for each item that satisfies minimum support
the resulting set is denoted as l one
next l one is used to find l two ,
the set of frequent two - itemsets which is used to find l three
and so on, until requent k- item sets cannot be found
a simple example is imagine a large scale manufacturer
who outsources various components from various suppliers
want to optimize its order processing,
for association rule generation with an example
transportation,and inventory by focusing on suppliers
who supply multiple components
the organization scans the transactional data
of each supplier to understand
frequent components purchase from each supplier
support of minimum two is set
and the data set is searched
let us consider the following data set of the auto components supplier order
data for car manufacturer
the apriori algorithm for finding frequent item
music
set in data set d is as follows
in the first iteration,the algorithm simply scans all the
transactions in order to count the number of co occurrence of each item
supply_chain_management_4387
frequent item set (l 1) is generated by comparing
candidate support count with minimum support count
here the minimum support count is two and all the items in c one
satisfy minimum support two
and each subset of the candidate is frequent
frequent item set is generated by joining l one into l one
association rules which reflect patterns of data are generated
to generate a candidate set of two items sets
next, the order transaction in d, are scanned and support count
of each candidate item set in c two is presented
the set of frequent two items set in c two having minimum support is generated
at level three they joined c three that is c two into c two
and you will find the subsets to b, c one c two c three
supply_chain_management_4401
a set of c one c two ,c five
set of c one c three and c five c two
c three c four as a set, and c two c three ,c five as a set,
using a technique called mining frequent item set

it is something not clear or vague
music
is
music
in many situations,
in all the activities in business
music
we cannot describe a condition or an event or a relationship as true or false
it might be partially true and such situations are termed as fuzzy
music
can
music
you give some examples? answer my question with a yes or no
music
was the rain heavy last night?
music
music
no, but it was moderate
music
do you drive your car fast?
music
no,i do not drive it too fast not too slow
music
was the food in the restaurant
music
good?
music
in this module, we will discuss the concept,
it was okay
music
as many times we cannot determine whether the state is true or false
music
it can be partially true, partially false
music
and the answer might lie between
music
true and false
music
music
this is the foundation of fuzzy logic
music
, what is fuzzy logic? in traditional boolean logic,
the state of a condition is viewed to be true or false
and the truth value is either zero or one
music
in fuzzy logic,the state of condition can be true,partially true, partially false
and false and the truth value can range from zero and one
music
fuzzy logic is a many valued or infinite valued logic
process and application of fuzzy logic
music
that provides the flexibility of reasoning
music
fuzzy models are mathematical models
music
that can recognize manipulate, interpret, and utilize data
music
and information that lacks certainty

detail, the supply chain operations reference model
the third lesson will briefly explain the other supply chain
operations reference models the objectives of the module is to
provide information of metrics for supply chain performance,
and elaborate on supply chain models for performance management
the learning outcome of the module is : by the end of the
session you will be able to identify and associate
performance metrics across the supply chains
apply supply chain management models
welcome learners, we will move on to the first lesson on supply
supply chain models dear learners, a supply chain model is
chain performance management and supply chain models
a supply chain is a global network of raw materials and merchandise
suppliers, manufacturers, logistics partners,
distributors, retailers and consumers who are linked through
flow of products and services, information and funds to meet
the customer need the integrated supply chain points
out that performance of supply chain it's not only the
performance of internal supply chain that is the manufacturers
or firm level, but it is the sum of performance of internal
supply chain, the performance of supply chain partners that is
a conception or quantitative model that explains the
the suppliers and distributors and the performance of extended
supply chains of collaborators and outsourcing partners etc
supply chains are focused on fulfilling customer needs by
value creation for end customer satisfaction and so the supply
chain performance is measured by responsiveness, reliability and
total cost of the entire supply chain
with this brief understanding, we will look into the supply chain performance
management systems and supply chain models
supply chain performance measures and metrics
the supply chain performance measures are classified into two :
operations, relationships, systems, networks decision
traditional performance measures and distinctive competitive
performance measures the traditional measures include use
of financial and stakeholders data analysis, to understand the
cost, revenue and profitability and the use of productivity and
turnover measures that is output to cost of inputs ratios
the measure can include total productivity, or factor wise
productivity like material productivity, and labour productivity
distinctive competitive performance measures
distinctive competitive performance measures identify
all the supply chain activities are linked to the firm's
framework or an aspect of supply chain in this module we will be
objectives and customer satisfaction the performance
measures across the capability areas namely quality, cost and
customer service, environmental performance according to gary s & j p
the specific supply chain performance measures on
total supply chain management cost, supply chain cash to cash cycle :
production flexibility : delivery, perfect order
fulfillment, e-business performance, environment performance
we will move on to the understanding the role of
supply chain operations in relations to supply chain performance
performance management and supply chain models
learning on supply chain management models for
the supply chain council has recognized supply chain
models to integrate supply chains and to measure the
performance of supply chain partners the model spreads
across the entire supply chain from raw material supplier to
the end customer and covers three major areas, namely market
interactions, transactional interactions and customer interactions
the market interactions covers all processes from
market analysis and demand forecasting to delivery of products and services
the transaction interactions are all transactions and decisions from
idea generation to product development, delivery and services
performance management the module is presented as three lessons
it involves end to end transactions and information
exchange between suppliers, distributors and customers
customer interactions includes the entire supply chain
processes across customer buying cycle from need identification
to purchase and consumption of products and services
the supply chain models are designed to define and diagnose supply
chain processes and performances to reengineer the processes
and benchmark the best practices the popular supply chain models are
supply chain operations reference model,
design chain operations reference model,
the first lesson will explain supply chain performance
customer chain operations reference model,
managing the supply chain performance,
product life cycle operation reference model
with this introduction to performance metrics and supply chain models,
i request you to ponder on the following points
identify the supply chain processes,
and define performance metrics for businesses like swiggy and zomato
thank you and meet you all in the next session on supply chain models
music
and performance metrics and supply chain models for
performance management the second lesson will deal in
integrate and implement best practices of supply chain management
components, performance processes, practices and people
with this explanation of scor a self-study exercise for you
identify the scor framework of any company and brief the scor process levels
thank you
music
organizations have successfully integrated scor
model into their business framework and noted that scor
resulted in reduced inventory, enhance customer service,
streamlined supply chain processes and redefined organizational supply chain,
improved operational flexibility
and now we will look into the scor model components and the
structure under the following headings five process blocks,
level of process and performance measures across the process elements
and components of scor scor process blocks
the five processes in scor are plan, source, make, deliver, and return
dear learners, in this session we will discuss supply chain
the plan includes processes that refer to demand and supply planning
the sub processes are
leveraging resources with requirements designing business
rules related to inventory, capital assets, logistics
and compliances to regulatory standards communication plans
for supply chain defining standards to improve and measure supply chain efficiency
sources includes all processes to procure raw materials,
stocks make to order and engineer to order goods
or services to meet the real or anticipatory demand
it include processes related to scheduling, procurement
operations reference model in detail
and deliveries, identifying, selecting and establishing
supplier networks, order placement, fulfillment and
authorizing payments, inventory management, managing supplier
agreements and supplier relationship assessing supplier
performance monitoring material acquisition and sourcing infrastructure
make unclearall the processes related to production of
make to stock make to order and engineer products
it includes scheduling production activities, managing
work-in-progress, equipment, facilities and the production network
delivery includes all processes related to outbound logistics
supply chain operations reference model is a framework
from moving the product from the place of manufacture to the customer
it includes customer and processes of order
management, from receiving order enquiry to delivery, developing
quotes and roping shipment logistics, product life cycle
management finished inventory management, managing compliances
related to sales, imports and exports return inputs all
processes to handle the returns of materials purchase to the
suppliers and returns of finished goods from the customers
it involves application of return policies
developed by the organization's authorization and scheduling
for performance analysis and performance
returns, receiving verifying and reverse logistics of products,
replacement and reverse logistics, regulatory compliance
and asset management, after sales customer support
and follow up scor describes the prisoners activities
to satisfy the customer demand the activities are organised
across the supply chains around the five process blocks
namely plan, source, make, deliver and return
how do organizations implement scor framework?
the four steps scor implementation
process includes level one defining scope and process type
enhancement across the supply chain
level two configuration of process categories to supply
chain process types level three defining process elements
level four implementation of supply chain
management practices by integrating processes, metrics,
best practices and execution of supply chain at level one of
defining scope and process categories, the organization
select the supply chain process categories and select
performance attributes that best describes them
therefore performance attributes are realiability, responsiveness,
agility, cost and asset management efficiency
is a tool employed by manufacturing and service industries
at level two and three the scor processes are defined as
process type, process elements, process flow diagrams,
and tasks to be achieved the inputs, process elements,
outputs and performance metrics for each process element within
the flow diagram is defined best practices can also be
identified at this level supply chain management
practices are identified and implemented
the level four involves integrating business process re-engineering,
benchmarking and best practice analysis with scor framework
and implementing supply chain management practices
to analize, benchmark and improve the processes of supply chain management
for enhanced supply chain performance
the three techniques at this level are business process re-engineering,
redesign the core supply chain activities to meet the future competitive markets
benchmarking, quantifying the supply chain
operations performance with similar companies and best
industry practices best practice analysis, characterize
the management practices and software solutions that result
in superior performance the four components of score model
are performances, metrics for evaluating supply chain process
performance, and defining the strategic goals
it is a management tool used to communicate supply chain
processes, management processes and process relationship
practices, management practices for better supply chain performance,
people skills and competencies of people to perform supply chain procesess
to sum up, supply chain operations reference model is a
framework to describe, measure and evaluate supply chain processes
the major elements of scor model are process blocks, plan,
source, make, deliver and return process levels, defined
scope, process catagories and performance metrics
configure process pipes to supply chain processes
defined process elements, workflows, and related performance metrics
decisions within a company, suppliers and customers of a company
resources and talent development with business strategies
it provides knowledge on how to implement well defined and
repeatable supply chain processes m four sc is about
layered management of supply chain in line with business
strategies it involves four modules module one is managing
supply chain strategies, how to manage supply chain strategies
managing supply chain strategies involve segmenting businesses
into supply chain and determining performance
the activities include business plan analysis, supply chain
segmentation, supply chain swot analysis, supply chain strategy,
as the word indicates, design chain
definition and supply chain gap analysis the feedback from the
first layer manage strategy provides feedback for optimizing
supply chain networks for strategic performance requirements
the second module is managing networks, managing
networks includes supply chain network definition, network
analysis, solution definition, network definition and network
change prioritization the feedback from the network
definition leads to the next layer of management that is
management of supply chain processes
the module three is manage processes the third layer of
operations reference model, it focuses on three product design
manage processes involved process flow capture, process
value stream model, process raci analysis that is defining
and understanding the role of various stakeholders in the
supply chain process definations and process change prioritization
at this level, supply chain processes are
aligned towards strategic network goals the deliverables from
this layer of management provides insights of next
layer of management that is resource management
the fourth layer of m four sc is managed resources the managed resources
involves skill capture and skill resource planning, procedure
environments, namely product refresh, new product
capture, technology resource planning, organizational review,
planning resources, and resource change prioritization
supply chain resources involves continuous alignment of
resources to meet process goals the four layered management as
defined by m four sc leads to well defined scalable supply chain processes
the supply chain coun presence the m four sc
layered management as follows
thank you all and meet you all in the next session on
push and pull supply chain strategies
thank you
and new technology
music
design chain operations reference model is organized
across five process blocks related to research and design
and they are plan, research, design, integrate and amend
plan involves development and establishment of course of
action and projected design change resources
research involves all management processes
supply chain models dear learners, in the last session we discuss the score
of identification of research problem collecting,
synchronizing and evaluating information, publishing and
authenticating the research findings and identification of
source of supply sourcing and validation of materials
and products against requirements
the design includes process of creation, analysis and testing
the product design, releasing the requirements specifications
of an existing product, and reviewing and adjusting the
processes of sourcing, manufacturing, testing,
servicing and disposal integrate is a management process
model and in this session we will look into design chain
that links refreshed products and new product definitions to
supply chain activities amend involves management processes
that gather and analyze the issues in product design and manufacturability
the dcor structure comprises three process types
the process types are planning processes,
execution processes, and enable process the planning process of
dcor includes alignment of expected resources to expected design
requirements and balancing aggregate demand
the execution process on the other hand, involves scheduling
and sequencing, research and design, material sourcing
operations reference model dcor, customer chain operations
and integration and amendment they enable processes, prepare,
maintain, and manage information and relationship across the
design chain operations as in the score model dcor also
has performance metrics and performance attributes
the performance metrics and performance attributes are as follows
the performance metrics are perfect product design,
product design change cycle time, total design chain costs,
product design chain change cycle time, design change fixed
assets value the performance metrics are measured across the
performance attributes namely reliability reliability is the
reference model ccor and managing for supply chain
performance of the design and it is measured as correct design in
the correct format with correct documentation released are the
correct place and time responsiveness is the quickness
at which the design chain delivers the product to the customer
flexibility is the time taken to change the product
design, after it is released to the operations costing is this cost
of operating the entire design chain assets, assets indicate
effectiveness of managing fixed assets and working capital to
support design chain operations the design chain operations
reference model dcor provides an unified structure
performance m four sc we will look into design chain
that links the processes, performance metrics and
practices of research and development business processes
next we will discuss the customer operations reference model
the customer operations, are business activities that
converts the customer needs into an order
the customer operations reference model is a process framework in scor
structure that unifies sales operations and customer support
business processes, metrics and practices the process blocks
of customer chain operations reference model are plan, relate
sell, contract and assist the plan processes focus on
operations reference model dcor the design chain
prioritizing sales activities, assigning targets and planning resources
they relate processes is for development and
establishment of course of action to source and align required
resources to carry out the customer chain operations
sell is the process of establishing and monitoring the products and
services offered to the customers this includes
defining customer profile, scheduling sales, collecting
information from intermediaries, and releasing contract
the contract process is the process of pricing a product and
gaining customer agreement it includes receiving the request
operations reference model is a business framework in scor structure
for contract, configuring and pricing the proposal, obtaining
approval, publishing price list, obtaining customer agreement and
closing the deal assist is the process of providing after sales
support for products and services offered to the customers
this includes receiving and logging, post
sales support requirement, assigning support resources,
responding to customers queries, warranty claims
and feedback for products and services according to ccor
model, the performance across the customer chain is measured
with the following performance metrics customer growth rate,
it describes all business activities that link,
customer conversion rate, cost and revenue, customer franchise
average profit per business assist per customer, perfect
assist, assist cycle time, cost of assist, net customer loyalty index
dear learners, we have discussed the three supply chain
models namely scor, dcor, ccor and now we will
discuss the framework managing for supply chain performance
that is m four sc managing for supply chain performance is
a supply chain framework that links supply chain plans and policies
to business strategies it is a framework that assimilates
supply chain strategy, supply chain network, supply chain
research and development processes, performance metrics and practices
members of the supply chain through flow of material,
information and funds the process view of supply chain can
be explained under two headings : cycle view and push and pull view
what is the cycle view of supply chain?
the cycle view of supply chain indicates that
supply chain is a series of processes performed at
the interface of any two stages of supply chain
this can be understood with an example
the supply chain of a manufacturer who manufactures
and sells the products through the distributors
push and pull supply chain strategies
and the retailer will undergo four major supply
chain processes, that is purchase of raw materials,
manufacturer of products, distribute and stock the products
with the distributors, deliver the product as the customer
orders through the retailers this supply chain process when
viewed as a cycle is as follows the process at the interface
between the supplier and the manufacturer is the procurement cycle
the process at the next interface between the
manufacturer and the distributor is the manufacturing cycle
the process at the next link between the distributor and the
dear learner, welcome you all module on push and pull
retailer is stock replenishment cycle the process at the next
interface between the retailer and the customer is customer
order fulfillment cycle the process view of supply chain
indicates that, not all supply chains have to move through all
the interfaces, some supply chains will not have one or more interfaces
for example, a retailer who does not manufacture the product,
but only sells will not have the manufacturer cycle
and the manufacturer who distributes the products
through its own retail outlets will not have stock
replenishment cycle at the interface between manufacturer and retailer
supply chain strategies in this module, we will discuss the
, we will move on to the next point in the
cycle view of supply chain the second point indicates that
each cycle consist of various sub processes the sub processes is triggered
by the orders placed by the customers
or when the demand for the product is anticipated
and then the products are produced, it ends when the product is
delivered and services rendered to the customer
this subprocesses across the cycle is same as the scor model
processes of plan, source, make ,deliver and return
the supply chain operational decisions are
process view of supply chain, responsiveness of supply chain
based on the process view of supply chain
and the responsiveness of supply chain we will move on to
the next category in the process view of supply chain that is
push and pull view of supply chain the process view of
supply chain is defined as pull or push
what is push or pull view of supply chain?
the push or pull view of supply chain focuses on
the supply chain responsiveness, the supply chains can
respond to the anticipatory demand of the customer
or after the actual demand from the customer
and push, pull and postponement strategies in supply chain
, we will look into the push and pull supply chain
after having an understanding on supply chain responsiveness
what is supply chain responsiveness?
supply chain responsiveness is the ability of
the supply chain to cater to the huge quantities demanded
respond to the assortments and variety of
products demanded by the customers
deliver the products within a short time
after the customer has initiated his demand
and manage high quality service
let us discuss the process view of supply chain now
ensure that uncertainties in the supply does not affect the product delivery
and initiate and support the innovative product design and delivery
the responsiveness of the supply chain can be
triggered at two points on anticipation of the future
demand of the customer or in response to the customer order
the supply chain process in anticipation for the customer
order is push process and the supply chain process in response
to customer order is pull process in the next session,
we will discuss in detail the push and pull
supply chain processes with example
what is the process view of supply chain?
thank you
music
the process view of supply chain indicates that
supply chain is a sequence of processes that connect the
you towards their store this is push strategy
likewise, supermarket (b) had also made some attractive displays of some
products near the cash counters and even though those items are
not in your list, you get attracted and buy a product this is pull strategy
supply chain is an integral part of marketing
and customer satisfaction and hence supply
chains are designed to meet push and pull marketing strategies
we will move on to understand
what is push and pull supply chain strategy?
push supply chain is also known as anticipatory business model
dear learners, after the brief introduction of process view of
in push supply chain strategy, the supply chain function is to supply products
that are manufactured and stock based on the long term demand forecast
each partner in the supply chain hold inventory to meet the
anticipatory demand it is based on make to stock policy
when do organizations adapt push supply chain strategy?
push supply chains are adapted when firms follow the anticipatory business model
purchase behavior is not certain due to lack of real
time marketing information firms are involved in mass production
and have high volume sales and huge market share
manufacturers produce products based on demand
supply chain, we will discuss in detail the push and pull supply chain
forecast and not after receiving the order
firms plan to meet existing demand within short lead time
and then firms want to avoid stock outs
the challenges when following a push supply chain strategy are :
forecast not being accurate can led to differences in what the firm
plan to do and what the firm really did uncertainity and unplanned inventory
inability to meet sudden hike in demand for products or changing demands
conflict of interest among the trading partners
and risk of product obsolescence
in the traditional push strategy, the flow of information products
push and pull strategies evolved as marketing concepts
and negotiation is unidirectional,
and it is from manufacturers to the customers
an example of push supply chain strategies is that
of a retail outlet who anticipate the seasonal demand
changes in readymade garments and accessories even before the
summer season the apparel brands design the summer collections
and promote their designs other example is the mobile
brands who follow an anticipatory business model
and their supply chain logistics are driven by demand focus
and inventory management having understood the push strategy,
and it can be understood as follows you're having a grocery
now let us move on to pull supply chain or responsive business model
pull strategies followed by firms that adapt responsive
business model that is made to order philosophy
the logistics of supply chain is based on real time information of
the point of sale data and is driven by actual customer demand
the pool supply chain is triggered when customers place order
and this supply chain strategy has advantage of less wastage
in case of low demand the supply chain is practised when
manufacturers follow bill to order business strategy
scope of customization to meet customer demand is high
list of items to purchase at supermarket (a) you don't find the
supply chain is demand driven customer involvement and knowledge
demands direct connectivity firms aim at reducing inventory
level and inventory carrying costs flexibility to change
customer services to change in demand is mandatory
but the challenges are inventory shortage to meet
rising demands, flexibility in manufacturing and distribution
demands agile supply chains, customisation of operational
risk of multiple channel partner management, obtaining and
sharing accurate sales data from all supply chain partners is risky
high cost and risk of shortening the lead time
items you require so, you move to the other supermarket (b),
in pull strategy, the information and negotiation flow is not uni-direction
an example of pull supply chain processes
a fashion designer who produces apparels for customers after receiving
the order and its specification from the customer
other examples are computer brands who assemble computers after
receiving customer orders, designing automobile suppliers
and automobile service centers
having discussed what is push and pull supply chain,
the advantages and challenges in the next session,
we will discuss pull based push supply chain strategy
where you find the required items here supermarket (b)
and postponement strategy in the meantime,
identify the push and pull supply chain practices
of any three retail outlets and discuss on the same
thank you
has anticipated your monthly demand and stock the products
and brands in the required assortments to attract you and pushed
what is push pull boundary?
business firm today do not follow pure pull
strategy or pure push strategy instead, they have few supply
chain processes based on anticipatory demand and others
based on actual demand the firms set boundaries as to which of
the supply chain processes should be push processes
and which of them should be pull processes
this process classification as pull and push processes
sets the push and pull boundary
for example, if an apparel manufacturer makes
dear learners in the last session we discuss the practical
one hundred sweaters of standard size and stock them but dyes the sweaters
based on the real time order and delivers them as ordered
his supply chain and the push and pull boundaries are as follows
thus, in practice, the supply chain processes involve
identifying supply chain processes that depends on
anticipatory demand and the others that can focus on actual
demand and defining the push and pull boundary that can match
supply and demand effectively with the advent of information
technology, the supply chain is designed as pull based push
strategy, wherein the information flow to the customer
application of push and pull chains as follows
can be directly from the manufacturer or through the
supply chain partners the product flows from the
manufacturer through the supply chain partners
and the negotiation flow is bi- directional between the
customer and the manufacturer either directly or through the channel partners
the other examples of push pull boundary
are a computer manufacturer produces the various components
of the computer and holds stock of them but assembles and
delivers the computers only on receiving the customer order
a paint manufacturer produces various standard colours of
in this session, we will discuss push pull and postponement strategy
paints and stocks them at retail outlets but mixes the paint and
delivers them as per the customer choice at the retail outlet
a boutique holds various apparel material in stock
but does designing, stitching, and delivery on scheduled time
after receiving the order from the customer
the blending of push and pull strategies
as said above has led to supply chain strategy called postponement
what is postponement strategy? postponement strategy is
producing and holding inventory of a standard product state
based on anticipated demand but postponing the final
in supply chain in today's business scenario
manufacturing, customization or distribution of the product
until the customer order is received the two types of postponement are:
manufacturing postponement and geographical postponement
manufacturing postponement: manufacturing or form
postponement involves manufacturing a standard or a
base product in sufficient quantities while holding back
the finalization of customized features until the customer places the order
for example, a car manufacturer manufactures
the standard car but postpones the customization of the
features like car colour, seats, audio system, etc
with industrial and information technology revolution,
until the customer places the order for the car
next is geographical postponement in geographical
postponement the products are manufactured and stocked in one
geographical location but delivery of inventory is
postpone until the customer order is received
for example, a retail chain that sells its brand across the world
can anticipate the seasonal demand and produce the apparels
and stock it in the central warehouse which is strategically located
it captures the point of sale data from various retail
outlets and then decides which assortment in what quantity
time based competition is prevailing in all businesses
should be deployed to each region this is geographical postponement
learners having understood the push, pull and
postponement strategies in supply chain, you are requested
to visit any firm and map the supply chain processes
and define their push, pull and postponement strategies
thank you all for successfully completing
the second weeks course in supply chain
thank you
music
and this has led to blending of push and pull supply chain strategy
in supply chain management terms the blending of push and pull supply
chains is termed as push and pull boundaries
dear learners! welcome you all to the module on coordination in
the lead time is say ten weeks and if the retailer is
forecasting good demand for the product, then the retailer will
order it before ten weeks so that he is assured of the
product availability another problem occurs due to rationing
and shortage gaming for example, if a product is in high
demand and the supply is limited, then manufacturer
resort to rationing in which they provide less than ordered
quantity to wholesalers or retailers if retailers orders
ten units he might be given say five units so, what the
retailer might do is, he might order higher quantities say twenty
bullwhip effect, understand the ways and means to ensure supply
inorder to get his ten required units all these operational
obstacles will lead to increased variability of the product the
next one is pricing related obstacles this refers to
situations in which pricing policies of the product lead to
increase in variability
it includes lot sizes
based on quantity discounts and price fluctuations for example,
if manufacturer provides discounts based on lot sizes,
then wholesalers would place larger lot sizes than actual
requirement to enjoy discounts similarly, when price discounts
chain coordination in the first video we will focus on what is
are provided by manufacturer wholesalers and retailers will
do forward buying to utilize the discounts and after the discount
period orders will be significantly low in general
sales down the supply chain that is at the retailer level will
have lesser variability than sales up the supply chain that
is at the manufacturer level the last type of obstacles is
behavioral related it refers to problems in learning within
management that causes increased variability this happens when
each stage does not recognize its impact on another any stage
or stages are unable to identify the root cause of the problem
supply chain coordination and what are the obstacles to supply
sometimes, information may not have been shared by retailer
regarding local promotion which would have resulted in increased
order during that period and manufacturer would be unable to
trace the reason for the same different stages starts blaming
one another for fluctuations next is lack of trust in others
channel partners so, even if some channel partner is sharing
some information, the others don't rely on it and lastly,
the limited company perspective
the supply chain coordination is inevitable in order to optimize
productivity and profitability in the next video, we will
chain coordination
discuss on bullwhip effect its causes and consequences thank
you
we human beings are consumers of various products and
services in daily life like tea, bread, clothes, car, banking
and so on
have you ever thought of how such products and services
reaches? well, there are a whole lot of activities behind this
consumption the products and services are manufactured and
supply chain i would be presenting this module in three
delivered to end consumers through a network of value
adding activities called supply chain
supply chain activities involve procurement, processing,
production, logistics, inventory management, warehousing and so
on and include many channel partners like suppliers,
manufacturers, distributors, retailers and consumers there
arises the need for seamless integration of activities as
various parties work towards a common goal of providing the
customers with the right product at the right time and at the
right place this supply chain needs to be demand driven from
video lessons before moving on to the first lesson let us see
end consumer today, integration has become increasingly complex
due to technological innovations, globalization,
outsourcing practices and greater varieties having
understood the importance and complexity of supply chain
'coordination' shall be the only solution to ensure success of
supply chain companies involved in the supply chain network can
uptime competitive advantage through the supply chain
coordination
companies or channel partners
in a supply chain are dependent on each other for information,
the learning objectives of this module they are: to develop
material, and financial flows supply chain coordination occurs
when all stages take action together considering the
consequences of their actions on other stages supply chain
coordination aims at improving the overall performance and
total profitability of the supply chain by proper alignment
of the plans and objectives of the individual channel partners
such coordination would remove uncertainity and reduce
variability within the network in the traditional setup,
channel partners were working as silos or islands where every
channel partner would try to maximize their individual
understanding of supply chain coordination, explain bullwhip
profits and not the total supply chain profits such isolated
approach would lead to conflict among channel partners
therefore, each partner has to decide considering the impact on
other partners
moving on to incentive based obstacles it refers to
situations in which incentives provided two different channel
partners increases variability and reduces total supply chain
profits this includes local optimization within stages and
sales force incentives local optimization means trying to
optimize one stage or function without any regard to the impact
effect along with its causes and consequences, and to describe
it does on the entire supply chain for instance, if
transportation function decides to optimize by transporting only
full truck loads, then it would increase inventory and
inventory holding cost sales force incentives are generally
provided to increase sales but how to be dealt with care there
are two broad categories of sales force incentives:
first one "sell in" approach
which means the units of products sold by manufacturer to
distributor or retailer and the second one is "sell out" approach
which means the units of products sold by retailer to end
ways to minimize bullwhip effect
consumer if sales force incentives are planned with sell in
approach then it would result in excessive selling within stages
and high fluctuating order quantities during the period of
incentives the next one is information-processing
obstacles this refers to a situation in which demand
information is distorted as it moves between various stages
resulting in increased variability this is called as
bullwhip effect which we will further discuss in the next
video information processing obstacles includes forecasting
based on orders and lack of information sharing among
at the end of the session,
stages for instance, the manufacturer relies on the
wholesaler regarding order quantity without knowing the
actual demand at the customer end similarly, the wholesaler
relies on information from retailers without knowing the
actual customer demand so, when the manufacturer or wholesaler
does prediction with such received demand data then actual
demand data, then variability increases up the supply chain
similarly, if a retailer like d-mart is offering some
promotions to increase sales and if the same information is not
shared among the channel partners then it would result
learners will be able to appreciate the need for supply
in increased variations now moving on to operational
obstacles it refers to actions taken in the course of placing
and filling orders that leads to increased variability this
includes ordering in larger lots, large replenishment lead-
time, and rationing and shortage gaming retailers or wholesalers
prefer to order in larger lots to take advantage of discounts
but it may significantly increase variability if there is
a higher difference between demand fluctuations and order
fluctuations large replenishment lead-time is also
an obstacle for supply chain coordination for instance, if
chain coordination, comprehend the causes and consequences of
this might result in increased variability and uncertainty
the next one be rationing and shortage gaming when there is shortage of products,
the suppliers will ration the product
to the downstream channel partners
therefore, downstream channel partners
place excess demand order so that they can meet their actual needs
after rationing this leads to sharing of
inflated demand than actual demand for the product between the channel members
so, these are the reasons for happening of bullwhip effect
now let us move on to the consequences of bullwhip effect
one of the world's best producer of household products
on performance in the supply chain
if you look at the various performance measures
such as manufacturing cost
it increases because of bullwhip effect, inventory cost increases,
transportation cost again increases,
replenishment lead-time increases due to bullwhip effect,
labour cost also increases, whereas,
profitability, product availability decreases due to bullwhip effect,
and finally looking at the shipping and receiving costs
it also increases due to bullwhip effect
faced the problem of extreme demand variations
music
it is clearly evident that information distortion
across the supply chain causes bullwhip effect
this arises due to inefficient forecasting,
poor communication, larger orders, price fluctuations,
free return policies and rationing and shortage gaming
the bullwhip effect increases cost to the company reduces product availability
increases lead time and reduces the total
profitability of the supply chain
dear learners! having understood what bullwhip effect
for one of its best selling brands pampers diapers
and the consequences of it,
let us learn about the ways and means of minimizing
the bullwhip effect in the next video
thank you
the logistics executives at procter & gamble examined
the order rates for pampers across the supply chain
to they are surprise they found that the infant birth rate and
baby diaper usage has remained stable
but there were variations noticed in the orders placed
the purchase rate was found to be more or less steady at the consumer end
but the logistics executives on further investigation found that
dear learners from the previous video,
the variation in orders increased from the retailer level
to the distributor level and further up the supply chain
procter & gamble termed this lack of coordination as the "bullwhip effect"
music
it refers to the situation in which fluctuations in order
increases from the retailers to wholesalers to manufacturers to suppliers
this can also be referred as "forrester effect",
named after the founder, jay forrester, in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one
it is named by the wave the amplitude of a whip increases along its length
imagine a person holding a whip in his hand
you would have understood that conflict among supply chain partners
and then that person moves their wrist a bit it causes amplified
wave pattern in a chain reaction bullwhip effect arises
because demand for goods is based on
forecasting than the actual consumer demand
also, every channel partner would like to avoid stock out position
and therefore, escalates the actual demand
the bullwhip effect distorts demand information
within the supply chain each channel partner
would have a different estimate of the demand
this would lead to lack of supply chain coordination among
and distortion in information causes damage to coordination
different channel partners let us discuss the same
with the hypothetical example
consider actual demand from customers
for a product to be eight units
now retailer places order for
ten units from the distributor in order to ensure sufficient stock
so, what the retailer has done is he has placed two units
excess than actual demand
next distributor orders twenty units from the manufacturer
placing bulk orders so that future demand
supply_chain_management_5446
from the retailers can be met
so the distributor has placed
twelve units in excess of the actual demand
now manufacturer orders forty units
from the supplier to take advantage of economies of scale,
which is thirty-two units excess than actual demand
forty units are manufactured for the actual demand of eight units
the excess goods produced will be stored which requires
excess inventory space and it also increases inventory carry cost
or the excess goods have to be sold at a discount
in this video we will discuss: the significance of coordination
music
this is generally forecast demand as customer demand
is rapidly stable and in doing so,
they rely on a lot of information
from the channel members in the supply chain
the channel members down the supply chain do not share
reliable information to the upstream partners for various reasons
which finally end up in bullwhip effect
let us move on to the reasons number one be disorganisation
the stages in the supply chain function as independent units
what exactly is bullwhip effect? its causes and consequences
and therefore they either over or under react
to orders from the downstream supply chain
the next one is lack of communication
as there is lack of information flow between the stages, each stage perceives
the demand order according to their perceptions and experience
and therefore each stage has a different demand picture in front of them
free return policy consumers may intentionally
overstate the demand for the product due to
cancellation and free return policies which might end up in
retailer ordering excess quantities than needed
before moving further to "bullwhip effect"
the next one is order batching instead of small orders,
companies tries to accumulate various orders and then place larger orders
they do so inorder to minimize ordering cost
and to take advantage of bulk buying
this might lead to high demand
in some period followed by no or limited demand at times
the next reason be price variations
buyers would exhibit different buying patterns
when prices of products are not stable
channel members might introduce discounts which would alter
let us understand the origination of the term in the industrial setup
the routine buying patterns
buyers engage in forward buying
to enjoy the discounts or sometimes even postpone purchases
in anticipation of some price cuts in future
this would lead to severe demand fluctuations and uneven production
the other reason would be relying on past demand
that is, sometimes channel partners rely on
demand information of previous years to forecast
the demand for the current period without considering
any fluctuations for that period
in the early one thousand, nine hundred and ninety s procter & gamble,
customers would be frustrated
if they had to wait for the product
therefore, material and information delays
have to be reduced or eliminated
this would be possible by practicing
lean supply chain systems
which would eliminate unnecessary processes
also, the number of tiers in the supply chain
could be reduced in order to improve efficiency
music
a fully integrated solution would result in optimal results
coordination has become vital to improve
supply chain profitability
as it encompasses a complex structure
conflict among channel partners and smooth flow of information
are the biggest challenges
for ensuring supply chain coordination
it is obvious that bullwhip effect
cannot be eliminated completely
but companies might minimize the bullwhip effect
using coordination mechanisms such as information sharing,
it is not always practiced by the independent organizations
stable prices, contracts, smaller order batches,
joint decision making and with advanced (it) tools
thank you! dear learners
each channel member usually prefers to optimize their individual objectives
rather than working on total supply chain performance and profitability
such an attitude could hamper the growth of the supply chain in the long run
therefore, it is important to introduce
necessary coordination mechanisms in order to overcome
supply chain inefficiencies and to achieve overall supply chain profitability
music
let us now move on to various coordination mechanisms
dear learners, in the previous videos
that are available to minimize bullwhip effect in the supply chain
let us discuss them one after the other
the first one being information sharing
each stage is managed by different entities
therefore, information such as inventory data,
end consumer data, sales data, production schedule,
capacity, quality, and lead-time shall be shared
online or offline to ensure coordination
the end customer demand information needs to be shared
with the upstream members in the supply chain
we had discussed about supply chain coordination,
walmart, for instance, shares the point of sales data
with its major suppliers like (procter & gamble)
so that exact demand is shared with supply chain partners
this would help the upstream members
to work with actual data instead of indirect demand data,
but still there may be differences in forecast
due to the various methods and techniques employed for forecasting
also there are advanced initiatives like, vendor managed inventory,
quick response that is (qr), then efficient customer response,
collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment
its obstacles, bullwhip effect, its causes and consequences
techniques in order to assist
smooth information flow between the channel partners
the next strategy available is joint decision making
in this approach, various supply chain members
jointly plan and decide on forecasting,
product design, replenishment, incentive schemes,
profit sharing, ordering, scheduling, and advertising
raw data of actual sales captured using
(pos) shall be used for single forecasting
and may be shared across various stages
in this video, we will discuss the various mechanisms
here, channel partners shall avoid
repetitive processing of demand data
the next coordination mechanism is price stability
it is necessary to adapt price stability to ensure coordination
decisions such as everyday low pricing
to be adapted instead of promotional pricing,
so that bullwhip effect would be minimized
such pricing policy would encourage
stable buying behavior among buyers
it will also enable buyers
available to achieve coordination in supply chain
to refrain from forward buying or postponement of purchases
in anticipation of price discounts or promotions
walmart has been very successful with the (edlp) strategy
another way to ensure price stability is to provide
discounts based on volume and not on lot sizes
the next coordination mechanism is supply chain contracts
several different contract types
such as buyback, revenue sharing,
quantity flexibility, sales rebates,
service territories, and quantity discount contracts are available
music
to improve coordination among the channel partners
such contract improves loyalty and relationship among the channel partners
toyota entered into long term contracts
with its suppliers to gain trust and confidence
another mechanism would be
the use of (it) tools
internet, rfid, edi, pos, erp systems
are few (it) tools that facilitate
coordination in the supply chain
these tools enable visibility to all channel members
in general the various organizations
and therefore, increases responsiveness
dell's direct sell model has been successful
with its online order capturing system
haier's major success is through
online supply chain activities
the next coordination mechanism being smaller order batches
large order batches
increases fluctuations and contribute to bullwhip effect
therefore, small order batches to be encouraged
by the upstream supply chain partners
in the supply chain are independent parties
necessary action to be taken to reduce fixed cost
associated with ordering, transporting, and receiving each lot
this can be made possible
by having transportation aggregation
with third party logistics, providers,
and by reducing order processing cost
through automation and (erp) systems
web-based ordering also can be used for smaller orders
the last mechanism of i level to reduce bullwhip effect
would be reducing the delays
though it is an established fact that
supply_chain_management_5625
shipping and delivery cost
besides cost-per-touch ikea follows
the max /min replenishment system
for its product reordering
for all the products two factors are set:
the minimum amount of products available before reordering
and the maximum amount of a product to order at one time
at ikea the max,min levels are usually set by the stock needed for one day
all ikea locations have an in-store logistics manager
the in house logistics managers collect
understand means of achieving sustainability in supply chain
the point of sale data regarding sales
using the central inventory management software
the inventory system at ikea also notifies deviations if any
ikea further uses separate high flow
and low flow warehouse facilities very efficiently
in high flow warehouses high demand products are stocked
and the storage and retrieval processes are highly automated
in high flow warehouses low flow warehouse facilities,
products that have low demand are stocked in low flow warehouses
where the processes are manual
in this video we will discuss supply chain sustainability,
these sustainability strategies
have given competitive advantage for the
retailer ikea and it is highly successful
with low operating cost and high product demand
to conclude, we have discussed
what supply chain sustainability is all about?
along with its significance
the factors affecting sustainability of the supply chain
in the next lesson, we will discuss on the framework
for evaluating sustainability in supply chain
its significance, factors affecting sustainable supply chains,
thank you
along with the case lead
well, dear learners i'm sure, all of you are aware
of what a supply chain is?
let's consider a bottle of pepsi that we consume
how does that reach us? there are a lot of activities
in the whole process such as procurement of raw materials,
such as sparkling water, cane sugar, caramel,
warm greetings to all in this session,
apple extracts, natural plant extracts and so on
then processing the same in manufacturing unit, storage,
transporting and distribution of the same to end consumers
all these activities involved in moving the raw material
to the end consumers as finished goods are termed as supply chain
we know that all these activities consume a lot of natural resources
such as energy, raw materials and alike, which are limited
further each process gives out a lot of waste
in the process such as carbon emissions, solid, and liquid waste
here comes the need for sustainability
i would like to discuss about sustainability in supply chain
in organization which connects the suppliers
and end consumers does not exist on its own
it's a part of the whole world and is bound to be responsible to society
an organization takes a lot of inputs
from nature and society and delivers output back to the society
therefore,the organization has to be responsible for designing and implementing
what is called a sustainable supply chain?
having seen the significance let us now see what exactly is
supply chain sustainability?
well, supply chain sustainability
the learning objectives: to understand
is a holistic view of supply chain processes
and activities that addresses the environment,
social, economic, and legal aspects thoroughly
today,organizations not only strive towards profitability
but also they struggle to meet sustainability norms
therefore, sustainability in the supply chain is more a strategic approach
which has to align with an organization's goals, planning, and implementation
a sustainable supply chain
demonstrates a long- term commitment
to the procurement and supply chain management
the importance of sustainability in supply chain,
that considers: the environmental,
social and economic consequences of design,
non-renewable material use, manufacture and production methods,
logistics, service delivery use, operation,
maintenance, reuse, recycling options, disposal,
and suppliers capabilities to address
these consequences throughout the supply chain
this definition has been given by the department for environment
food and rural affairs two thousand and six
the major driving forces towards supply chain sustainability are: number one:
describe the framework for evaluating sustainability,
improving profits and to reduce risk,
number two, government mandates and community pressures
and finally attracting new generation customers
who value sustainability
now let's move on to the factors affecting supply chain sustainability
they are: waste from various processes,
carbon footprint and emissions,
air pollutants, water pollution, safety violations,
deforestation, non degradable packaging, and labour law violations
having seen the meaning of supply chain sustainability
and to discuss ways and means of enhancing sustainability in the supply chain
let us discuss a real case example of a company
that has moved way ahead in its sustainability efforts
ikea is one of the world's largest home furnishing retailer
with more than four hundred and eleven locations across forty-nine countries
and it has sincerely committed to planet and people
following are some of the sustainability initiatives at ikea
ikea products, including packaging are made from renewable
or recycled products
ikea uses few materials for making the products
without any compromise on quality or durability thereby saving cost
at the end of the session the learners would be able to
ikea has introduced a code of conduct
for its suppliers, namely iway, that is ikea way of purchasing
home furnishing products which has accounted for
positive impact on environment way beyond compliance
ikea almost produces 1/3 rd of their total energy consumption
through renewable energy sources
such as solar power, energy from wind mills and bio-mass
ikea strictly restricts child labour in its supply chain
it has also banned pvc in their products and lead from mirrors
ikea has moved from incandescent bulbs to energy efficient led bulbs
appreciate the need for sustainability in supply chain,
in all their stores ikea sources raw materials
such as wood and cotton from certified sustainable sources
ikea, collects point of sale data regarding sales, ideas, and smart solutions
ikea has reduced transportation related carbon emissions
significantly by switching to electric vehicles
ikea uses cost-per-touch inventory approach
which means the more hands that touch a product in the supply chain
the higher will be the cost
customers select their items,
pick them into warehouse and go home thus, ikea saves on
comprehend the dimensions of sustainability in the supply chain,
dear learners! in this video we will discuss on various methods
stages in the supply chain, to identify inefficiencies,
automate decision making, and improve customer's buying experiences
to conclude, sustainable supply chain provides enormous benefits
to the organization such as increased profitability,
reduced operating costs, new product and process innovation,
optimal use of natural resources, retention of human talents,
increased reputation, greater engagement with local communities,
and above all, creating a safer planet to live
achieving sustainability in the supply chain cannot happen overnight
it needs strategic thinking, planning, and execution
though initially sustainability solutions
with the cooperation of all stakeholders
companies therefore, could take proactive steps
towards its sustainability initiatives
no doubts, such initiatives
would add cost initially, but for sure, the companies would fetch
significant returns in the long run
sustainable supply chains are the only solution for
cleaner, safer earth
thank you happy learning!
may involve some upfront cost, it would bring in
reasonable gains in the long term
it is necessary for companies to understand
the impact of their supply chain on people and environment
negative social and environmental impact
would lead to legal risk, financial loss, and damage of reputation
once the companies understand their sustainability impacts,
it needs to identify suppliers, understand the
environmental and social challenges faced by suppliers
by which we can ensure sustainability in the supply chain
and then prioritize them manufacturers need to prioritize
suppliers based on their sustainability reports and performance
further, suppliers who score well on sustainability
could be provided suitable incentives by the manufacturers
so that they remain motivated the next would be to set goals
and communicate to all stakeholders
it is better to have sustainability goals
in their mission and vision so that
the significance is better communicated
manufacturers need to communicate their sustainability efforts
we are living in an era of global warming, depletion, and
throughout the supply chain right from suppliers to end consumers
for the manufacturers can establish necessary code of
conduct for suppliers, wholesalers, distributors and
retailers and monitor the sell for instance, walmart aspires to
be a packaging neutral company by two thousand and twenty-five
walmart has convinced its suppliers
such as (procter & gamble), (johnson & johnson) and
(unilever) to find greener sources for their products
the next is ethical sourcing practices:
manufacturers need to be vigilant on their target suppliers
exploitation of natural resources
they need to monitor the extraction
and production of raw materials by the suppliers
further, they need to monitor closely if the suppliers
confirm to the sustainability standards and code of conduct
set by them
annual audits could also be done to measure
the performance of suppliers
the next one is to identify and reduce waste
manufacturers need to identify and reduce waste in any form
such as inventory waste, process, production,
life on earth would become highly challenging
administrative, distribution related waste and they have to
work on improving the same
supply chain processes need to be simplified
and continuous monitoring and feedback system
would help in reducing the waste
for instance, the world's largest
footwear and sports apparel manufacturer nike with more than
seven hundred factories across forty-two countries practices, zero waste approach
they work towards circular future where
everything is reused and nothing is wasted
if manufacturers do not incorporate
nike has significantly reduced
its carbon emissions by adapting innovative
and modernization in its processes
and by using less recycled materials,
less water for manufacturing, and all of
these things have contributed in achieving supply chain success
the next approach would be training and capacity building programs
suppliers need to be trained in sustainability
practices and its benefits manufacturers could organize
training and capacity building programs for their suppliers and
sustainability in their supply chains
transfer best practices and case studies
vendor conferences, workshops, online training modules,
to be conducted on regular basis
so that suppliers could develop their competencies
industry collaborations: manufacturers need to partner
and collaborate with other sustainable businesses in order
to stay competitive
this would enable them to share best practices
and to implement reforms in their supply chain
for instance, it would help in combined transportation, thereby
today, government is also
saving money
the next one is optimal use of technology and data
supply chains are complex network of people with higher
dependence on each other
digital platforms assist manufacturing companies
to track the sustainability progress of their suppliers through
monitoring, surveys, and audits
for instance, (unilever) ensures sustainable sourcing through
technology as it collects data from the farmers in their supply chain
with the help of a software
insisting on sustainability by businesses with its laws,
further, technology based advancements in supply chain
can be witnessed by way of
data-driven transportation management systems,
intelligent routing software, autonomous trucks, automated warehousing,
and much more
supply chain also generates lot of data
technologies such as internet of things, machine learning,
artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing,
blockchain, and satellite technology uses enormous data
and information to track the product movement across the
rules, and regulations
dear learners! in this video, we will discuss
with rupees eleven thousand, two hundred crores of profit after tax in the financial year two thousand and eighteen
and has also achieved other standards
in accordance with global reporting initiative
itc has been carbon-positive for thirteen consecutive years,
water-positive for sixteen consecutive years,
and solid waste recycling positive for the past eleven years
it has set up twenty-three platinum-certified
green buildings and has created six million livelihood opportunities
the company does intensive watershed development
and large scale afforestation itc has also reduced
or assessed not by their profit alone
energy and water consumption significantly thereby it has achieved
triple bottom line success in a larger way
to conclude, the triple bottom line approach
focuses on profit, people,
and planet and this approach
has significantly changed the way businesses
assess their performance tbl needs long-term commitment
and innovation by the organizations
the measurement of people and profit dimension
poses a big challenge to organizations adopting tbl
but also by their sustainability solutions
however, the framework is quite flexible
to incorporate the specific needs of the organizations
therefore, the tbl framework amidst its challenges,
enables organizations to have sustainable growth in the long run
in the next video, we will discuss about
ways and means of enhancing sustainability in organizations
thank you
two other bottom lines, namely,
societal and environmental impacts have been brought in
to assess the performance of companies along with profits
the triple bottom line method measures the organization
in terms of social, environment, and economic sustainability
the phrase, people, planet, and profit best describes
the triple bottom line and the goal of sustainability
the term triple bottom line was first coined by john elkington in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four
how sustainability initiatives of the organizations can be measured and reported
and reported further in his book cannibals with forks,
the triple bottom line of twenty-one st century business in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine
today, many non-profit, profit, and government sectors
have started using triple bottom line to assess their performance
the concept of (tbl) as it is defined seems
easier to understand, but it is tough to practice
because measuring the dimensions of people
and the planet is quite difficult
profit could be measured in terms of rupee or dollar value
but how could social health or environmental health
all of us are aware that traditionally
of organizations be measured
global reporting initiative (gri) has developed
guidelines to enable businesses
to report and measure their social environment and economic impact
let us now, further discuss the three dimensions of tbl
number one social dimension
the social or the people bottom line addresses the interaction
with human capital by organizations
according to the social bottom line,
the businesses need to consider the interest
businesses were judged by the financial profits they make
and well being of all people connected with them
people can include, the raw material suppliers,
labour, top management, and other stakeholders
companies with societal interest
try to give back to the community also
following are some examples
of how businesses could score on social sustainability,
not employing child labour, providing
a safe work environment for workers,
adopting fair hiring policies,
in traditional accounting, they used to describe profit or loss
provision of adequate health care to staff,
ensuring fair salaries to workers,
providing opportunities for training and development,
and not practicing any form of human trafficking
would enhance the social score of businesses
however, it is quite difficult to measure this dimension
as it is more subjective in nature
the (gri) has developed guidelines
in order to enable businesses to report
and measure their social impact
of the businesses as the bottom line as it used to appear
the second one is environmental sustainability
the environment or planet bottom line
refers to the natural capital
and the sustainable environmental practices followed by the organizations
environment sustainability refers to managing,
monitoring, and reporting the consumption of resources,
waste, and emissions companies focusing on this aspect
recognize the need for 'going green'
which would provide them with profitability in the long run
following are a few planet- friendly practices,
at the end of the profit and loss account
using renewable energy, recycling of waste materials,
reuse of materials, safe disposal of toxic materials,
reduced carbon and other hazardous gas emission,
and limited use of water and other natural resources
the last dimension of tbl is economic sustainability
the economic or profit bottom line deals with
the economic value created by the organization
after deducting the cost of all inputs
it is not the 'profit' as per traditional accounting
rather, it is the real economic impact
and only one bottom line, that is profits was considered
created by the organization on its economic environment
following are few sustainable economic practices:
helping local suppliers stay in businesses,
focus on overall supply chain profitability,
fair payment to employees,
the right choice of input materials
having seen, the three dimensions of tbl
let us also discuss the benefits of tbl
this approach ensures transparency and accountability of the organization
it builds reputation among consumers and the general public
to be the driving force for any businesses
tbl, enhances productivity and reduces operating costs
it provides competitive advantage to the organization
it enables to retain the best talented workforce
and provides avenues for new markets
it further helps in increasing market share
and encourages corporate social
responsibility reporting having seen the benefits,
let us discuss a real case example
that has used tbl approach
the multi-business player itc delivers a triple-bottom-line
but due to legal and government pressures, organizations today
leading to a forecast error which may cause the bull whip effect
this may have an impact or effect on the demand of the supply chain
hence, the demand for a product is based
on the influence of several factors like
past data, lead time, promotions, economic conditions,
pricing policy, competition, supply situation and their interrelationship
knowledge about the market and environment
will help the supply chain manager in making a good forecasting decision
forecast has two components,
systematic component and a random component
let us have an introduction to supply chain
a systematic component measures the expected demand
and uses the trend and seasonality of the demand in forecasting
whereas, a random component
measures the fluctuations in demand
from the expected value of demand by analyzing the uncontrollable factors
and estimating the forecasting error
which is a very important input
to the supply chain managers in forecasting demand
in this episode, we have discussed
the role of forecasting in supply chain
the supply chain involves in moving around materials
and understood the characteristic of forecasting
in the next episode, we will discuss the different forecasting methods
thank you
music
from the supplier point to the customer point through the intermediaries
in a cost-effective manner to satisfy the customer
in this process we can visualize information flow, fund flow,
material flow, across the supply chain in both directions
the primary objective of the supply chain
is to satisfy the customer needs and generate profit
supply chain management is the set of activities
involved in efficiently integrating the suppliers,
demand forecasting in a supply chain
manufacturers, warehouses, and stores
so that the products which are produced
are distributed at the right quantities,
to the right locations, at the right time
in order to minimize the system wide costs
while satisfying the service level requirements
of each member in the supply chain to meet the customer expectations
having known what supply chain is about,
let us look into the role of forecasting in supply chain
a good and accurate forecast will determine
the learning objectives are: to discuss the significance of demand
how much inventory a company can keep
at various supply and demand points along its supply chain
it helps in making decisions on the quantity
and time of continuous replenishment
sharing of updated information continuously across the supply chain
improves the demand planning process of the supply chain
a good forecast reduces the level of inventory maintained
with the manufacturer and typically follows
vendor management inventory system
and reduces the cost of the supply chain
and supply planning in a supply chain,
this helps the company to follow 'just in time inventory'
an accurate forecast helps in planning
the lead time appropriately
and delivers the product on time to the customer
let us take an example of a supply chain
of the retail giant reliance mart
when you look into the supply chain of reliance mart,
we can understand that the demand from the customer
and is captured by the retail outlet
and shared with the distribution center or the central warehouse
to understand the decisions to be taken during the demand planning process,
then the central warehouse translates this demand
to the downstream members of the supply chain towards the suppliers
this helps the members of the supply chain
to plan their manufacturing and supply
according to the requirement of the customers at the right time
the decisions of the members of this supply chain
are based on the demand of the customer
the demand for certain products are high
whereas the customer pulls the product from the system
when the demand for the product is low,
third, to discuss the tools which are used in demand planning
the products are push from the system to the customer
whether it is a pull product or a push product
the supply chain has to estimate the demand for the products
which is important for the supply chain manager
a supply chain manager can estimate the future forecast based on the past data
with the past data he can predict/estimate the future demand,
which is known as the forecast of demand
when the demand is stable,
forecasting the demand becomes easy,
whereas if the demand is not stable
the learning outcomes: to understand the importance of demand
then a good forecast is needed
for the efficient demand planning of the supply chain
having understood what is the role of forecast in supply chain
let us look at the characteristics of a forecast
the characteristics or forecast can be one
the demand uncertainty, which we call it as the forecast error
which is the key input to the supply chain decisions
take the example of reliance mart
the store manager forecast the demand for a product
based on the past data and with his experience in the store
and supply planning in a supply chain,
but that forecast may not be accurate
as there may be many uncontrollable factors
affecting the demand leading to a forecasting error
this is an important characteristic of forecast
which may affect the supply chain decision
second, the long term forecast is less accurate
when compare to the short term forecast which is more accurate
in reliance mart, weekly forecast of demand will be more accurate
than a monthly forecast of demand,
which may help in improving the efficiency of the supply chain
to understand the decisions to be taken during demand planning process,
third characteristic, aggregate forecast
is more accurate than the disaggregate forecast for a supply chain
for example, in the supply chain of reliance mart,
if the forecast of the retail outlet is shared with the
upstream members and downstream members to make a total forecast by them,
it will be more accurate than an independent forecast of each member
four characteristics, longer the supply chain of a company
greater the distortion of information resulting in forecast error
example, the reliance mart supply chain, if the supply chain is longer
there is always a chance of distortion of information
third, the knowledge on the tools used in demand planning
music
whereas long-range forecast will encompass a period of time
which is longer than two years
demand behavior can be categorized as a trend,
random variation, cyclical and seasonal pattern
the trend behavior is defined as a gradual,
long-term up or down movement of demand
random variations are defined as the movement in demand
that do not follow a specific pattern
cyclic behaviour is defined as an
up-and-down repetitive movement in demand
in the last episode we have discussed
seasonal pattern of behavior is defined as an up-and-down
repetitive movement of demand occurring periodically
forecasting methods can be categorized into
qualitative and quantitative methods
qualitative forecast methods are subjective in nature
they use judgment, intuition, expertise opinion to produce
quantitative estimates of the future demand
when historical data is not available
this method is used to estimate the future demand
experts who have good market knowledge
the role of forecasting in supply chain and its characteristics
intelligence make such decisions
quantitative forecast methods are objective in nature
and are based on numerical data and application of mathematical formulas
they are classified as
time series analysis, casual analysis and simulation analysis
let us look into the time series analysis
when historical data are available,
we use time series analysis
to estimate the demand for a short term period six months,
which will be accurate
in this episode we will discuss about the different forecasting methods
time series is a statistical technique that uses
historical demand data to predict future demand
time series assumes that the environment and factors of consideration
which has occurred in the past
will continue to remain the same in the future too
it relates the forecast to only one factor that is time
this method is widely used
since it is simple and easy to forecast the demand
linear trend line method moving average method exponential smoothing
or few time series analysis methods which are used in forecasting
the different types of forecasting methods
linear trend is a technique which fits a linear trend line
using a mathematical equation involving the independent variable
and the dependent variable with constants
a moving average is an indicator that shows
the average value over a period of time
simple moving averages apply
equal weight to the data over a period of time
exponential smoothing is a moving average method
which applies more weight to recent data
over the time period of forecast to forecast the demand
depend on the time frame, demand behavior and causes of behavior
casual analysis: a casual method of forecasting
uses the relationship between the various demand
factors of supply chain and their relationship to estimate the demand for the future
this method would be a good forecasting method
for a medium to long term period
this method is prone to substantial forecasting error
correlation and regression methods are used to estimate
the future demand under this method
correlation is a measure of the strength of the relationship between
independent and dependent variable
time frame indicates how far into the future is the forecast
whereas, regression method is an attempt
to develop a mathematical relationship
between demand and factors that cause its behavior
linear regression is a mathematical technique
that relates a dependent variable
to an independent variable in the form of a linear equation
simulation analysis: this method imitates the situation
and predicts the demand for the future
algorithms are formulated to estimate the future demand
another important characteristics of forecasting is the forecasting error,
which can be short range, medium range and long range based on it
which we have discussed earlier
when the future forecast is not
perfectly estimated based on past data,
the future forecast will have an error to some degree
the error in the forecast is referred to as forecast error
which is the difference between the forecast and the actual
mathematically forecast error is given by <eqn>et is equal to ft minus
dt, where et is the forecast error in period t </eqn>
ft is the forecasted demand in period t
and dt is the actual demand in period t
short or mid-range forecast typically encompasses
by using this, we calculate or estimate
the forecast error and apply the same in forecasting the demand
in this episode, we have discussed the different types of forecasting methods
in the next step, we will discuss the steps involved in forecasting
thank you
the immediate future, which may be from daily up to two years time period
the second step is to collect the data and analyze
collecting historical data on the demand, supply, lead time,
pricing, inventory, competitive product, competitors share in the market,
and economic environment will help the supply chain manager
to use an analyze the data for appropriate forecast
third step, is to identify the appropriate forecasting method to be used
the supply chain manager should understand the dimensions
that are relevant to the forecast
which may have an impact on the demand of the product
based on the dimensions to be analyzed an appropriate
in the last two episodes, we have discussed
forecasting method has to be selected
from the methods discussed earlier
it may be quantitative or qualitative methods
the next step is to compute the forecast
a supply chain manager should use the data available
and compute the forecast for the dimensions
chosen using the appropriate forecast method
after computing the forecast,
we have to check for the forecast accuracy
once the forecast is made, the supply chain manager
the role of forecasting in supply chain and the different forecasting methods
has to check for the impact of forecast error on the forecast accuracy
if suitable adjustments have to be made
based on the forecast error
the adjustments needed are done to have a good forecast
music
forecast for the planning horizon
once the forecast adjustment is done,
then the forecast is done for the total planning horizon,
so that the forecast for the demand of the product is done
based on the results,
in this episode, we will discuss about the steps in forecasting
the supply chain manager monitors the results
and its accuracy to improve the efficiency of the supply chain
next, we discuss the risk management in forecasting
error in forecasting may have significant impact on the supply chain
at the planning stage and the operational stage
at the planning stage, plans are prepared based on the forecasting
relating to the sourcing decisions,
inventory to be stored, products to be produced,
transportation requirement based on the numbers and the pricing strategy
at the operational stage,
the first step in forecasting is to identify the need of forecast
the day to day activities depend on the accurate forecast
as this may affect the members of the supply chain
hence, an accurate forecast will lead to
effective functioning of the supply chain
the forecast error is a risk in demand planning
longer lead times, seasonality of the products,
shorter life cycle of the product,
catering to a niche market, etc, are the factors leading to the forecast error
creating the risk in demand planning
to manage the risks two strategies can be adopted by the supply chain manager,
in a supply chain, there are number of channel members,
namely increased responsiveness of the supply chain and pooling of demand
increased responsiveness means
the supply chain is needed to invest in creating additional capacity
in meeting the demand faster to reduce the forecasting errors
and the risks associated with it
pooling of demand helps the supply chain to smoothen the fluctuating demand
arising from multiple sources
in avoiding the forecasting error and the risks associated with it
implementing of these two strategies would add to the cost of the supply chain
hence, the supply chain manager has to understand the market thoroughly
every member of the channel has a need on the forecasting information
and use these strategies to offset the forecast errors
and the risks leading to an improved supply chain
it plays a very important role in forecasting
the role of (it) can be discuss further
forecasting software is important in a supply chain
each company uses different algorithms in the demand planning module
a good algorithm always helps the supply chain
to forecast the demand accurately and share information across the supply chain
the software also supports what if analysis
to support planning to take care of and toward eventualities
it becomes important to understand the requirement
summary
we have discussed the significance of forecasting in supply chain
and the tools which are used in forecasting the demand
we understand that collaboration among the members of the supply chain
in building a forecast will give more accurate
forecast of demand across the supply chain
the process may take time in making the partners in the supply chain
to understand and work together
but the outcome of such collaborations is always fruitful
a good forecast will help the supply chain manager
of the members of the supply chain and share it to them
to plan the demand and supply effectively
to achieve the efficiency of the supply chain
in this module, we have discussed the various steps involved in forecasting
we will come again with another module on supply chain
thank you
music
once we share the information,
aggregate planning in a supply chain the learning objectives of
in aggregate planning and the methods of solving an aggregate
planning problem let us have an introduction to supply chain
supply chain involves in moving materials from the supplier
point to the customer point to the intermediaries in a cost
effective manner to satisfy the customer in this process, we
can visualize information flow, fund flow, and material flow
across the supply chain in both directions the primary
objective of the supply chain is to satisfy the customer needs
and generate profit a supply chain management is the set of
activities involved in efficiently integrating the
this module are: to understand the concept of aggregate
suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses and stores so that
the products which are produced are distributed at the right
quantities to the right location and at the right time, in order
to minimize the system wide costs while satisfying the
service level requirements of each member in the supply chain
to meet the customer expectations let us now
understand what aggregate planning is? aggregate planning
is the process of planning the quantity and timing of output
over an intermediate time horizon say six to twelve
months period in a manufacturing plant it involves adjusting the
planning, to analyze the role of aggregate planning in supply
controllable variables to respond to forecast and order
fluctuations in a rational manner what should be the
capacity of a plant to meet the fluctuating demand? should the
company decide the capacity based on this demand or plan
for average demand and satisfy the demand using other resources
like subcontracting or inventory holding these questions arise to
a manufacturing plant holding inventory during less demand
period and using the accumulated stock during the peak period
demand will be an option allowing stock out and making the
customer to wait till the next period and then satisfying his
chain, to understand the information needed for aggregate
demand may be another option aggregate planning analyzes this
situation and determines the quantity required in terms of
capacity of the plant, production, subcontracting,
inventory and stock outs in meeting the demand of the supply
chain the basic objective of the aggregate planning is to
satisfy the demand at the lowest cost and maximize the profit of
the manufacturing company let us now discuss on the role of
aggregate planning in supply chain aggregate planning is the
planning process followed in a manufacturing company in a
supply chain to satisfy the fluctuating demand the company
planning process, to learn the various strategies in aggregate
uses the controllable variables of production process, capacity,
workforce, inventory, subcontracting, back ordering to
cater to the demand since the process of aggregate planning is
associated with manufacturing plant, will this impact the
supply chain? yes, it will have an impact on the supply chain the
downstream and upstream partners of the supply chain are going to
have an impact because of the collaborative forecast where
they do in determining the demand for the supply chain to
increase its efficiency the demand of the downstream members
of the supply chain determines the forecast of the production
planning, to understand the different methods of aggregate
plan the production plan of a manufacturing company will
define the demand of this supplier of the supply chain
hence, the aggregate plan of a manufacturing company in the
supply chain impacts the entire supply chain processes
the controllable variables which are used in aggregate planning
are: capacity, workforce, time, inventory, subcontracting, back
ordering the aggregate plan is prepared using the various
variables allowing the supply chain to alter the capacity
allocation, supply contracts, inventory stocked, inventory moved,
labor employed etc, to satisfy the demand of the supply chain
planning process, to formulate and solve a basic aggregate
this plan which is done by the manufacturer should be shared
with the members of the supply chain suppliers, transporters
warehouse and the retailers to incorporate the changes needed
in their plans, which will optimize the supply chain
performance hence, coordination of the members of the supply
chain becomes important lack of coordination among the members
will lead to shortages or oversupply in the supply chain
resulting in the inefficiency of the supply chain therefore, we
understand that an aggregate plan plays a very important role
across the supply chain what are the informations which are
planning problem using an example the learning outcomes
needed for an aggregate plan? an aggregate plan is prepared to
satisfy the fluctuating demand using the controllable variables
over an intermediate time period so to prepare the plan
the following information are needed: demand forecast for the
time period, details about the production costs like regular
time production cost, overtime production cost, hiring cost,
layoff cost of the labours, machine hours required for
production, inventory carrying cost, stock out cost or back
ordering cost, constraints on the controllable variables if any
then limitations on inventory, safety stock, workforce,
are: an understanding of aggregate planning and its role
overtime, stock quotes, supply contracts, capital constraints
etc should be known when we do the process of aggregate
production planning in this episode, we have discussed the
role of aggregate production planning in supply chain and
understanding of what aggregate production planning are in the
next episode, we will discuss about the aggregate planning
strategies thank you
in supply chain we should have learnt the various strategies
music
method one is a graphical and charting techniques,
music
method two is the mathematical approach,
music
under the mathematical approach, we have transportation methods,
music
linear decision rules, linear programming and simulation
music
the graphical approach to aggregate planning
music
music
is simple
music
steps involved in the graphical approach are given below:
music
first step is to forecast the demand for each period
music
second step is to determine the capacity
for regular time production, overtime production and subcontracting
music
the most profitable combination of variables will be used
third step is to determine the labor cost,
music
hiring and firing cost and inventory holding costs
music
the next step is to consider the company policy which may apply to the workers
music
or to the inventories
music
then based on the all information available,
music
music
our aggregate production plan is prepared
and compared with the total cost of various alternates
which are available and the best plan is selected for implementation
music
mathematical techniques:
music
an aggregate planning problem
can be formulated as the linear programming problem
with the objective function of maximizing profit
supply_chain_management_6458
to achieve this goal
or minimizing cost with the constraints
music
solving this linear programming problem
will optimize the decision and give the projection of
various quantities to be produced
music
to satisfy the demand
music
similarly, an aggregate production planning problem
can be formulated as a transportation model
music
music
and solved
music
the capacity and the demand constraints are taken as
demand and supply for a transportation problem
music
the unit cost of manufacturing
music
using different controllable variables
music
basically, a company attempts to use a combination of
are taken as unit cost of transportation
of a transportation problem
music
solving this problem and finding the optimum allocation
music
will give us the solution for the aggregate production problem,
which has been taken for consideration
music
similarly, simulation is used as a method of solving
in aggregate planning
three variables, namely
music
an aggregate planning problem can be developed into a simulation model
with an environment and tested under various conditions to find the
music
suitable production plan for implementation
music
the models developed
music
can be part of the decision support system
of the organization
music
music
which will help them in planning
and analyzing the various options in aggregate planning
music
with the inputs from all stakeholders
music
this type of simulation models will help the manufacturing plant
to formulate an appropriate manufacturing strategy
music
to meet the demand of the supply chain
capacity, inventory, and back ordering
music
in this episode, we have discussed
the various methods of aggregate production planning
music
in the next episode, we will discuss
music
an example of aggregate production planning in supply chain management
thank you
music
in the last episode, we have discussed
if a company uses only one variable
in preparing the aggregate plan, it is called as pure strategy
music
but when a company uses more than one variable
in preparing an aggregate plan, it is called as a mixed strategy
music
mixed strategy can be: chase strategy,
cpacity strategy or a level strategy
music
now, let us discuss about the various mixed strategies
the role of aggregate planning in supply chain
music
chase strategy:
music
this strategy in aggregate planning
focuses on meeting the required demand
music
by varying the capacity and the workforce size for the respective periods
music
when this strategy is employed, the workforce will be hired
when the demand increases for that period
music
music
and the workforce will be laid off
when the demand decreases for that period
music
similarly, the capacity of production is also varied as per their demand
music
capacity strategy:
music
this strategy in aggregate planning
focuses on meeting the demand
in this episode we will discuss
music
by planning a constant workforce
for the available capacity and uses time as a variable
to meet the increase in demand
music
when the demand increases, the manufacturer works for overtime
music
to meet the demand of that period
but when the demand decreases,
music
about the different aggregate planning strategies
the manufacturer works with less number of machines
to meet the demand for that period, resulting in idle time for the capacity
music
this strategy is more practically
music
used than the chase strategy,
music
as varying the workforce size will lead to lower morale
among the workforce and may affect the productivity of the organization
music
in preparing the aggregate plan, the planner makes a trade off
the third strategy is known as the level strategy
music
this strategy in aggregate planning focuses on meeting their demand
by planning a constant workforce and the constant capacity
to meet the demand requirements
music
when the demand is low,
music
extra production is accumulated as inventory and used later
music
among the various variables
if the demand is high,
music
the demand is met with the accumulated inventory
music
if the accumulated inventory is not
enough to meet the demand,
music
then the manufacturer uses back ordering strategy
and makes the customer wait for the product till the next period
music
music
so that the production of next period
fulfills the demand for the
music
next requirement of the supply chain
music
methods of preparing an aggregate plan
music
there are two methods of preparing
music
an aggregate plan:
to optimize the cost
music
in this example, the total production hours
required is equal to sixteen thousand into five
and the total production hours available is equal to one hundred and twenty-five days into eight
the calculation goes like this eighty thousand divided by one thousand
which results in the requirement of eighty workers
we then calculate the number of units produced with eighty workers for every month
units produced every month is equal to
production hours available per worker multiplied by eighty
music
divided by production hours required per unit of production
which is wishing to set up a production plan for a period of six months
once this is calculated, then we calculate the cumulative production required
and the cumulative number of units produced
every month as shown in the table
based on this data, find out
if there is a surplus or shortage of production,
which is calculated by the difference between production required
and units produced for each and every month
if production required is higher than units produced,
then we have a shortage
if production required is less than the units produced, then we have a surplus
the information regarding the demand and the number of working days
based on this, we calculate the surplus cost and shortage cost
for finding out the total cost for this plan
the total cost for this plan is found out by adding
material cost, labour cost, inventory carrying cost,
surplus cost and shortage cost
plan 3:
plan three is to meet the minimum expected demand
using a constant workforce on regular time for there data given
here we are expected to subcontract additional output requirement
if there is a shortage during the month
for a period of six months is given in the following table
minimum expected demand is during april
for the demand in april, we have to calculate the men required
men required is equal to production hours required in april
divided by production hours available in april
which is equal to eight thousand, five hundred divided by one hundred and sixty-eight
which results in fifty-one men approximately
the company has fifty-one workers for the entire period of six months
based on this, we then calculate the number of units produced
every month with the fifty-one workers available
then find out the units produced per month
the other details of the process of manufacturing is also given
whether it satisfies the production required
if units produced is more than the requirement,
we have a surplus production,
which is carried to the next month as an inventory
if the units produced is less than the production required,
we subcontract the shortage units to satisfy the demand for that month
using this procedure for the six months period,
we calculate the surplus cost and the subcontracting cost
for calculating the total cost
total cost for this plan will be equal to material cost
the material cost is rupees one hundred per unit,
plus labour cost plus inventory carrying cost
plus surplus cost plus subcontracting cost
we have planned the production based on the three plans given
we have to compare the cost of the three plans and we choose the optimal
total cost plan as the best aggregate planning strategy
to satisfy the demand of the company
hence, to improve the profitability of the supply chain
summary: in this edition, we have discussed
the significance of aggregate planning in supply chain
and the methods used in aggregate planning
inventory holding cost is rupees three per unit per month
we understand that aggregate plan
has a significant impact on a supply chain
a good aggregate plan which is done in collaboration
with the supply chain partners
will lead to an accurate plan for all the members of the supply chain
the shared outcome of the aggregate plan among the members
of the supply chain will help them to anticipate the demand
and to the customers it will help them to get a planned supply
a good appropriate plan will help the supply chain manager
to plan the demand and supply effectively to achieve efficiency of the supply chain
the marginal cost of stockout is rupees ten per unit per month
we will come with another episode till then
thank you
music
marginal cost of subcontracting is rupees forty per unit,
hiring and training cost is rupees four hundred per worker
layoff cost is rupees five hundred per worker,
in the last two episodes, we have discussed
labour hours required per unit is five hours
regular time cost is rupees six per hour,
overtime cost is rupees eight per hour,
beginning inventory is eight hundred units,
safety stock to be maintained
is twenty-five percent of the monthly demand
based on the given data about the demand, the number of working days,
safety inventory required and the production details,
we have to prepare the actual production required
for the six periods of demand given
the role of aggregate planning in supply chain
the actual production is calculated based on the inventory on hand
and the safety inventory to be maintained
actual production required is equal to
demand minus inventory on hand
plus safety stock to be maintained
using this, we prepare the actual production required
the safety stock maintained for january
will become the inventory on hand for the subsequent month february
continue the same process
to get the actual production for the six months period
and the different aggregate planning strategies
once the actual production required is calculated,
we can work on the different plans
plan 1: produce exactly to the monthly requirements
using a regular time production
by varying the workforce size
to produce exactly to the monthly requirements,
we follow the steps below
first, calculate the production hours required every month
then calculate the production hours required,
which is equal to production units required for the month
in this episode, we will discuss
multiplied by production hours required per unit
then calculate the production hours available per month
production hours available per month is equal to
number of working days available per month
multiplied by production hours available per day
based on the above calculations,
we can find out the men required for that particular month
the men required for any month is equal to
production hours required that month
divided by production hours available that month
music
we calculate the men required for all the six months period
based on the above calculation
when we start production we assume that
we have the required manpower to work
in this example, we have one hundred and six men
for the second month, the men required is ninety-four
so we layoff twelve workers during the second month
for the third month, the men required is sixty
we layoff thirty-four workers for the third month
for the fourth month, demand required is fifty-one
an example of aggregate planning in supply chain
we layoff nine workers for the fourth month
for the fifth month, the men required is sixty-six
we hire fifteen workers for the fifth month
for the sixth month, the men required is one hundred and eight
so we hire forty-two workers for the sixth month
once we have calculated the men required for various periods
based on the above calculation,
we find out the cost of layoff
and the cost of hiring for every month
depending upon whether the men are laid off or men are hired
we are going to use the graphical technique
as per the cost data given in the problem
hiring cost is equal to men hired
multiplied by cost per men hired
layoff cost is equal to men laid off
multiplied by cost per men laid off
after calculating this we can calculate the total cost
the total cost is depending on material cost,
labour cost, inventory carrying cost, hiring cost and layoff cost
total cost is equal to material cost plus labour cost
plus inventory carrying cost plus hiring cost and layoff cost
in solving the aggregate planning in the supply chain
plan 2: plan two is to produce
to meet the expected average demand
over the six months period
by maintaining a constant workforce
inventory is allowed to accumulate with shortages
filled from the next month's production by back ordering
constant workforce based on the average demand
over the period of six months is to be calculated,
which is equal to the total production hours required
that month divided by total production hours available
we take an example of a company in a supply chain
managing supply and demand learning objectives:
the supply chain involves in moving materials from the
supplier point to the customer point through the intermediaries
in a cost effective manner to satisfy the customer in this
process, we can visualize the information flow, fund flow and
material flow across the supply chain in both directions the
primary objective of supply chain is to satisfy the customer
needs and generate profit in a supply chain, we have discussed
in the previous modules, how demand forecasting and aggregate
planning plays a very important role in meeting the expected
demand of the supply chain when the demand is stable, it is
to understand the concept of predictive variability, to
simple and easy to prepare the aggregate plan but when the demand
is not stable, the process becomes difficult and complex in
preparing the aggregate plan the variability in the expected
demand may be due to a number of factors like seasonal factors
and non-seasonal factors, which may be price promotion and time
this variability may have an impact on the supply chain in
meeting the expected demand hence, it is important to
understand the concept of predictive variability what is
predictive variability? predictive variability is
defined as the change in demand, which can be forecasted and met
analyze the impact of predictive variability in a supply chain, to
by proper planning of supply and demand management across the
supply chain what is the impact of predictive variability in a
supply chain? normally, manufacturers plan for a
constant capacity and produce the products accordingly when
we look into the products, which have seasonal demand, the
manufacturer in the supply chain faces a tough situation in
planning the production as the demand in the peak period is
high leading to stock out situation and during non-peak
period the demand is low leading to accumulation of inventory
these situations are a challenge for the manufacturer to satisfy
understand the approaches in managing the supply in a supply
the demand across the supply chain similarly, when a
retailer offers a promotion, the demand for a product is likely
to increase this increase in demand is not anticipated by the
manufacturer as he may not know the promotion offer given by
the retailer leading to short supply from the manufacturer
when a manufacturer uses a pricing strategy, to push the
product into the market, the demand is likely to increase as
the customer would want to get the price advantage this also
increases the demand and will have a significant impact on the
members of the supply chain, especially the supply side
chain, to understand the approaches in managing the demand in a
in both the situations, an increase in sales will result in more
profit to manage such situations, it is always better
to have an informed and collaborative decision across
the members of the supply chain which will help the supply chain
to improve its efficiency
the variability in demand which is cost across the supply chain
affects them and it can be offset by proper supply
management and demand management let us discuss them
in detail one by one supply management: when there is
variation in demand the manufacturing company in a
supply chain the learning outcomes are: to have a basic
supply chain can meet the fluctuating demand using two
strategies, namely production capacity strategy and inventory
strategy let us discuss the production capacity strategy by
varying the production capacity the manufacturer can meet the
change in demand either by increase in production or by
decrease in production increase in production capacity may be
with additional capacity when there is a increase in demand is
consistent over a period of time or if the increase in
demand is only for a short period, then the manufacturer
uses overtime or subcontracting as a strategy to offset the
understanding on the impact of variability in demand, to know
demand when the demand decreases, then the manufacturer
reduces the production by laying off the workforce to match the
demand resulting in ideal capacity this strategy helps
the company to minimize the cost and optimize the profit of the
supply chain in this episode, we have discussed what is the
impact of predictive variability on the supply chain and a basic
introduction to supply management in the next episode,
we will discuss the different approaches in supply management
in supply chain thank you
the various approaches in managing the supply in supply
chain, to know the various approaches in managing the
demand in a supply chain introduction to supply chain
with different designs, we cannot use the above approach in meeting the demand
in such cases, the manufacturer is forced to stock
inventory in all the different types of products manufactured by them
this results in building large quantity of inventory
to meet the fluctuating demand
music
the manufacturing of a supply chain uses a
combination of strategies discussed about
to manage the supply in meeting the change in demand
to increase the efficiency of the supply chain
flexible workforce and overtime, seasonal workforce,
in this episode we have discussed
the various supply approaches
which are used in supply chain to manage the supply
in the next episode we will discuss
the process of demand management in supply chain
thank you
outsourcing, dual facility, flexible production lines
flexible workforce and overtime
this approach is used by the manufacturer,
when the workforce is flexible to the working hours
many companies work for one shift of eight hours duration
and plan their production capacity according to meet the demand
when the demand increases marginally
these companies can extend their working hours
depending upon the production required in meeting the demand
in the last episode we have discussed
the extended time is considered as overtime
and the workforce is paid wages accordingly
if the increase in demand is too high,
the manufacturer plans for a second shift
and employs part time workers to meet the demand
in the same way, if the demand decreases,
production capacity is reduced
and the workforce is given a layoff
this approach can be used on a daily basis
or on a weekly basis or on a monthly basis
the impact of supply and demand management in supply chain
to meet the required demand
the second strategy in capacity is seasonal workforce
manufacturers plan for a constant production capacity
based on the average demand over a period of time with stable workforce
when the demand increases during peak season,
the manufacturer employs
part time workers during this season on a temporary basis
to offset the peak season demand
this helps the manufacturer in managing their supply
across the supply chain in meeting the varying demand
in this episode we will discuss about the different approaches
the next capacity strategy is outsourcing
manufacturer outsources the production during peak season
to manage their supply to meet the varying demand
the manufacturer production remains constant over a period of time
the change in demand is outsourced from a chosen vendor
who supplies the product at lower cost
the use of this approach depends on the availability of sub contractors
who have the capacity and have flexibility
over the quantity required to meet the demand
when such sub contractors are available,
in supply management in supply chain
their relationship is more important
for the success of this approach in meeting the varying demand
dual facility is another capacity approach in meeting to demand
some manufacturers who are original equipment manufacturers a companies
and have specialization in manufacturing certain products
establish two production facility
one production facility is to cater to the
original equipment manufacturers requirement,
and another production facility is to cater to the other companies
which require similar products with different specification
approaches in supply management
of the same product family
under these circumstances,
when the demand for the oem's increase,
they use the second facility to support the increase in demand
over a period of time
hence, dual facility of manufacturer
helps them to offset the supply requirements
flexible production lines are another capacity strategy
which is used by the manufacturer to meet the varying demand
this approach is used when the manufacturer has a number of production lines
in managing the variation in demand,
catering to a range of products
belonging to a particular category or product family
under this circumstance, this manufacturer can use
additional production line
to meet the increase in demand for a particular product
if the demand decreases, the production line of the product
is used for manufacturing other products of the company which has a demand
hence, product flexible production lines
are used as a capacity strategy for managing the fluctuating demand
another strategy which is used by the
the manufacturer uses a combination of
company as a capacity strategy is inventory
inventory can be used as a strategy for meeting the
fluctuating demand across the supply chain
in managing the variation in demand,
the manufacturer uses a combination
of inventory approaches to manage the supply
the approaches used by the manufacturer are
using common components and building inventory
a manufacturer who manufactures number of products
in the product category uses
capacity approaches to manage the supply
the approach of using common components to meet the fluctuating demand
this type of manufacturer has to design the products
in such a way that they have common components
when they have such products
these manufacturers have the options of manufacturing the common components
in bulk quantity and maintain an inventory, which can be used
at the time of varying demand of various products
this helps the manufacturer to offset the demand across the supply chain
and improve its efficiency
but if the manufacturer has different types of products
the approaches used by the manufacturer are:
in the last two episodes, we have discussed the impact of
retailers in the supply chain use promotion as a strategy to
increase the sales of products
the decision taken by the retailer on promotion is not a
collaborative decision and hence the members of the supply
chain may not be aware of such a move
when such decisions are made by the retailer, it will have an
impact on the members of the supply chain as the promotion
offered by the retailer will increase the sales
when sales increases, the retailer expects the stocks to
be refilled this increase in demand may not be anticipated by
supply and demand management in supply chain and the different
the warehouse or the members of the supply chain resulting in a
stock out situation
hence in managing the demand during such situation, it is
advised that the retailers discuss the promotion offer and
the timing of the offer with the members of the supply chain and
take a collaborative decision, which will help the members of the
supply chain to be prepared to meet the varying or increase in
demand
similarly, when the manufacturer is willing to offer price
discounts on products, it should be discussed with the members of
approaches of supply management in supply chain in this episode
the supply chain as the price discounts will have an impact on
the demand hence, the members of the supply chain are expected
to discuss and decide the pricing strategy and the
promotion strategy to be offered to ease out the production and
supply of products across the supply chain keeping in mind the
production cost and the overall supply chain cost
members also have to discuss on how the profit generated in the
supply chain is to be shared among them to enhance the
efficiency of the supply chain and understanding between the
members will help them to work together better
we will discuss about the approaches in demand management
hence, we understand that when there is a variation in demand,
the manufacturer uses a combination of approaches:
production capacity, inventory and pricing to manage the supply
and demand across the supply chain to maximize its profits
summary: we can understand that to manage the
predictable variation in demand in a supply chain coordination
among the supply chain members is essential
they have to share information across them collaborate to align
in the right direction to meet the demand similarly, a
constant monitoring of the predictive variation will help
in supply chain
the supply chain to make strategic decisions in terms of
capacity enhancement, supplier contracts, pricing strategy to
enhance the responsiveness of the supply chain
the objective of the supply chain is to cater to the demand
of the customer at the lowest cost a supply chain achieves this
by managing the supply and demand across the supply chain
to manage the supply a manufacturer uses: workforce
flexibility, time, outsourcing, dual facility, flexible
production lines to augment the demand to manage the demand
manufacturers use pricing and promotion strategies along with
managing demand
collaborative effort of the supply chain members to augment
the supply
appropriate use of aggregate plan across the supply chain
helps the supply chain to maximize its profitability as
well as meet the fluctuating demand thank you!
promotion and pricing strategies have an impact on the supply
chain and cause a variation in demand across the supply chain
we will discuss how this impact is managed by the supply chain
now
to understand the role and impact of cycle inventory in a supply chain,
to have a thorough knowledge on the various costs
of inventory and its impact on cycle inventory,
to have an understanding the impact of economies of scale on cycle inventory,
understanding the impact of quantity discount,
and trade promotion on cycle inventory and there by supply chain
introduction to supply chain
the supply chain involves in moving materials
from the supplier point to the customer point
through the intermediaries in a cost- effective manner to satisfy the customer
managing economics of scale in supply chain,
in this process we can visualize
information flow, fund flow and material flow
across the supply chain in both directions
the primary objective of the supply chain
is to satisfy the customer needs and generate profit
let us look into the impact of cycle inventory and supply chain
in a supply chain the members in the supply chain
buy more than their requirement to get the benefit of
economies of scale, which lowers their total cost
when such decisions are made by the members they allow
and introduction to you on the impact of cycle inventory
accumulating inventory for a particular cycle
the average inventory maintained by the members of the supply chain
is either due to production or due to purchases
in economic lot sizes that are larger than their requirement,
which is known as cycle inventory
when demand is constant, cycle inventory
and lot sizes are related, where cycle inventory is half of average inventory
let us now discuss, the role of cycle inventory in a supply chain
larger the cycle inventory, longer the lag time
between production of a product and its sales
the learning objectives of this module are:
long time lags make the firm vulnerable
to demand changes of the market place
lower cycle inventory decreases the lag time
and matches with the demand requirement of the market
it also decreases the organization working capital requirement
hence, it is suggested to have a reduced cycle inventory,
but one has to understand the impact of the reduced lot size on the cost
and the performance of the supply chain
cycle inventory is maintained to take advantage of the economies of scale
to reduce the cost across the supply chain
to understand the role of cycle inventory in a supply chain,
the various costs that influence the lot size are average price paid
per unit of the product purchased, fixed costs ordering
and the holding cost
the average price paid by the purchaser
is an important cost in lot size decision
when the purchase price per unit is reduced for an increased lot size,
the buyer may buy more which will affect the lot size and in turn the cycle inventory
the fixed ordering cost includes all the cost
associated with ordering and receiving the material
it remains constant and do not vary with lot sizes
to understand the impact of various costs on determining the optimal inventory,
when lot sizes increases,
fixed ordering cost per unit purchased decreases
this motivates the buyer to buy more
holding cost is the cost of carrying inventory
in stores for a specified period of time, normally it is one year
the holding cost increases with increase in lot size
holding cost is calculated as a percentage of purchase price
when we use economies of scale and buy lot sizes
the lot size to be bought by the buyer is influenced by these three costs
that is purchase price per unit, ordering cost per order
to understand the impact of economies of scale on cycle inventory,
and holding cost per unit per year
the role of cycle inventory is to allow the members in the supply chain
to purchase products in different lot sizes
that minimizes the cost of material, ordering cost and holding cost
if the manager considers the holding cost,
he will reduce the lot size resulting in decrease in cycle inventory
if he considers material and ordering cost,
he will increase the lot size resulting in increase in cycle inventory
hence, a trade off is expected to be made to minimize the total cost,
when making lot size decisions
to understand the impact of quantity discounts,
this lot size decision influences the cycle inventory maintained
across the members of the supply chain
we can understand from the discussion that cycle inventory
exists in a supply chain when the members use economies of scale
to lower the total cost and it plays an important role
in the performance of the supply chain
in this edition, we have discussed the role of cycle inventory in supply chain
in the next edition, we will discuss
the impact of economies of scale on cycle inventory
thank you
and trade promotions on lot size and cycle inventory
music
the learning outcomes are:
in the last edition, we discussed the role of cycle
in this edition, we have discussed the impact of
economies of scale on cycle inventory
in the next edition,
we will discuss the impact of quantity discount
and promotion on cycle inventory and the supply chain impact
thank you!
music
it provides a proportionate savings in costs gained by an
increased level of production so, economies of scale is going
to be advantages for any company
supply chain exploits economies of scale
during its replenishment decision
the decisions
are made under three different conditions:
one: fixed cost is incurred each time
an order is placed or purchased
two: when the supplier offers price discounts
inventory in supply chain
based on the quantity purchased lot
when the supplier offers trade promotions for a
third specified period which is the third option
music
fixed costs associated in buying lot sizes
are associated with placing, receiving
and transportation costs
a purchase manager looks at minimizing the total cost
in satisfying the demand in making the appropriate trade off
among the costs when making the lot size decision
in this edition we will discuss the
music
let us take an example of lot sizing for a single product
when buying a single product, the purchase
manager makes the lot sizing decision based on the following assumptions
the assumptions are: demand and lead time are known
and constant, replenishment of stock is instantaneous,
and no quantity discount is available
music
under such conditions, if the following inputs are available,
we calculate the total cost
impact of economies of scale on cycle inventory
music
let d be the annual demand,
s be the fixed cost of ordering per order,
c be the cost of the material per unit
and "h" be the percentage of holding cost per unit of the
material cost
then, the total annual cost is calculated by
adding ordering cost plus holding cost plus cost of material
mathematically, total cost is equal to d by q into s
plus q by two into ch plus dc
music
the objective of the manager is to minimize the total costs
by using the maxima, minima rule of differentiation,
when we differentiate the above equation with respect to q
and equating to zero, we get the optimal lot size q star
so, q star is equal to square root of two ds divided by h into c
with each lot size q star, the cycle inventory
will be the average inventory q star by two
when lot sizes increases, cycle inventory increases
music
total ordering cost and holding cost will be same at the point of
economies of scale are cost advantages reaped by companies
economic lot size
an organization may order a convenient lot size
closer to the economic lot size to set the advantage of
the economies of scale
if the demand increases,
the optimal lot size increases where as the flow times decreases
if the demand decreases, the optimal lot size
decreases whereas the flow time increases
when the manager wants to have a desired lot size,
he has to reduce the fixed order cost
when production becomes efficient
to minimize the total cost
music
let us take an another example of getting the total cost benefit
music
it is to aggregate multiple products in a single order
music
to reduce the lot size, the manager has to understand the fixed cost
a major fixed cost is the transportation cost
when a company has an array of products, each product is
managed independently which results in higher fixed cost
it is obtained with the scale of operation
increasing the cycle inventory
so, aggregating orders and delivering across the number of products
will lower the cycle inventories
in this process of aggregating we should consider
the fixed costs of receiving or loading cost
when varieties of products are transported, warehouse has to be
updated with the inventory records of multiple products
received and they should allocate separate space for storing the items
thus when planning for a reduced lot size
we should focus on reducing these costs
with the cost per unit of output
use of appropriate technology
to share electronically details of the suppliers
and the use of rfid technology help them to reduce
the fixed cost of receiving an optimal lot size leading to
reduced cycle inventory
we have discussed how fixed ordering costs
impact on the inventory stocked and the costs in a supply chain
reduction in lot size has to be done with increasing the cost,
reducing the fixed cost associated with each lot by aggregating lots
across multiple products, customers or suppliers
decreasing with increasing scale
cycle inventory generally equals half of the lot size
in determining the optimal quantity of cycle inventory,
the supply chain goal is to minimize the total cost
economic order quantity balances all the cost
associated with the inventory to determine the optimal order size
when order cost and transportation cost increases,
the lot size and cycle inventory increases
lot size based quantity discounts increase the lot size
and cycle inventory in the supply chain as they
encourage buyers to buy larger quantities
second type of discount is based on the total quantity
to take advantage of discounted price
quantity discounts increase total supply chain profits
volume discounts are more effective than lot based discounts
in increasing the supply chain profits
with increasing lot size and cycle inventory
trade promotion increases inventory and the total supply chain cost
through forward buying
the increased inventory increases the cycle inventory
and the flow time
hence, to reduce the lot size and cycle inventory in the
bought over a period of time irrespective of lot size purchased
supply chain without increasing the cost,
a manager has to reduce the fixed ordering cost,
the transportation cost and implement volume based discount schemes
in these modules, we have discussed impact of
the economies of scale on cycle inventory
thank you
music
the lot size discounts are of two types,
all unit quantity discount, and marginal unit quantity discount
all unit quantity discount contains specific break points
with price schedules
for example, a price break for a
different quantity can be as follows:
the quantity can be less than the x unit x one units,
in the last edition, we have discussed the impact of
where the price is p one and quantity between x one to x two
the price may be p two the quantity greater than x two
the price may be p three
based on the above and if the annual demand is "d",
ordering cost is "s", and
percentage of carrying cost is "h", we can calculate the
economic order quantity for the above instances
using all the three prices p one p two p three
we calculate the economic lot size,
which may be economic lot size one corresponding to price p one
economies of scale on cycle inventory
economic lot size two corresponding to p two
economic lot size three corresponding to price p three
the economic lot size calculated thus should be checked
if the value falls in the quantity range offered
only one economic lot size value will fall in the range of the quantity
that economic lot size is the correct economic lot size
for the company
the objective of the manager is to minimize the total cost
we have to calculate the total cost for the economic lot size
when a larger quantity is available for the quantity discount,
in this edition we will discuss the impact of quantity discounts
we have to calculate the total cost of that quantity
and compare with the costs calculated earlier
comparing the cost, the manager selects the lowest total cost option
music
pricing schedules with this type of quantity discounts
encourage retailers to buy large lots to take advantage of the
price discounts
this will increase the cycle inventory
and increase the flow time in a supply chain
music
and promotion on cycle inventory and the supply chain
marginal unit quantity discount model:
this type of quantity discount has a
price schedule for specified break points of quantities
this method uses the marginal cost of a unit at a break point
music
if an order is placed for x quantity, the first range x zero to x one
units are priced at price p one
the next range x one to x two units are
priced at price two p two and it goes so on
the marginal cost per unit varies with quantity purchased
in business to business transactions,
and accordingly the total cost is calculated
as discussed before
music
quantity discounts lead to a significant buildup of cycle inventory
in a supply chain rather than increase the fixed ordering cost
quantity discounts are important in supply chain
to have an improved coordination to increase supply chain profit
and extract the surplus through price discrimination
music
independent decision making on quantity discounts
two types of discounts are offered to the buyers
by the members of the supply chain may benefits
individual members and not the entire supply chain
hence, a coordinated decision among the members of the supply chain
will maximize the total supply chain profits,
when all the members will get benefitted
music
manufacturers use trade promotion to offer a discounted
price at a time when the discount is effective
sometimes they also support retailers
on specific promotions at different period of time during the year
one type of discount is based on the quantity bought per order-
trade promotions influences retailers
to buy more and help the manufacturer to achieve their objectives
of moving the product across the supply chain
when the retailers use the trade promotion he may respond by
passing the total profit or part of the profit to the customer to
increase sales
this action of the retailer leading to increased purchases
increases sales for the entire supply chain
sometimes he may share very little of the promotion to
the customers and build inventory using the reduced price
if you buy more you get a discount
for meeting the future demand this results in increased cycle
inventory and increased flow time within the supply chain
trade promotion leads to a significant increase in lot size
and cycle inventory as the retailers adopt a forward buying strategy
to avail the benefits
this results in reduce supply chain profits
unless the trade promotion reduces the demand fluctuations
music
summary:
music
which is known as lot size discount
as the demand is normalized the service level
can be represented as 'z'
music
the value for 'z' can be calculated from the normal distribution table
and the safety inventory can be calculated accordingly,
where mathematically <eqn>safety inventory will be equal to
z into sigma d into square root of l </eqn>
music
product availability is defined as
the firm's ability to meet the customer demand
music
from the available inventory
if the firm is not able to meet the demand
from the available inventory,
it results in stock out situation
hence, safety inventory helps the firm
to avoid stock out situations
product availability depends on
product fill rate, order fill rate, and cycle service level
music
product fill rate is that part of demand
the learning outcomes of this module are:
which is satisfied from product inventory
music
fill rate is equivalent to the probability of product demand
met from the available inventory
music
order fill rate is that part of orders
which are filled from the available inventory
to have a higher order fill rates
the firm has to stock enough inventories of all products
that the firm produces
to know the role and impact of safety inventory in a supply chain,
music
cycle service level is the that part of the replenishment cycle
which meets the customer demand
a replenishment cycle is the time gap between
two successive order deliveries
cycle service level is the probability of not having
a stock out in a replenishment cycle period
music
the service level can be denoted by 'z' as discussed earlier
music
to have a thorough knowledge on the various factors
in this edition, we have discussed
the role of safety inventory in supply chain
in the next edition, we will discuss the
impact of replenishment policies on safety inventory
thank you
music
influencing safety inventory,
to have a knowledge on different measures for product availability,
to have a knowledge on the various methods available
to lower safety inventory to improve product availability
let us start with an introduction to supply chain
the supply chain involves in moving materials from the supplier
managing uncertainty in a supply chain safety inventory
point to the customer point through the intermediaries
in a cost effective manner to satisfy the customer
in this process we can visualise,
information flow, fund flow, and
material flow across the supply chain in both directions
the primary objective of the supply chain
is to satisfy the customer needs and generate profit
music
introduction to safety inventory
music
learning objectives of this module are:
inventory is the stock maintained in stores to take care of
demand requirements of the production department or
the members in the supply chain to meet the customer requirements
inventory is determined by analyzing the demand rate
and the lead time of the supply
music
when the demand and lead time are constant,
the need for inventory is also known and constant
but when demand and lead time or either one of them varies,
there is a chance of stock out
to understand the role of safety
to offset this situation
an extra quantity of stock more than the forecasted demand is
maintained in stores
this stock is known as safety stock or safety inventory
let us now discuss the role of safety inventory in supply chain
the availability of safety inventory ensures
the product availability under varying demand conditions
to satisfy the customer requirement
though this satisfies the customer requirements,
it increases the amount of inventory held and thereby
inventory in a supply chain,
increases the holding cost
carrying excessive inventory can help to meet the demand variation
but can affect the company,
if new products come into the market,
the existing inventory will become obsolete
and cost the company
music
thus, the key to success of any supply chain will be
to identify the optimum level of inventory to be carried
without affecting the cost, keeping in mind the product availability
to understand the factors
music
in planning the safety inventory, the supply chain manager
has two key objectives
one is to plan the appropriate level of safety inventory
and the second one is to improve the product availability
while reducing the safety inventory
music
let us discuss the supply chain uncertainty
and how it impacts safety inventory
music
influencing the required level of safety inventory,
supply chain uncertainty in supply and demand
warrants high level of safety inventory
music
let us now assume that the average demand
per period is defined as 'd'
music
when number of observations are taken,
we can normalize the demand
which will follow normal distribution
with a mean and standard deviation
to understand the different measures of product availability,
the standard deviation of demand per period
can be assume to be sigma 'd'
music
lead time is the gap between ordering the material and
receiving the same to use
it can be denoted by 'l'
when demand and lead time are constant,
the safety inventry required is zero
music
the requirement of safety inventory arises only when there
to understand the process of lowering safety
is an uncertainty in demand and lead time
music
when demand is uncertain
the safety inventory is determined based on the
standard deviation of demand and the lead time,
which can be mathematically given as
<eqn>safety inventory is equal to sigma d into square root of l </eqn>
music
the extent of safety inventory to be stocked
depends on the service level expected by the organization
inventory and improving product availability
in the last edition,
which reduces the uncertainty in demand
music
improved coordination and sharing of
information among the members of the supply chain often reduces
the uncertainty resulting in reduction of safety inventory
within the supply chain to improve its performance
music
let us now discuss the impact of replenishment policies
on safety inventory
music
when to reorder and how much to reorder
when we follow continuous review policy:
a supply chain manager analyzes the uncertainty in demand
during lead time to adjust the timing of replenishment order
under this policy
music
the manager has no recourse during the lead time
once he places the order
the available safety inventory should take care of
the uncertainty in demand till the new supply arrives
this is the characteristics of
this determines the cycle and safety inventory carried by the firm
continuous review policy and safety inventory in a supply chain
music
periodic review policies:
a supply chain manager reviews the inventory level
at regular intervals of time and an order is placed
to top up the level of inventory from the current level
taking into consideration the demand during lead time
to the top up level
this review policy is simple and easy for the members
in the supply chain to follow
music
the manager has to plan the safety inventory
which will cater to the demand during the order interval time
music
periodic review replenishment policy
requires more safety stock than continuous replenishment
policy for the same level of product
in this edition, we have discussed
the impact of replenishment policy on safety inventory
in the next edition, we will discuss the impact of
aggregation of inventory on safety inventory
let us discuss what a continuous review policy is?
in the supply chain to make the product availability and improve
the performance of the supply chain
thank you
music
inventory levels are continuously monitored during consumption
when the inventory level reaches the reorder point,
the firm decides to buy a lot size of 'q' quantities
this system is followed continuously
to determine the replenishment period
we have discussed the role of safety inventory in supply chain
which may vary based on demand
music
periodic review policy
music
inventory levels are monitored at regular intervals of time
during consumption
music
during the review time, the firm places order
to rise the inventory level to the top up level,
that is the maximum level
in this edition, we will discuss the impact of
when we follow this policy, the time between orders is fixed
whereas the quantity order every time
varies based on the demand or consumption
music
the reorder point is calculated based on the average demand rate,
lead time, variation in demand, variation in lead time,
and service level of the firm
in general, reorder point is equal to lead time demand plus safety stock
music
if 'd' is the average demand rate,
replenishment policies on safety inventory
'l' is the average lead time,
sigma d is the standard deviation of demand,
sigma l is the standard deviation of lead time
and 'z' is the service level expected of the firm,
we can calculate the reorder point on different situations
music
situation 1:
music
when demand and lead time are constant
then the rop is calculated by,
music
mathematically <eqn>rop is equal to d into l </eqn>
music
situation 2:
when demand is varying and lead time is constant
the rop is calculated by, mathematically
<eqn>rop is equal to d into l plus z into sigma d into square root of l,</eqn>
where sigma d is the standard deviation of demand l is the
lead time and z is the service level
situation 3:
demand is constant and lead time is varying
replenishment policy on safety inventory
then the rop is calculated by, mathematically
<eqn>rop is equal to d into l plus z into d into sigma l </eqn>
music
situation 4:
demand and lead time both varying
then the rop is calculated by, mathematically
<eqn>rop is equal to d into l plus z into square root of sigma d
square into l plus d square into sigma l square,</eqn>
music
where sigma d is standard deviation of demand l is the lead time
when we discuss the replenishment of products,
d is the average demand sigma l is the standard deviation of lead time
and z is the service level
music
we calculate rop based on the uncertainty in supply and demand
using the above conditions
music
the fill rate and the cycle service level
increases as the safety stock increases
the required safety inventory increases with the increase in lead time
and the standard deviation of demand
the firm may follow either a continuous replenishment policy
music
with the increased safety inventory the desired product
availability increases to satisfy the demand of the customers
music
the goal of the supply chain manager is to reduce the
safety inventory level in such a way that it does
not affect the product availability to satisfy the customers
to achieve this, the manager has two options,
music
reduction in lead time 'l' or reduce the uncertainty in demand
or a periodic review replenishment policy
music
reduction in lead time is possible if there is an
understanding with the supplier and a coordinated effort in
planning the supply chain demand, which reduces the
safety inventory at the retailer point
music
reduction in demand uncertainty is possible
if there is a good forecasting technique,
a good market intelligence system, and
coordinated effort of the supply chain members,
the replenishment policy decides
to cater to the fluctuating demand or have an
aggregate inventory of different products in each region to cater
to the demand
aggregation decreases the safety inventory
and increases the desired cycle service level and
product availability
when aggregation takes place, it may
increase the response time to customer order and increase the
transportation cost to the customer
aggregation can also happen
in the last edition we have discussed the impact of
without having the physical centralization of inventory into one location
this may be possible by centralization of information
when information is centralized,
the orders are filled from the closest warehouse
where the products are stored
music
if the stock level is less than the demand,
then the required quantity of products are moved
from the next nearest warehouse to satisfy the demand requirements
keeping the transportation cost as low as possible
replenishment policies on safety inventory
this reduces the amount of safety inventory to be maintained
for providing a high level of product availability
substitution:
substitution is referred to a situation where a
demand for one product is met with a different product to
satisfy the customer
this can happen under two different conditions or instances
one, manufacturer driven substitution
and the other one is customer driven substitution
manufacturer driven substitution, where the manufacturer substitutes
in this edition, we will discuss the impact of aggregation of inventory
a higher value product for a lower value product
when the lower value product is out of stock
the manufacturer uses this manufacturer driven substitution
helps the supply chain to increase the overall
profitability of the supply chain members by allowing
aggregation of demand, which reduces the inventory requirement
for the availability of products
music
second, customer driven substitution
is where the customers make the decision
on safety inventory and product availability in the supply chain
to buy a substitute product to satisfy their requirement
recognition of a customer driven substitution and jointly managing
the inventory across the supply chain with
substitution products allows the supply chain to reduce the
requirement of safety inventory while satisfying the product availability
music
another aggregation strategy is usage of common components
music
when we use common components for reducing
the safety inventory across a supply chain it is the process
aggregation of safety inventory:
of designing and manufacturing common components for products
which are manufactured by the company
common components reduce the safety inventory to be stored
for making the product available
music
postponement is another strategy which can be
used in aggregation of inventory postponement is the ability of the
supply chain to delay the product differentiation until
the product is sold in the market
as a result of this most of the inventories in the supply chain
supply chains have varying degree of inventory aggregation
are aggregated to reduce the safety inventory
without affecting the product availability
music
in the three modules discussed, we have discussed the role of
safety inventory in supply chain, the impact of
replenishment policies on supply chain, the impact of aggregation
of inventory on supply chain and making the product available in
the supply chain with the reduced safety inventory
to summarize safety inventory helps the supply chain to
provide the customers high level of product availability under
one is to aggregate all inventories to a centralized place
the conditions of uncertainty in supply and demand
safety inventory is influenced by demand uncertainty, lead time,
variation in demand and lead time
an increase in these factors increases the safety inventory
the replenishment policy of the firm
also influences the safety inventory
the required level of safety inventory can be reduced and
product availability can be improved, if the members in the
supply chain can reduce the demand variability, lead time
variability, and exploit the aggregation of inventories
and serve the customers as when the demand arises
proper co-ordination and information sharing among the
members of the supply chain can lead to reduction in safety
inventory without affecting the product availability
this reduces the safety inventory to be maintained
to satisfy the product availability to meet the customer demand
for a seasonal product,
cycle service level determines the optimal stock level
to be maintained to satisfy the demand
based on the cost of overstocking, and the cost of under stocking
music
let 'c' be the cost per unit of the product,
'p' be the selling price per unit of the product
and 's' be the salvage value per unit of the product,
then, cost of overstocking per unit is given by <eqn>co is equal to c minus s</eqn>
to appreciate the importance of product availability in a supply chain,
cost of under stocking per unit is given by <eqn>cu is equal to p minus c</eqn>
supply_chain_management_7770
we can calculate the cycle service level z,
where <eqn>z is equal to cu divided by cu plus co </eqn>
when quantity discounts cd are available for the product,
then cost of overstocking and cost of under stocking
are calculated as below,
cost of overstocking is equal to p minus cd,
cost of understocking is equal to cd minus s
when the demand for a product in the supply chain increases,
to have a thorough knowledge on the various factors
the supply chain has two options to consider
if the demand increases it results in stock out of the product
the first option is to backlog the out of stock product
and filled latter, when replenishment of inventories takes place
in this case no demand is lost,
minimizing the costs becomes equivalent to maximizing profit
if the supply chain manager increases the level of safety inventory,
the backlogging cost gets reduced
but inventory holding cost increases
hence, the supply chain manager should balance these two costs
influencing product availability in a supply chain,
to find out the optimal cycle service level,
which determines the optimum quantity to be stocked
for increasing the profit of the supply chain
music
the second option is the supply chain manager can make a decision of
losing the demand for the out of stock units
music
in this edition we have discussed the importance of
product availability in a supply chain and the factors affecting
the product availability
to have a knowledge on the various methods
in the next edition, we will discuss the different methods
in determining the product availability in a supply chain
thank you
available to determine the product availability in a supply chain
music
introduction to supply chain:
a supply chain involves in moving materials
from the supplier point to the customer point through the
intermediaries in a cost-effective manner to satisfy the customer
module three, determining optimum level of product availability
in this process we can visualize information flow,
fund flow, and material flow across the supply chain in both directions
the primary objective of supply chain is to
satisfy the customer needs and generate profit

let us now look into what product availability mean?
product availability is defined as the firm's ability to meet
the customer demand from the available inventory
if the firm is not able to meet the demand
from the available inventory,
learning objectives are: to understand the
it results in stock out situation
hence, safety inventory helps the firm
to avoid stock out situations
product availability depends on product fill rate,
order fill rate, and cycle service level
music
product fill rate is that part of demand
which is satisfied from product inventory
fill rate is equivalent to the probability of
product demand met from the available inventory
importance of product availability in a supply chain,
music
order fill rate is that part of orders which are
filled from the available inventory
to have a higher order fill rates
the firm has to stock enough inventories of all products
that the firm produces
music
cycle service level is that part of the replenishment cycle
which meets the customer demand
a replenishment cycle is the time gap between
to understand the factors affecting product availability
two successive order deliveries
cycle service level is the probability of not having a stock out
in a replenishment cycle period
it is denoted by 'z' as discussed earlier the service level
music
importance of product availability:
the supply chain can use a high level of product availability to
improve its responsiveness and attract customers to buy products
which will increase the revenue of the supply chain
high level of product availability requires large amount of inventories
in a supply chain,
which increases the supply chain cost
hence, a supply chain has to balance the level of product availability
and the cost of inventory to find out the optimal level of product
it can stock that maximizes the profit of the supply chain
music
factors affecting the optimal level of product availability
the objective of a supply chain
is to satisfy the expectation of the customer
in meeting the expectation of the customer,
the supply chain is expected to build enough inventory
to understand the methods of determining
to meet the demand of the customer
building inventory helps the supply chain
to improve its responsiveness, but increases the holding cost
when the supply chain maintains a high level of product availability
and if the demand turns out to be low,
the supply chain accumulates inventory and this may result in
a cost to the supply chain known as cost of overstocking
cost of overstocking is defined as the loss incurred by the supply chain
for each unsold item at the end of the selling period
similarly if the supply chain maintains a lower product availability
product availability in a supply chain
to reduce the holding cost and if the demand turns out to be high,
the supply chain has to turn away certain customers
who are willing to buy, which may results in a cost to
the supply chain known as the cost of under stocking
cost of under stocking
is defined as the margin lost by the supply chain
for each lost sales of the product
hence, these two factors that is cost of over stocking
and cost of under stocking influence the optimal product availability
in a supply chain
music
a supply chain in determining the optimal product quantity
analyzes these two costs based on the expected demand
that is forecasted and calculates the expected profit
a plot of the total expected profit and the order quantity
explicitly shows the optimal order quantity
that the supply chain can stock in order to maximize the profits
when these two costs changes, the optimal quantity also changes
music
optimum cycle service level and the costs
cycle service level determines the safety inventory to be stocked
the learning outcomes are:
product availability to increase the profitability of the supply chain
to summarize: product availability ensures
higher level of customer satisfaction
the factors influencing the level of product availability are
cost of overstocking and cost of under stocking
these two cost are to be balanced
to determine the optimal level of product availability
a manager improves the supply chain profitability
by maintaining optimal level of product availability
or optimal level of cycle service level by increasing the
supply chain managers adopt different approaches
salvage value of each unit of the product overstocked,
decreasing the margin loss from stock out situation per unit,
using improved forecast to reduce uncertainty,
using quick response to reduce lead times,
using postponement strategy to delay product differentiation,
and using tailored sourcing to meet the demand requirement
music
to increase the profitability of the supply chain
approach 1: the manager has to increase the salvage value of each unit
he can plan to sell the overstock products
in outlet stores located at different location
rather than discarding them
by this the salvage value increases
when salvage value increases, it increases the profitability of
the supply chain as well as the optimal cycle inventory
music
in the last edition we have discussed the importance of
approach 2:
the manager has to decrease the margin lost from stock out
he can make arrangements with
backup sourcing to get stock and satisfy the demand
or he could arrange for substitute products to satisfy the customer
this decreases the margin lost from stock out
when the margin lost from stock out of each unit is decreased,
it increases profitability of the supply chain
as well as the optimal cycle inventory
music
product availability in a supply chain and the factors affecting
approach 3:
the manager has to reduce the demand uncertainty to match
supply and demand thereby reducing the cost of overstocking
and cost of under stocking
to reduce demand uncertainty
the manager uses the following strategies:
he can use improved forecasting,
quick response, postponement and tailored sourcing
music
improved forecast:
the product availability
the members of the supply chain co-ordinate with each other
and share information about the customer requirements
to improve the forecast accuracy
a shared demand planning information across
the supply chain helps to achieve this
with improved forecast accuracy,
the manager of the supply chain reduces the demand
uncertainty to decrease the cost of overstocking and under stocking
for increasing the profitability of the supply chain
music
in this edition we will discuss the different methods
quick response:
the members of the supply chain
plan to reduce the replenishment lead time
for achieving the quick response to the customer demand
when lead time decreases, the forecast accuracy improves
this helps the supply chain to match the supply
with demand and thereby increase the
profitability of the supply chain
music
the third strategy can be postponement
in determining the product availability in a supply chain
individual product forecast gives greater accuracy of demand
close to the sale of a product the supply chain manager uses
this information to delay the product differentiation
until the sale of the product,
which is known as postponement strategy
this allows supply chain manager to better match the supply with
the demand
if the supply chain postpones the product differentiation,
a significant increase in profits
and reduction in inventory can be achieved
methods of determining product availability:
music
the other strategy is tailored sourcing
the supply chain manager develops two
sources of supply for the products
one focuses on cost
and has the capacity to meet the predictable portion of the demand
the second source will have flexibility and will be
responsive to meet the uncertain portion of the demand
this strategy to have two sources to match the supply and demand
is known as tailored sourcing
the cost of overstocking and the cost of under stocking directly
tailored sourcing increases the profitability of the supply chain
music
when we use tailored sourcing there are two types:
one may be based on volume which is called as
volume based tailored sourcing
and the other one may be based on product
which is called as product based tailored sourcing
volume based tailored sourcing is the process of
producing the predictable demand in an efficient facility
and the uncertain portion of the demand
influenced the optimal level of product quantity,
is produced at a flexible facility
product based tailored sourcing is the process of producing
high volume products with less uncertainty
in an efficient facility and low volume uncertain demand produced
at a flexible facility
music
in the two modules we have discussed
the importance of product availability in supply chain,
the factors affecting the product availability in a supply chain
and the different methods available in determining the
optimal cycle service level and profitability of the supply chain
has a current salvage value of rupees two lakh
and the remaining of six years the existing warehouse was
initially purchased for rupees ten lakh and is being depreciated
on the basis of straight line method
the new warehouse needs an investment of rupee fourteen lakh
and will be subject to the same method of depreciation
the asset has an expected useful life of six years,
salvage value of rupees two lakh at the sixth-years end
the management anticipates that with the expanded operations,
there will be a need of
know intra organization transfers in supply chain planning
an additional net working capital of rupee one lakh
the new warehouse will allow the firm
to expand current operations and hereby
increase annual revenues by rupees four hundred and ninety-six thousand after thirty percent variable cost ratio
fixed costs excluding depreciation is
predicted to remain unchanged
the corporate taxes thirty-five percent and its cost of capital is ten percent
financial evaluation whether to replace existing warehouse
incremental cash outflows
considering the cost of the new machine,
and transfer pricing methods,
the additional working capital required,
and the salvage value of existing warehouse
is found to be rupees thirteen lakh
determination of incremental cash flow after tax
incremental cash flow after tax considering the tax
and depreciation is found to be three lakh ninety-two thousand, four hundred
determination of net present value
net present value is found to be positive
of rupees five lakh seventy-seven thousand, nine hundred and two considering
the cash flow after tax for the six years
understand the applications with illustrations
and salvage value at the end of the sixth year
and working capital recovery at the end of the six th year
the analysis shows positive npv
for the proposal of establishing a new warehouse
concluding not to promote and it is found to be conducive
to establish the new warehouse in due course of the business
to overcome the present constraints of existing warehouse
in the above analysis the major determinants of decisions are
cash outflow and cash inflow
which subsequently affects the decision
on transfer pricing under different decision situations
cash inflows are subjected to incremental benefit and operating cost
cost factors obviously are
influenced by major strategies in a supply chain
systematic evaluation of supply chain decisions
which affects long term distribution system
of the organization would reduce
future uncertainties and overcome loss
due to wrong long term decisions
let us discuss in the next video on
supply chain strategy and cost an intra firm transfers
learning outcomes: at the end of
and transfer pricing methods
this session, learners would be able to gain knowledge on the
need for financial evaluation of supply chain decisions,
comprehend the methods of transfer pricing,
apply transfer pricing methods in financial evaluation of
intra organization transfers under different situations
dear learners!
when there is external supply and demand,
optimum utilization of resources and differential tax rates
in the first video we will focus on supply chain design
and evaluation of cash flow using net present value technique
let me start with the significance of financial evaluation
effectiveness of any managerial function is assessed
ultimately based on its financial outcome
in this sense understanding the dynamics of supply chain design
and its contribution towards financial outcome is very significant
providing high quality services at lowest possible input cost
welcome you all to the lesson on
as a requirement of any functional management in today's scenario
financial implications of supply chain design
supply chain design is the outcome of supply chain decisions
viz , supply chain strategy,
planning and supply chain operations
all these components have a literal impact on
financial outcome either in the manner of leveraging uncertainty,
cost reduction or in optimum utilization of resources
supply chain design determines
significant investments in supply chain such as:
financial evaluation of supply chain decisions
establishment of channels,
acquire or lease required warehouses,
purchase or lease transportation vehicles and so on
the decision on acquiring long term assets
have long term financial implications
on the firm termed as capital budgeting decisions
evaluation of capital budgeting decisions in supply chain
should consider various uncertainties such as:
demand fluctuations, exchange rate fluctuations,
political and legal influences,
i would be presenting the lesson on three videos
economic dynamism at domestic and international level
these factors have a significant impact on
cash inflow of any project
an in-depth evaluation of cash flow analysis is essential
determination of cash flows
in evaluating the cash flow alternatives
widely prevalent method is to determine incremental cash flow
which analyses the differences in cash outflow and inflow due
to the decision considered
incremental after tax cash inflow with relevant cash outflows
learning objectives of this module are:
are to be considered
further tax effects, effects on other projects,
effect of indirect expenses and effect of depreciation
determines the cash flow of the decision
discounted cash flow analysis:
supply chain decisions have long term effect on firm's cash inflow
and therefore it should be evaluated on series of cash inflows
over the life time of the asset
discounted cash inflow analysis is based on the
present value of money concept that is,
understand the nuances of supply chain design and
a rupee today is more valuable than tomorrow
the present value of cash flow is found by discounting factor
if a rupee is invested today
and earn a rate of return k over the next period,
an investment of rupees one will result in one plus k rupees in
the next period
an investor may not find the difference
in receiving rupee one in the next period,
or rupee one by one plus k in the current period
therefore rupee one is discounted in the next period
financial evaluation of supply chain decision
as discounted factor is equal to one by one plus k
considering the rate of return, discount rate,
hurdle rate or opportunity cost, initial cash outflow,
the present value of future cash flows
or cash inflows that is c one to ct over the subsequent periods
and a rate of return k, salvage value and working capital recovery
at the end of the period
the npv on the cash flow stream is given by
<eqn>npv is equal to t equal to one summation n
c one by one plus k to the power of n plus salvage value of nth period
with capital budgeting technique,
and working capital recovery at the end of the period
divided by one plus k to the power of n minus cash outflow
at the initial period </eqn>
illustration to evaluate a supply chain decision of
replacing a warehouse
consider hypothetical company, which is in the process of establishing
a new warehouse since the existing warehouse
has its own constraints and the firm wants
to expand its supply chain operations
the existing warehouse channel
discern supply chain strategy and its impact on cost,
dear learners! welcome you all to the module on pricing and
system results in creation of fixed cost for example, a
retail store with its established resources should increase
various brands and product varieties to use its store space
and customer network efficiently
performance tracking is the base for managerial control the firm
should know the critical success factors in its supply chain and
should leverage it efficiently through prompt response to
customers queries for example, for high end industrial
machineries and even for any consumer electronic products
after sales service is the critical success factor
costing to price individual customers in this video, let us
cost reduction is thus an inevitable area in pricing and
revenue management in supply chain management by identifying
the operational intricacies and critical success factors to
match customers requirements would aid in establishing
competent pricing and proficient revenue management system with
this note on scope for cost reduction in supply chain, let
me move on to the discussion on value added and non value
added activities in supply chain pricing and revenue management
in the next video
analyze the aspects of cost savings for pricing
and revenue management in supply chain let me move on to the
introduction
revenue management is a crucial area where every firm should be
more vigilant to keep the company in a safest position it
is a complex term to think practically to overcome the
bottle necks for efficient execution of operations any
revenue management model ultimately aims to maximise
profit fundamentally, profit is determined by revenue & cost
revenue management in supply chain i would be presenting this
and revenue is based on selling price per unit and volume so
eventually a firm can fetch more profit logically under two
situations: utilizing the price advantage when the demand
conditions are favorable, saving more by controlling cost which
means cost competitiveness in the long run it is more logical
to concentrate on costing and pricing in revenue management
cost savings is the crux of pricing and revenue management
in any industry there is wider scope for cost reduction due
to the presence of long stream of components in logistics value
chain depth refers to the operational intricacies in the
module in three videos
supply chain components every industry is unique and the ways
to cut cost will differ operational understanding of the
supply chain will help in identifying the areas of cost
reduction let us see few examples of certain industries
textile: textile industry is highly affected by cotton price
price fluctuations in cotton price provides scope for cost
savings through proper inventory management and procurement at
right time aviation industry: aviation industry generates
revenue with passenger traffic and goods transportation and
affected by seasonality distribution of service with
learning objectives of this module are: understand the scope
mutual promotional pricing serves better resource
utilization and reduced procurement cost through fuel
hedging and contractual purchase of material needs of support
services which aid and saves costs retail stores:
super markets and retail stores partake cost reduction in areas
of vendor and inventory management and better customer
service through home delivery time management in procurement,
ordering time efficiency, and delivery time is aspects which
reduces cost and brings value addition to customers the
overriding fact in all the industries is the understanding
for cost reduction in supply chain revenue management,
of the dynamism and operational intricacies in cost reduction
let us see how systematic approach would support cost
reduction in supply chain
identification of product and service requirement of the
customers is the predominant factor in service enhancement
understand what adds value to the customer and avoid the non
value added product or services in the supply chain for
example
mixer shall exempted to reduce cost and price of the product
the delivery system shall provide the customer in choosing
identify the areas of non value added cost, application of abc
required size and type of jar in the product bundle
strategies are supportive diplomacies for vision and
objectives of the organisation and determines the tactics in
outlining the strategies for tactical planning an
understanding of the requirement of the customer is crucial
there are certain areas to clung on it: map the operations in
each component of supply chain, identify the causes and resource
deficiencies for the problem, analyse the gap in customer
requirements, solve the problems relating the gap and problems
for example: timely delivery to remote places may be the
costing in pricing and revenue management learning outcomes at
identified problem and the firm should approach strategically to
collaborate for distribution with other corporates ensuring
that it will not affect its competitive edge
operational conceptualization will give a clear picture on
interdependencies and dependencies of tasks this
would help in identifying the bottlenecks and to predetermine
solutions for unavoidable problems that may arise in
execution for example: delay in departure and arrival is
unavoidable in airline industry due to natural calamities and
unforeseen problems collaborative strategies with
the end of this session, learners would be able to recognize the
other airlines would reduce the cost of such crisis management
the added cost for such problems will give more benefit
by way of customer satisfaction and retaining the reputation
network management is essential especially to match supply and
customer requirements especially in execution of just
in time manufacturing for reduction of unnecessary
inventory cost, network management is very significant
toyota's just in time manufacturing system to deliver
the product by producing when demand arises is the crux of its
success
ways to reduce cost for competitive pricing comprehend
outsourcing and efficient vendor management is the
success platform in supply chain management in the scenario of
product diversification and customisation vendor
management demands more focus to satisfy the customers varied
needs at less cost for example, walmart has well
established vendor management system which serves mutually by
direct procurement from suppliers and both the vendors
and customers benefit ultimately
utilization of resource to avoid idle capacity is another
aspect of cost reduction establishment of a supply chain
the value added and non value added activities apply abc
dear learners from the previous video you would have understood
in reengineering in the supply chain activities and processes
and this will result in cost reduction and competitive
pricing a simple exercise for you to understand non-value
added activities in cost reduction would help for better
understanding imagine you're going for shopping for your
birthday party, identifying six activities and sketch the
process of the activities, identify two non value added
activity thank you and see you in the next session on abc
costing and pricing in revenue management
customers, irrespective of any industry and activity can be
classified as either value added activity or non-value added
activity from the perspective of customers value-added and non-
value added activities the activities or steps which adds
value to the functionality of the product or service or
business or customers is value added activities and the activities
or steps which does not add value to the product or service
functionality, business or customers and simply adds
cost and delays time is non- value added activity
customer orientation: the management mantra of either giant
how cost saving aid pricing and revenue management in this
corporate or small business firm is customer is the king
so, anything that does not add value is considered to be a
waste resource management: the purpose of identification of
value added and non-value added activities is to eliminate wastage
resource management focuses on utilization for best alternative
purposes so, any resource spent for non value added activity is
mere waste since the resources would be limited further, this
will increase the cost and price market structure and
competitive pricing in the scenario of monopoly
competition, a firm may not focus on elimination of non-
video on value added and non- value added activities in
value added activity since the firm is a price maker and not
price taker in the market most of the firms in the present
economic system are not in a monopoly setup other than
government owned sectors firms are facing intensive price
competition and therefore, it is very essential to streamline and
eliminate non value added activities to have control on
cost for competitive pricing competitive pricing is the most
appropriate method to win strategically profit maximisation:
a firm's ultimate short term goal is to maximise profit when
a firm wants to maximize profit it should use the resources for
pricing and revenue management, we will discuss the significance
profitable purposes and eliminate cost the product
which provides maximum contribution per unit should be
given priority in production if resources are utilized for
product with less contribution margin there will be an
opportunity loss to the firm
let us see the possibilities of competitive pricing through
elimination of non value added activities lean process and
thinking can help the management to identify the ways to eliminate
the non-value added activities lean the supply chain in an
organization for the changes that is required to move on with
of identification of value added and non-value added activities,
the phase of dynamism the possible areas of elimination
or transportation in most of the industries the major
proportion of non-value adding cost is transportation cost
this is an area where every firm has the scope for cost reduction
it is an essential activity which does not add value to the
customers to overcome the effect of such costs firms can
establish collaborative partners for distribution to share the
transportation resources among them inventory management:
inventories such as raw material, work in process, and
finished products require unnecessary activities when
its causes and consequences on pricing and revenue management
stocked beyond limit and it adds cost in terms of maintenance and
capital investment proper vendor management, automisation,
and just in time manufacturing will eliminate the non-value
added activities associated with inventory management warehouse
location: warehouse at right location reduces unnecessary
movement of goods to different shopping outlets this needs
statistical analysis to identify location points
focusing on active shopping centers this would avoid
frequent transportation, over stocking, under stocking,
unnecessary investment in warehousing etc waiting time:
let me start with an introduction to what is value in
waiting time in production and in meeting the delivery schdule
due to bottlenecks in the system adds unnecessary
extra cost in overcoming the expedited time by way of spending
more for quick packaging, extra cost for quick transportation
arrangements etc over production: over production of the products
without considering the demand in the product line leads to
loss of profit the failed product would eat away the
profit of successful product due to overstocking cost over-
processing or over servicing: over processing or over servicing for
unnecessary accuracy is a non value added activity which would
the present context?
lead to increase in cost and price over servicing will
lead to more waiting time in the queue for the customers and will
lead to dropping of customers defects: defective items add non
value added activities in supply chain such as rectification,
buy back management, loss of reputation etc this will lead
to reduction in revenue the negative implications of non-
elimination of non-value added activities can be summarized as:
products which are difficult to produce will have high profit
margin, a product that has to be dropped may show high profit in
the product bundle, competitor product will show a
from the perspective of management notes as, anything
significantly lesser price, company will lose bids for
simple products which has high profit and will fetch bids for
complicated and low profit products due to irrelevant
pricing it will be difficult to retain the customers and enhance
market share since resources are wasted for non-value added
activities
i would like to conclude this lesson saying that
identification of value-added activities and non-value added
activities is a significant task in establishing an efficient
supply chain elimination of non- value added activities would help
that adds value to the product, service, and ultimately to the
dear learners from the previous video and analysis on value-
abc cost
analysis more accurate and logical in determining the
supply chain cost for individual customers
assigning cost on the basis of machine hours activity based
costing first allots costs to the activities that are the actual
reason of the overhead
tracing the direct cost to the final product or service is
simple and both the methods directly traces the direct cost
to the final product as costs are well identifiable with the
product for example, raw material cost per unit is
directly traced to the final product since it is well
identifiable indirect cost, the allocation of indirect cost is
cumbersome and there lies methodical difference in
added and non-value added activity was dealt in depth in this
traditional costing and abc costing in conventional
costing, overhead cost allocation is volume based or
factory or department wise overhead cost such as: indirect
material, indirect labour are allocated using a base such as
labour hours and machine hours in activity based costing,
indirect costs are allocated using activity cost drivers for
example, transport equipment costs are allocated from the
material handling cost pool using number of parts handled,
inspectors salary is allocated from the inspection activity
cost pool using number of units inspected
video we will discuss the significance of activity based
the following steps are followed in determination of cost using
abc model identify the cost object: cost objects are
separate unit for which cost are assigned such as product,
service or department etc identify the activities: the
activities associated with the production of a product should
be mapped assign cost to activity-based cost pools: cost
pool refers to consolidation of individual costs associated with
an activity identify a relevant cost driver for the cost pool:
cost driver is identified with the activity that causes the
cost determine the cost driver rate: after identifying the cost
costing, illustration on evaluation of pricing and
driver cost driver rate is calculated for per unit cost
object allocate the costs to the cost object: allocate the cost
to the cost object from the cost pool let us see the following
example of a retail store to analyze the distribution cost in
designing the customize invoice profit using abc costing
the following illustration depicts how abc costing is used
to identify the contribution or operating income
per unit of different customers xyz limited has to evaluate the
present pricing system for customer based profit
assessment using abc costing it buys bottled water at rupees
revenue based on activity based cost analysis
one hundred per case and sells to retail customers at a customized
price upon the list price of rupees one hundred and eighteen per case the data
pertaining to five
customers are given below
in the present illustration, we can see the cases sold at
different prices to the customers a, b, c, d and e, and
the number of purchase orders for each customer is given in
detail and number of customer visits for each customer and
number of deliveries to each customer and the number of
kilometers travelled per month for each customer and number of
cost of individual activities are calculated and assigned to
expedited deliveries to each customer is given based on the
activities: activity cost driver is identified by the retail
store the activities undertaken are: order taking, customer visits,
deliveries, product handling and expedited deliveries the cost
driver rate are calculated appropriately and it is
determined to be rupees seven hundred and fifty per purchase order, rupees six hundred per
customer visit, rupees five seventy-five per delivery kilometer travelled, rupees
three seventy-five per bottle sold, and rupees two twenty-five per expedited delivery the
customer level operating income of each of the five retail
customers are calculated individually the present
each product or service on the basis of activities required to
analysis sales revenue per month for each customer is calculated
by
multiplying the selling price per unit with the respect to volume
of units that is sold to each customer with this, the
costs are deducted to calculate the total income for each
customer the cost includes the cost of each case that is bought
by the retail store and other operating costs are order taking
cost, cost of customer visits, delivery cost, product handling
cost, expedited delivery costs the costs are consolidated to
find the total income for each customer and the income per
produce a product or to service a customer (abc) costing allots
customer is calculated by dividing the number of cases
sold to each customer operating income per case is calculated to
be fifteen twenty-eight rupees for customer a, fifteen seventy-eight rupees for customer b,
rupees eight seven hundred and ninety-seven for customer c, fourteen one hundred and seven rupees for customer d,
and rupees three ninety-nine for customer e in the above analysis customers
are evaluated based on the activity cost drivers namely
order taking cost, customer visit cost, delivery cost,
product handling cost, expedited delivery cost analysis shows
that customer b and a are more profitable since they provide
highest contribution per case of rupees fifteen twenty-eight and fifteen seventy-eight
manufacturing overhead cost to cost of objects in a more
followed by customers d,c, and e generate contribution per
unit as rupees fourteen one hundred and one rupees eight seventy-nine and rupees three ninety-nine
respectively in prioritizing the distribution of water
bottles, xyz company shall execute the orders as per their
contribution per unit if xyz has to how uniform profit margin
then it should consider the contribution per unit
and price accordingly
the abc cost analysis more appropriate in customer
selection and prioritizing the order for pricing and revenue
management
reasonable manner than the traditional approach of simply
dear learners in the previous video, you had an insight on
benefit in selling perishable and seasonal products
source it provides working capital leverage if the cash
cycles are shortened through proper sales management there
are various means to manage pricing for perishable goods
and let me discuss some of them techniques of pricing and
revenue management for perishable goods rapidity of
supply chain for perishable goods increases revenue and
profit a perishable product is one which has shortest self- life
firm's ability to shorten the time required to bring the
products at sale point is the root for success this would
maintain the goods fresh by quick loading and unloading,
pricing for multiple customer segments in this video, we will
efficient transportation system, lesser waiting time in the dock,
cold management system etc the bottlenecks in the
touch points of supply chain should be reduced so that the
self-life of the product shall be increased the time required
to convert goods to cash decreases by quickening the
velocity of supply chain the firm's investment from the time
of ordering, bringing to the sale point and making it a real sale
has interest cost and further the self-time of the product
decreases the wastage and this increases the profit margin
further, this would enhance the revenue through maximizing the
discuss on: techniques of pricing and revenue management for
pre frequency of goods converted into cash that is turnover
prioritise based on self-life and price the self-life of
goods has vital role in pricing the goods for example,
if a product has a self-life of twenty days, the first ten days are
utilized in transportation and the product is ready for sale,
from eleven th day in the retail shop, it should price
differently for different stages of its self-life it should price
high keeping the probability of wastage of the product due to
its perishability and profit margin, say till the fifteen th day of the
self- life does retail shops should price less from the eighteen th
perishable goods, pricing and revenue management for seasonal
day to twenty th day to push the products? the frequency of time
based pricing may depend on the forecasted demand within the
self- life multi point regional procurement multi point
regional procurement would reduce the perishability of the
products since it procures for its retail chain from the nearby
locality especially regionally available and abundant products
the procurement strategy should be in a such a way that only the
most demanded and unavailable products are procured from far
which would reduce transportation cost,
refrigeration cost, and wastage costs and enhance value addition
products let me move on to the significance of perishable
to the customers through quality maintenance dynamic pricing
dynamic pricing refers to variable pricing where the firm
considers various factors in perishable goods the firm
categorizes a good based on various factors and price
instead of a single price for example, a flower vendor may
price differently consedring the auspicious days since the
flowers are highly demanded on those days further utility
requirements and timing also influence price discrimination
and the flowers are priced differently during evening hours
and morning hours with a note on pricing for perishable goods
commodities in retailing perishable commodities play a
let me move on to pricing for seasonal products what is a
seasonal product? a seasonal product follows a set pattern of
expenditure in the customers calendar which may be
influenced by: climatic requirement, religious
requirements such as festivals, professional requirement, tour
seasons etc population with diversified culture are
influenced much with festivals and retailers usually follow
varied promotion strategies to boost their sales during these
seasons it is a cumbersome and interesting area to understand
and execute pricing policy for seasonal products let me
vital role in retail market since it is a major revenue and
discuss few points to be considered in pricing seasonal
products inventory optimization inventory
optimization in seasonal products refers to trade-off
between overstocking cost and understocking cost
overstocking may lead to dumping of investment and understocking
may lead to loss of demand overstocking results in cost
hike and reduction of profit and understocking will lead to loss
of customers and revenue both has an impact on
pricing in the long run as cost influences price and under
stocking impacts volume of sales and pricing pricing to promote
profit generating area appropriate inventory management
pricing less to promote for the products during seasons is a
strategy that has been used to compete with the competitors
this strategy is used to attract customers since the demand is in
peak during the seasons and revenue maximization through
demand creation via low pricing is tranquil quantity discounts
pricing the products to sale out the old stocks during seasonal
demand for garments and vehicles is a technique to increase
revenue and capitalize inventory buy one get one free is a common
discount strategy that is followed by garment shops and in
other fancy accessory shops wholesale price index wholesale
with proper supply chain and sales support would make the
price index is also a measure to price the seasonal products as
wholesale price index gives the variations in the goods price
till they reach the customers it is a pricing method which is
based on supply of goods producer's price index is also
another index measured in usa such indices help to systemize
the pricing methodology of seasonal products based on
supply and demand conclusion: pricing for perishable and
seasonal products is more dynamic since there is high
level of unpredictability in supply and demand yet firms
and retail shops are very aimful in generating lottery
perishable retail sector in retailing a cash generating
dear learners! welcome you all to the module on performance
mechanisms, supply chain performance and control-
throughput dollar days, supply chain performance and control-
inventory dollar days the learning objectives is to explain
the need for measuring supply chain performance and the
concepts of throughput dollar days and inventory dollar days
as the supply chain performance and control measure by the end
of this session, the learner will be able to appreciate
goldratt's approach to supply chain performance and control, apply
throughput and inventory dollar days in setting supply chain
performance measures welcome you all to the first lesson on
measurement and controls in supply chain measuring supply
supply chain performance measurement and control supply
chain management aims to ensure effective flow of materials,
information, and funds across various supply chain partners
so, what should the supply chain performance measure and control
mechanism? a well-established supply chain performance and
control should provide insights about: supplier competences,
customer satisfaction, outcomes of supply chain network and
partnership the supply chain models namely: supply chain
operations reference model, design-chain operations
reference model, and the customer chain operations
chain performance has many approaches but most are
reference model define the processes for effective supply
chain performance and metrics for performance measurement the
second most important performance measure is the cost
of supply chains the application of activity based
costing across the supply chain by all the participants of the
supply chain has led to performance and control of
supply chains in contemporary supply chain management process,
the performance of supply chain is measured across two key
performance indicators timely delivery of products and
services, cost savings due to timely delivery of products and
extremely complex and difficult to implement added to this is
services control mechanisms the delivery of products will have
an impact on the cost associated with excess inventory and
extensive lead time so the three major supply chain control
mechanisms that have been adapted by all the supply chain
partners are: managing inventory velocity, time compression, and
perfect order now, i will present some highlighting points
across the supply chain control mechanisms and its impact on
supply chain performance managing inventory velocity:
inventory is a challenge in supply chain because: excessive
inventory leads to unproductive investment and obsolescence
the problem of sharing data on performance across the supply
inventory shortages lead to delays across the supply chain
and customer dissatisfaction inventory velocity is a
control mechanism which will reduce bullwhip effect and
ensure timely supply inventory compression is emphasised at
every point of the supply chain the total cost of excess or
shortage of inventory should be considered across the entire
supply chain total inventory dollar days is a metric that can
be deployed for inventory management time compression
inventory and logistics issues in supply chains result in
longer lead-time and stockout situations this has emphasized
chain without compromising competitive secrets goldratt
the requirement for time compression time compression
can be effectively executed by monitoring the cycle time
metrics namely: order placement to order fulfillment, manufacture
to order completion, on-time customer delivery, order to cash
conversion, outstanding sales days throughput dollar days is
a metric that can result in time compression and reduce
blockages across the supply chain perfect orders a firm
receiving the good from its suppliers should be as per the
specification in the orders perfect order fulfillment by
suppliers is a beginning of effective supply chain
has come up with much simpler approach to document and assess
performance as it ensures the: quality of end products and
services, cost savings due to avoidance of delays, longer lead
time and returns similarly, perfect order fulfillment to
meet customer expectation is the ultimate measure of the supply
chain performance this would lead to enhanced customer
satisfaction and reduced reverse logistics issues with the basic
understanding of performance measurement and control, a small
exercise for you identify five performance issues in a supply
chain and suggest a control mechanism for the same thank
you and welcome you all for the next two lessons in supply chain
supply chain performance based on speed of flow of materials
performance measurement and control by professor n vivek
the module covers goldratt's approach as three lessons namely:
supply chain performance measurement and control
tdd is also useful in identifying the bottleneck in the entire supply chain
in our case, if you would note player "b" has a total tdd of
one thousand, one hundred and seventy-four which is another use for this particular calculation is
finding the bottleneck in the entire supply chain
if you will notice in this particular example, player 'c' has a total tdd
of two thousand, three hundred and forty lakhs this means player "c" is the bottleneck, he is
getting delayed the maximum if the entire supply chain has
to do better, everyone should focus on player "c'
can you see how simple this particular calculation was?
but this is only half the story what about deliveries that come early
how do you think we can measure the performance of such
we shall see that in the next video
a vast group of entities, which are all different organizations,
but at the end, they're all working as a network for one final goal
and why do you think we should be measuring their
performance at all? what's wrong and the current setup for each
one measures his own performance let's consider
two different supply chains in the milk industry
we consider two fictitious companies called patle ltd and kamul
which supply chain do you think would be a better choice for supplying milk?
how do you think the supply chains can be measured?
hi, this is professor vivek i am
what information do you think each person should provide
so that the entire supply chain performance can be tracked?
how do you think the information should be collected and processed?
what do you think will be the complexity of the computations?
who should be in charge of maintaining the score
of the supply chain? will it require expensive computing to monitor?
will it be practical to implement it at all?
will it upset the competitive advantage of the different players in the supply chain?
such questions have to be addressed with
measuring the supply chain performance supply chain is all
a doctorate in supply chain management i've been teaching for the last
about measuring flows three major flows characterize the
performance in a supply chain these three flows are material,
information, and money in some industries flow of people can
also be of interest, especially if it's a service industry like
disneyland or hospital any metric that aims to measure the
performance of supply chain has to focus on these flows
there are many methods of tracking supply chain performance
we are going to consider one search method, which stands out for its
ease of application and availability of data
this was given by an israeli genius called eliyahu goldratt
twenty-two years and i teach in the decision sciences department at
he suggested two measures the tdd and the idd
goldratt proposed these two measures as a means to measure
any supply chains performance, we will be considering a slight variant of
the original proposition by goldratt, this is for convenience,
the variation works as well as the original proposition
this video shall consider the first of the
propositions namely tdd goldratt used tdd to denote
throughput dollar days in other words, if a supplier has delayed
his delivery of a certain product, then we lose the
opportunity to sell that product and earn a contribution from it
psg institute of management in module one, we are going to be
the price of sale minus the cost of the product is what we
would have earned if the product had come on time as a result of
this delay, we have lost that earning this is denoted by tdd
in other countries like india, we can use the term total
value base, because the rupee is the currency here
this is a measure of the lateness with which a player supplies any
material to his customer let us assume,
i have to receive a consignment at ten o'clock today,
assuming the value of this consignment is fifty lakhs
and it is delayed by three days, the original measure would be only
discussing how you can measure the performance of an entire supply chain
the number of days the consignment has been delayed
for goldratt went on to say and quite rightfully so, that it's
not just the number of days that's delayed, it's also the total value
hence, the tdd is computed as the product of the
number of days delayed with the value of the delayed items
in our case let us assume the consignment is delayed by three
days with a value of fifty lakhs, the total tdd here would be
three days multiplied by the fifty lakhs which is one hundred and fifty lakhs
the same thing will hold good if there is a delay
after ten days, every single node having a delay should compute
this will enable us to monitor and control the
each and every delay using this same yardstick and noted down
the values are accumulated towards the end and they are
taken stock of at repeated time intervals originally goldratt
proposed : a value known as throughput, throughput is
computed as the value of a stock minus the totally variable cost
here, we are going to neglect the variable costs
and it would work just as well, by talking of the sales value, not
the cost value remember, here the value doesn't represent the
cost value its sales value here, we are going to have a
look at the flow of value through the supply chain
working of the whole supply chain as a single unit
let's consider a small example this example talks about three
players in a supply chain a supplies to b and b supplies to c
if you see day one, "a" is delayed by one day, his supply
to "b" is delayed by one day, the delay in the value is twenty lakhs
this means the total delay value happens to be twenty lakhs that's the tdd
consider player "b" if you take week number four
he is delayed by five days
while the value delay value is ninety-eight lakhs,
here the total delay value will be ninety-eight
multiplied by five that's four hundred and ninety if you will note the
supply chain: it's a collection of entities which are working together
cumulative delay for player a across the eight days is seven hundred and seventy-eight lakhs,
the same thing for "c" is two thousand, three hundred and forty lakhs note, we are not
interested in the performance of one single player a or b or c
we are interested in the collective performance of all the three
here, we collectively measure the total tdd for all the three
players put together over the eight days and this happens to
be three thousand, five hundred and fourteen lakhs supposing you're considering three
different supply chains, this is a lovely measure to tell you
which supply chain is doing better? ideally, the total tdd
should be zero but in practice it's never the case
to satisfy the needs and wants of the end customer
chain and we also look at the entire supply chain's performance,
meaning a, b and c put together for example, on day one, "a" has
a performance score of one hundred and sixty-four lakhs on day three,
the performance score is four hundred and sixty lakhs what do the tdd and idd mean?
ideally, both the tdd and the idd should be zero, which
would indicate a perfect delivery by every single player
in the supply chain to their subsequent customers
we have considered a very simple supply chain the chain could be
complicated and a huge network, irrespective of that it works
all the same this is probably the simplest and the most direct
what do you think will happen?
measure of flow among so many methods available in the market
to institute this measure of tdd and idd, it is essential that
all the supply chain members agree to make their information public
there is a certain level of transparency, which is
required, which requires a change in thinking in the managements of
the various players in the supply chain all they need to
put up, what is the value of the delay they are
enforcing ? and what is the value of the early deliveries they
have been making? if each player in the supply chain maintains
this record and makes it publicly available to all the
50+50 packets, one hundred packets will sit in our premises for two days
other players, then it's extremely simple for the entire
supply chain to find out who is the bottleneck who needs some help
whom should you not overload because bottlenecks
overloaded means the entire supply chain it's jammed
and this is a lovely method of even comparing two supply chains,
especially if a person is a member of two or more supply chains
music
remember for these two days, they're not going to be sold
they're just sitting there they have absolutely no value for us
it occupies space, it occupies our attention,
consumes current, in all probability, we will have to be
careful that it doesn't get damaged this is the impact
of delivering something early it leads to a buildup of
inventory of stock it also takes up a lot of space
consider what will happen if you have one hundred products
hi, this is vivek back here again!
instead of just the two? imagine if each of the one hundred products is two days
early, and each has a demand of fifty per day
what do you think will happen?
five thousand products per day, meaning
you have a stock of ten thousand products imagine the kind of
space it's going to take up and imagine for today's sale,
i am using products which have arrived day before yesterday
what do you think we will do with the stocks that arrive
today, with the stocks that arrived yesterday?
if we do not have sufficient space, it will cause such a confusion
we are going to study the second part of the supply chain
that products might end up getting mixed
and now imagine if instead of two days,
the products are delivered ten days in advance
can you see the scale of inventory buildup?
can you see the impact on physical space?
what do you think will happen to your investment in working capital?
because, and the usual circumstances, all the stocks
are usually hypothecated to the bank meaning, we pay an interest
on the stocks that we hold the larger the number of stocks, the
larger is the interest to end up paying the banks why would you
performance measurement it's called the "idd" assume we are
want to pay interest on stocks which are not going to be sold
for now, for just holding it in our place for want of delivery timing?
imagine, what would happen if the demand changes from fifty to five thousand each?
this is a humongous problem
can you see the kind of problems early delivery has caused?
consider car rally, let's say a 'himalayan car rally'
how do you think the participants are rated?
let us assume a participant has to reach destination a at five p m
if he arrives at 5:10 p m that's ten minutes late
he is penalized for ten points
dealing in two kinds of milk products, a tetra pack of plain
but if he arrives two minutes early, let us say
4:58 he is penalized by 2*10, twenty points because, they
penalize early reaching ten times more seriously than coming late
can you see why early delivery is such a serious offense?
every supply chain works this way
early delivery upsets the flow, it clogs up the supply chain, it causes payment
delays and money flow problems also
taiichi ohno one said the worst among the seven wastes was overproduction
this hasn't been understood properly by anyone taiichi
ohno did not talk about the numbers taiichi ohno was always talking of flow
milk and another half flavored milk for convenience, let us
what he meant was, "if some player is working faster
than the others meaning, he finishes something quickly and
deliver something early, it leads to a lot of problems"
taiichi ohno is on record saying all the other wastes are caused by this one
single waste called overproduction what he meant
was, if one of the players is so quick that he consistently
delivers early to the other players, he is going to cause a
lot of waste across the network consider a movie, ten of you
want to go for the movie, the movie happens to be at three
o'clock and you reach at two o'clock, what happens? all of you
assume we are dealing in one flavour say vanilla
have to sit and wait for one hour pretty much a waste
on the other hand, consider a bakery they're expecting a lot
of buns for customers at four o'clock and let's say it
arrives one day early what happens? it simply sits at stock
don't you think this is a waste? goldratt decided to measure
this and he called it idd any early delivery would mean
inventory accumulates just as late delivery makes the facility
wait, early delivery is equally serious just like an tdd the
idd has a similar computation tdd measured the number of days
delayed in idd, we measure the number of days, it's arrived early
assume every day we have a constant demand of fifty packets for each product
this translates into inventory value in regular
accounting, we would just note down the cost value of the
inventory, but here, we are not looking at the cost, we are
looking at the total sales value, not at the cost
goldratt computed the throughput, which removed the total variable cost
from the sales value however, we will stick to the value
because it conveys a similar message have a look at our example
this is similar the same supplying chain "a" supplying to
"b" and "b" supplying to "c" on the first day a has an early
arrival of, well, five days and the total value is twenty-five lakhs
assume the supplier supplies both two days in
how much do you think would be the total value of the inventory?
well, hundred and twenty five lakhs consider b on the second day
b arrives two days early and has a total value of fifteen lakhs
this translates to total inventory value of thirty lakhs
here, you see it's not just the number of days the inventory sitting,
it incorporates the value as well original accounting would take
only the number of days here, we take the value that's why
it's called inventory dollar days for non-dollar currencies,
we would call it "inventory value days" just like antdd the idd
values are also accumulated for each single player on the supply
advance, meaning for today's demand he has supplied day before yesterday
one of the players all three can cause serious problems in the supply chain
they have very serious implications on the
material flow and the money flow as well while it's extremely
difficult to standardize the information flow across the
supply chain because each organization has his own kind of
information policy and his own kind of software
we still can come and have a common platform where the flow of information
among partners is standardized, and the frequency and the
protocols are seriously discussed together each person
should not assume what other person thinks is the right information
what are the various risks associated in supply chain flows?
if you will note point number one, namely standardizing
the information has a huge impact on creating a proper
information disruption policy information disruption policy
has no standard mechanism, but then all players can sit
together and always evolve a disruption policy
this particular module has been created so that all of you can
identify disruptions and also identify strategies to deal with
the disruptions in supply chain flows
the next kind of disruption is money flow disruption
money is probably the most important flow in business, although material flow
we studied in module one that supply chain has three kinds of
is highly evident what happens if somebody pays
somebody late? or what happens if somebody defaults on a
payment? or what happens if a mistaken amount is credited to wrong player?
all these cause a lot of irritation, frustration,
much more than either the material flow or the information flow
because people are more serious about money
money flow disruptions happen because different players play
according to different rules they have differing credit
periods, they have differing methods of payment, they have
differing sources of finance, their financial health may be
flows major ones that is material flow, information flow,
different, and also their business compulsions may be different
the most serious problem, however, could be the
business economic cycles during recessions, money flow has a
huge squeeze, which means all the players are hard pressed to pay
this is not as serious as when a certain set of players
in the entire supply chain are squeezed the rest of the supply
chain suffers due to small problems within a few players
how do you think we should deal with money flow disruptions?
there are three important points although there are no general rules
point number one, it's extremely important that every
and money flow material flow is the most gross among the
single player maintain a standard payment schedule
and a standard credit schedule more than the credit period, it's the
variation and the credit period or the payment schedules that
upsets the rest of the players in the supply chain
a small variation on one player can cause huge problems with all the other players
the next point is to have adequate cash stocks or cash reserves
when each player has forecast his money
requirements correctly, it's extremely simple to manage the
entire cash flow the whole problem starts when somebody has
underestimated his cash requirement or is suddenly
flows, the other two flows are a little abstract and so, we
experiencing a cash squeeze where he has to default or
suddenly has to take a loan at an exorbitant rate of interest
all the things cause a ripple across the entire supply chain,
not just a player experiencing it and the third point, which
is equally important is the government policy on credit and payment,
though it looks like a silly point, this influences entire
supply chains and small governmental policy changes,
like credit period or requirement of online tracking
or a sudden change in the technology which the government
mandates as required, for example, the gst can have huge
shall consider the abstract flows first before moving on to the material flow
implications across different supply chains

supply chain risks has many- many connotations but in this module,
we are going to confine ourselves to the disruptions to the flow
consider a dairy supply chain
dear learners! welcome to the module on supply chain risk
we will go backwards, we start with a customer,
you or me, we go to the department store and buy some milk
we are supplied by a retailer who has collected the milk
let's assume this retailer directly gets it from
the dairy farmer, what he in turn supplies it
this dairy farmer in turn has to buy cattle feed and a number of other
inputs for his cows and this supply chain, what happens if
the department store which gives you a milk is on strike a day
you don't get your milk or what happens for the feed supplier is
not able to get the feed to the dairy farmer the cows going to starve
this module covers two sessions session one talks about
what happens if the retailer goes and tells the cow owner,
please give me one hundred litres of milk and he doesn't get the information
what happens if the dairy farmer forgets to pay the
feed supplier all these are called disruptions
they constitute the three kinds of disruptions we had mentioned,
namely material flow disruption, money flow disruption,
and information flow disruption
imagine in this particular case,
you want the information about the milk being delivered or not
being delivered, or changing the quantity of delivery to reach
information and money flow risk session two talks about material flow risk
the customer well in advance what do you think you can do
to make such information reach? do you think you can have it done?
or you want the distributor to tell the milk man the milk is
consistently getting spoiled or the milk last for only two hours
instead of five hours like previously or if his packaging
is not good enough and he is not able to maintain the same
quality when he gives it to the customer or the customer is
pointing fingers at the quality of the milk that is coming on
how do you think the distributor should engage the milkman
or the distributor wants to get to know how the customer actually
learning objectives: one, get a grasp of information
buys the milk in other words, what is his demand pattern?
when does he buy extra milk or when does he say no milk for today
is it possible for the customer to decide in advance that he is
going to buy extra milk or no milk and if so, can the distributor
get access to this kind of information
do you think the customer will think it is private and he is not going to
share it with others or can the customer be convinced that if he shares it
he is likely to get a better service
if the distributor gets this information, do you think he can
coordinate with the milkman and say
and money flow in a supply chain, two, explain how to deal with
this is his pattern can you milk more or can you milk less,
all these things, do you think you can have it achieved
let's change focus assume the milk delivery is going on fine
the information from the customers coming perfectly,
there is no milk which is over delivered or under delivered,
but, the customer doesn't pay on time customer doesn't care or
he defaults on a payment customer is missing when the
payment has to be collected how do you think it's going to
impact the rest of the players? how do you think the distributor
is going to pay the salaries for his workers? if the customer
material flow disruptions learning outcomes: at the end of
hasn't given the money how do you think the distributor is
going to pay the milk man? is he going to end up borrowing money
from the bank or from some third party? to make sure that he
meets all his expenses on time or does he default to players
like the milkman? and if the milkman is defaulted on, do you
thing he can buy feed for the cows on time? can you see the
impact of irregular money flow? or on the other hand, the customer
may not default that he pays very irregularly sometimes once
a month, in a week, sometimes once in fifteen days sometimes he
doesn't pay for three months and then suddenly pays everything
this session the students should be able to, one, identify strategies
it it leads to a spike in money flow suddenly, whereas the
demand and the flow of the materials and information has
been normalized if money flow is going to have spikes,
it's going to have an impact on how each of the players
deals with their cash outflows why?
because the inflow is not stable
can you stabilize this in any way?
do you think you could stabilize it
at the individual player level
or do you think a lot of players have to get together and have to decide this
to deal with information and money flow disruptions,
can you find out the root cause? what's going around?
in any supply chain, you will have potential players who
default on payments or have extremely irregular payment cycles
how are you going to deal with this players? can you insulate
the other players in the chain from such irregular players?
information flow disruption, information flow can have three
kinds of problems problem number one, information just
doesn't reach, there is a break in the information flow
problem number two, wrong information reaches the wrong person
problem number three, too much of information overloading any
two, identify strategies to deal with material flow disruptions
into three equal parts, each part from the top to the bottom,
follow the order of green, yellow and red buffer resizing
is done once in sixty days if you resize very often, everybody
gets confused in the supply chain at the end of sixty
days, if a bulk of the stock has been in the green zone meaning
the top part it means your buffer is too big, if a bulk of
your buffer is in the red zone, it means your buffer is too small
it needs resizing goldratt gave a very simple rule
if your buffer is too big, reduce it by thirty-three percent if your buffer
is too small, increase it by thirty-three percent however, we can follow a
supply chain example what do you think would happen if the
slightly more scientific methodology and find out what's
the lead time and what's the demand? after all, buffer size is
determined by these two changes in lead time and changes in demand
over the sixty days, if you find out the peak lead time
and peak demand and resize the buffer, presto! you have the
right buffer size here is an exercise for all of you
assume you have a department store next to your house
and you pass on information at certain times,
he is out of stock, he is not able to supply
the materials you want, say a bar of soap,
farmer is not able to deliver the milk to the retailer because
or maybe some rice or some other provisions
how would you suggest that he maintain stock
to supply whatever you want whenever you wanted ?
how do you think the information you passed
should be recorded by him so that he doesn't get any
miscommunication or he doesn't forget? how do you think he
should standardize the payments you make to him?
use the principles you have learnt to come up with an answer
of a transport strike or what do you think would happen if his
cows suddenly start giving only fifty percent of the milk they
normally give? what do you think would happen if all the milk
reaches the retailer but, there is a retailer strike as a result
of which, much of the milk gets spoiled in the stores?
all this is an example of material disruption how do you think we
could handle material disruptions? the three methods of
doing it, method number one, we need to maintain a safety stock
the last video we discussed two important problems in supply
and a decoupling stock in each player of the supply chain has a
certain minimum stock, which offsets the variation in
material flow across the supply chain due to differing
capacities of different players to handle differing amounts of material
the second method of dealing with this is to have a
proper and an accurate forecasting methods
while this is easier said than done, because most players have no
clue as to the demand pattern of his customer the third method
is to use a pull system that toyota called the kanban
kanban is a lovely method to eliminate variations in demand patterns
chain flows namely, information and money today, we're going to
but apart from toyota and a few other companies, very few have
successfully implemented the kanban pull production there
must be some other method where we could achieve the same
material consistency in flow this is where we bring in goldratt
again goldratt's proposed a lovely method known as replenishment
in his replenishment, he created a method
that is both self-regulating and requires very
little computation also, if every player in the supply chain
follows the replenishment model, there is very little
communication that they need from the other players to be
consider a far more complex flow namely, the material flow across
able to function and manage their material stock
goldratt proposed three rules in his replenishment policy
rule number one, is the ordering policy in the ordering policy,
it's extremely simple let us say you have the same players in
the dairy supply chain let us assume the retailer is
ordering for one hundred litres of milk to the dairy farmer
today, the dairy farmer supplies one hundred litres of milk,
so tomorrow, he should milk only one hundred litres
anything extra is not done here
on day two, the farmer milks one hundred litres of milk but, the retailer
the supply chain in supply chain we have a famous punch line
asks only for eighty litres of milk what happens the farmer has
a stock of twenty litres of milk on day three, supposing the
retailer asks for one hundred and ten litres of milk the farmer already has
how many? twenty litres he is going to milk only as much as he has
supplied on day one simple isn't it when the farmer is
milking only as much as he supplies to the customer,
there is going to be a certain mismatch in the supply given to the customer
this is maintained by the second rule
what characterizes the ordering policy is frequent ordering,
preferably every single day there are certain people who
"supply chain is supposed to replace inventory with information"
order every three hours or even every hour
the faster the ordering is done, the more accurate is going to be
the material flow across the system put it in simple
words whatever goes out is the same amount that a player orders
from his supplier what happens if there is a variation in demand?
this will definitely mean that the supplier has to
make up for the difference in the stock for example, today
the customer orders for one hundred litres of milk, so the farmer tomorrow
milks exactly one hundred litres of milk what happens if the next
day the customer orders for 120? twenty litres less?
it's easier said than done in spite of all the
how do you make up for this?
this is where goldratt's gave his second rule,
the rule of maintaining a buffer this is probably the
easiest computation of buffer across so many inventory models
available across the operations management spectrum
the buffer is meant to absorb variations in demand from the customer side
these variations are impossible to predict because they're
highly random unless, both the customer and the supplier decide
to have a certain standard variation this doesn't happen
goldratt's buffer is computed using three variables f, l&d
advances in information technology, in spite of all the
"f" stands for the ordering frequency, "l" stands for the lead
time, and "d" stands for the demand the formula is the
demand multiplied by the sum of the lead time and the ordering frequency
ordering frequency could be every day, it
could be every month or it could be once in three months
but, here we maintain a steady ordering frequency we don't
order in irregular intervals the lead time should be as low as possible
but what happens when you have a variable lead time?
we assume that the largest lead time is used in this formula to
compute the buffer size the same goes for the demand
advances in electronic payments, material flow still remains the
the largest demand goes into this formula when the demand is
steady and the lead time is steady, it's extremely simple to
predict the buffer size here too, we have simplified the
entire process by using the largest lead time or the largest demand
we come to rule number three, buffer resizing
a buffer is fine, but are we having the right buffer size
is it too big is it too small? here's where goldratt gave his
third rule of "zones of a buffer" he divided the buffer into three zones
the green, the yellow, and the red these three do not
require complicated mathematics just take the buffer and divided
achilles heel of supply chains consider the same dairy
dear learners! welcome to this module on e-business processes for a
for supply chain supply chain maturity framework
consider a supply chain dealing with soaps
let's assume a retailer has ordered
for abc brand of soap, twenty cases along with thirty other brands of soap
abc brand alone doesn't arrive and you have a customer
walking in and asking for abc brand of soap, problems!
let's consider another case
the retailer has twenty cases of another brand of soap
let's call it xyz this brand of soap is not selling at all
it's sitting on your shelf and you can do nothing about it
seamless supply chain integrating various players in a
you can't use the shelf for anything else
let's consider another example
assume there is a brand called pqr, the customer consistently
complains that the pqr has quality issues but, this
information does not reach the manufacturer yes, no idea
but the customer is complaining about quality
we have seen three problems
why do you think these problems happen?
are they supply chain problems? or can they just be written away?
let's consider another case
supply chain into a single functioning unit is a big
the factory of soap brand xyz
dispatches the soap to the retailer
the transport breaks down on the way
soap does not arrive at the retailer spot
this is because of heavy rains which have damaged roads
you think you have a problem here?
let's consider another case
a factory has shut down on account of workers strike
they stopped manufacturing for weeks at a stretch
there is a huge demand for the soap at the retailers end
challenge to meet for most supply chains here, we take a
but, stocks are just not coming will it be possible for the retailer to
contact other stockist or other transportation people to supply
these extra stocks on time what kind of information do you think
is essential to deal with the problems mentioned? how do you think you
can achieve the task of giving the customer precisely the brand
of soap that he wants? what should be the attitude of
various players, could be the transportation, could be the
factory, could be the retailer? how should they behave with each
other so that the final customer is served with the product he or she wants?
do you think it's possible for the players to collaborate at all?
look at how this might be achieved using a standard approach?
what are the benefits of having such an
initiative among all the players that they collaborate with one
another? all the problems discussed are because of a lack
of collaboration and integration between the various players in the supply chain
the lack of coordination leads to different
players in the supply chain taking different kinds of
decisions totally out of sync with each other
as a result, the voice of the final customer is
drowned somewhere along the way as it moves upwards
towards the upstream players in the supply chain
learning objectives: understand the supply chain maturity framework,
this kind of problem, this kind of problem
leads to all kinds of wrong information flows, wrong
stocking, excess delays, wrong products being shipped and what not?
this initiative that is taken to bind all the players in
the supply chain into one single working unit is known as
external integration in the supply chain
external integration, though extremely simple to understand
and conceive, has been extremely difficult for most modern supply
chains to achieve we hardly have any supply chain out there
which is fully externally integrated most of the firms
explain external integration strategies in the supply chain
which are working on supply chain integration in india and
the world over have achieved only internal integration
we are still way off the mark when it comes to external integration
this includes some of the leading brands of soaps,
consumer goods, fmcg industries and what not can you believe it?
some of these firms who have invested billions of dollars in
supply chain integration are yet to achieve results in getting a
properly integrated supply chain on the external front?
very few players have managed to crack the external integration barrier
one such firm happens to be toyota motor corporation
learning outcomes: at the end of this session, the student
it's one of the rare auto companies, which does not push or dump vehicles
on to the dealers and distributors it works on a
perfect pull and this has been accomplished because of great
deal of external supply chain integration none of the other
auto companies in india have been able to achieve such a high
degree of external supply chain integration we have considered
some problems in supply chain because of integration issues
what kind of information do you think is required to deal
with this situation? what is the infrastructure required
if we are to sort out these problems?
should be able to, one, adapt supply chain maturity framework to real life
what do you think the various players should have as an attitude
if we had to deal with this problem collectively?
do you think it's possible to get all the players to
collaborate with one another in spite of differing attitudes,
differing goals, differing priorities and differing problems?
do you think they are going to accept talking to
each other or do you think each one is going to set a few of
their problems on the back burner so that the overall supply chain is benefitted?
what do you think will be the benefits of getting
all the players to collaborate in the first place?
supply chains, to identify external integration strategies
welcome to the second session on external integration strategies for supply chains
is publicly available to all the players in the supply chain
what we're trying to do here is improve the visibility of the
performance parameters of each single player in the supply chain
this voluntary sharing of information is vital if
the supply chain integration is to happen at all and lastly,
improve the flow of information among the partners there are two
issues with this: issue number one, the right information is
not reaching the right player or issue number two, too much of
information is getting dumped on certain players, too much of
information is as good as no information at all
do we need to integrate all the
each and every player should consciously decide, how much information
should i give? where should i give? to whom should i give? so
that the integration efforts are achieved when this kind of an
initiative, the four of them are done over a period of time
with constant effort to deal with any problems which may happen,
by the way, they keep happening all the time
the supply chain soon becomes externally integrated
this is what toyota has done for the last forty years
it has taken them that long to have external integration
processes or is it sufficient if we integrate a few critical and vital processes?
the good news, we do have a standard
procedure to achieve external integration
this has been proposed as a model the model is known as
supply chain maturity reference model this model was proposed
by mccormack in his lovely publication on supply chain maturity
mccormack classified maturity into five stages
this is a lovely measure of agreation , stage is called
ad hoc, absolutely no processes there is no definition of what's
how are we to achieve external supply chain integration?
going on anywhere stage one, people start making definitions
processes are defined but, there's hardly any connection
between the processes stage number three, the supply chain
is linked meaning the firm starts connecting to their
suppliers and to their customers but, predominantly the
various departments within they are connected
stage number four, the firm is finally integrated with its supplier
and its customer and stage number five, standard supply chain
it's in this particular stage that all the players in the supply
chain finally get connected, usually using the cloud as a base
what efforts do you think we need to put in to achieve it?
in the supply chain maturity reference model level one, talks
about totally disintegrated supply chain, it has no
coordination anywhere we hardly find a supply chain like that
today, most firms have some degree of integration
level two, and level three they talk about the internal integration of the
supply chain it's useless to talk about external integration,
if internal integration hasn't taken place in the first in the
supply chain reference maturity model, level one, talks about a
totally disintegrated supply chain no process talks to any
other process it's very difficult to get such a supply
what are the areas where we should put in these efforts?
chain in today's world most firms have put in a lot of effort
to have at least some degree of integration level two and level three,
talk about the internal integration of the supply chain,
meaning different processes inside the firm, source, make,
deliver, return, information, etc are talking to each other to
some degree at least this has been a concerted effort which
has been deliberately worked on this is the foundation for
external integration external integration is measured in
stages four and five stage four, talks about integrating with one
level supplier and one level customer, while stage five tries
is it possible or is it just a pipe dream? how long do you think you
to bring all the players in the supply chain onto one single page
a good example of such an integrated supply chain is the
uk dairy industry this is an amazing industry where they have
integrated everyone ranging from the milkman to the transport to
the retailer, and even the prices have been put online for
everyone to see we have seen the five levels in a
supply chain maturity how do we achieve it? ajmera and cook
have proposed a four-step model phase, we call it the
competitive phase each member of the supply chain is striving to
make profits for himself, they don't care about the other person
should put in these efforts to start seeing tangible results?
sure, they just negotiate with that partner
where they feel that partner's policies and procedures can
improve their profitability much of the supply chain in the
world is like that today these people are working with
there is no collaboration
we have purpose such people to phase two this phase is
called the communication phase in the communication phase, they
start talking to each other for the first time with a goal on
improving the overall supply chain and not just their
individual profitability, they are looking at a win-win,
what do you think is a good workable
not that "i win, and i don't care what happens to you"
the next phase is the cooperative phase once they start talking
to each other, they say, "hey i can help you out somewhere or
you can help me out somewhere" why don't we just talk to each
other and try helping each other out these are the rudimentary
seeds for the next stage, which is called collaboration
the difference between the cooperative phase and the
collaborative phase is: in cooperative phase, they share a
few resources in the collaborative phase,
they jointly use the resource and jointly work towards problem
external integration in modern supply chains?
it's just goes far beyond just sharing of resources here as
well, the maturity model gives us step-by-step process to
improve integration remember, external integration
will happen if and only if each and every player puts in
external integration effort it cannot be done by just one or
two players putting in all the effort and the rest of them just
come along as a baggage the supply chain reference model
talks about four important steps in actually achieving external integration
step one, work on improving integration with the supplier, meaning look
at your upstream processes and align it in such a way that the
do you think we have any standard procedure out there,
supplier is able to get a free flow of the three important
elements namely information, material and money step two, work
towards your customer what we did towards the supplier,
remember, we are the supplier for the customer both the customer
and the supplier should try to use a collaborative effort to
improve the three flows point number three is slightly different
we try to improve the visibility remember session
one, when we talked about measuring the supply chain
performance, we had discussed that we should measure the total
dollar days and inventory dollar days, meaning that information
whereby, supply chains can improve their external integration?
hi students, this is dr arthi, associate professor department
first one, may be- collect newspaper clippings for the past
six months to get insights on the role of logistics for an
effective global operation visit a nearby global retail
outlet or franchise business at your locality and list out the
various supply chain factors involved in the daily operations
of the businesses the learning outcomes of these objectives are
achieved and we can make it complete with your practical
assignment
of technology on supply chain, enabled to achieve supply chain
coordination and the end of the module the student shall have
the ability to analyze the role of logistics in international
perspective, familiar with the forces that impact global supply
chain operations, successfully implement efficient and
responsive supply chains, develop effective coordination in supply
chain management, and you can collaborate even with business
partners to deliver value and competitive advantage in
session one of this module, we would focus on the learning
objective to understand the concept and role of supply chain
of business administration, avinashilingam institute for
globalization welcome to the session on global supply chain
as students or as professionals, it is necessary in this
competitive business environment an expansion of
standards unclear uncertainty, complexity and
ambiguity how supply chain management becomes challenging
and its impact on the globalized business environment this module
focuses on understanding how to streamline the supply chain so
that it can deliver maximum customer value at the lowest
possible cost by supplying the correct product in the required
quantity to the right place at the needed time this session
home science and higher education for women now, we
will take you through the fundamentals and the basic
concepts of supply chain globalization and global supply
chain refers to the network created among various global
companies producing handling and distributing specific materials
and products since companies expand their global operations,
complex issues like supply chain disruptions are experienced
thus companies need to manage supply chain relationship at
global level from the stated definition is evident that it
comprises of a network of both processes and entities, supply
chain management and globalization are intertwined
would focus on supply chain globalization the overall
because of changes in the business models eventually,
globalization gives access to a lot of customers and very many
sources of procurement the way to have a global reach does
require an understanding of different markets which
includes the potential partners, the varied risks, and applicable
regulations recently, the companies in sectors like retail
to consumer goods, high technology to automotive, have
realized that a supply chain engages more cost to getting the
products to the hands of the potential customers it
functions to provide a great understanding on how the supply
learning objectives of this module includes understand the
chain globalization transforms the corporate strategies into
daily activities, both outside and within the organization the
supply chain system is one which ultimately satisfies or
disappoints the clients this can give a broader perspective
on what supply chain globalization is, it gives
emphasis to information sharing and also added activities which
starts from raw materials to the last stage of distribution
there are certain advantages of globalized supply chain the
first one is opportunity to expand a globalized market will
provide the business a lot of opportunities to work with a
concept and role of supply chain globalization, facilitate you
different set of workers materials and products this
method of selection of goods and services will mean to provide an
opportunity to select high quality with a low cost option
the second one is identifying diverse customer in niche
markets globalization provides for more materials and labourers
it also aids the new customers in a new market with new needs
the third one is growth avenues advanced technologies and a
shrinking globe means that it is easier for the companies to
grow when the business seems to be expand, it is clear that the
borders also expands which gives an added advantage the
towards successful implementation of supply chain
businesses and corporations in terms of business efficiency and
also profits the fourth one is saving money the added benefit
of globalization is that it increases the possibility for
varied materials, workers and also for transportation these
can add up to more profit as the manufacturer or the producer can
choose among the best possible alternative for improving
profits supply chain globalization is ruled by four
forces the first one is global market forces which includes
global business environment that provides larger market for the
goods and services the second one is technological forces the
management, acquaint on the various aspects of supply chain
advanced cutting edge technologies reduces the
hindrances managing supply chains globally the third one
is global cost forces the cost advantages at global production
sites can be used to produce high quality and low cost
products the final one is political and macro economic
forces the companies can capitalize on trade agreements,
stable government situations, exempt policies, exchange rate
utilization, etc a globalized marketplace has been both a boon
and bane while the new markets have been ready to open
up, there are larger risks involved which could actually
globalization in manufacturing services sector, equipped to
have a greater impact on the survival capability of the
company and also has all of these risks can go hand in hand
with each other, it is now very much critical for all the
manufacturers to improve their visibility on both their and
also their suppliers with so much risk, the supply chain
system and global scale and help to mitigate the risk which is
worth the investment the next recession we can discuss about
specific issues related to supply chain globalization and
manufacturing and services sector
for a better understanding, you can take up an assignment, the
take supply chain decisions, provide insights on the impact
welcome back to session two on supply chain globalization the
technology in creating end to end global supply chain
solutions and how to make effective coordination of supply
chains we have now achieved the learning outcome of how to
differentiate the various aspects of supply chain
globalization in manufacturing and services sector and we
could now identify the importance of global supply
chains in the bonus sector i have got an assignment for you
at the end of this session to activate your think tank, there
is an exercise for you all to prepare a small supply chain
network of any company of your choice from the data available
about global supply chain and manufacturing, it actually takes
from an internet source thank you see you all in the next
session till then actively engaged in the assignment given
manufacturing to the middle and all the suppliers of the
components to the left though the suppliers of the components
can be the most important for the ultimate designing of the
manufactured products in supply chain the other utilities and
services cannot be the overall contributors of the cost of
operations when we look at the businesses in a larger
perspective, where the countries are dependent on the neighboring
countries for the raw materials and the important spare
components, the situation might be a challenging task for the
learning objectives of session two would include acquainting
operations team as well as the management as we all know that
globalized supply chain facilitates production in one
part of the world and it is all transported to another side of
the world, where the demand for these products are high in this,
we need to understand that all the individual specific
components of the products are being manufactured or sourced
from various countries right from the smallest smartphones to
bigger products like cars or high tech machines are being
imported by various countries
firstly, the modern manufacturers make use of all
you all on the various aspects of supply chain globalization in
the available opportunities and possibilities to rule the
competition sometimes completely dependent on the contractors can
seem to be more affordable, but there can be a much greater risk
involved as soon as the goods leave the factories, all the
decisions which are related to the system of distribution can
place a greater impact on the managerial decisions relating to
the investments in infrastructure of the
distribution and also gives an idea of transportation
contractors secondly, the quality improvement programs
like six sigma is constantly introducing some changes to the
manufacturing and services sector and equip you all to take
dynamics of supply chain which requires collaboration to a
greater extent with clients and suppliers than ever before
those producers who are using the just in time ordering system
can integrate order processing system directly with other
companies system through virtual networks it can also be noticed
that in a just in time supply chain, the orders will be
processed in a mode which is automatic between the servers or
computers and both the customer and supplier ends one among
this would place orders based on the electronic based inventory
levels and it has an important role in the payment process and
better supply chain decisions as we have refreshed up with the
managing the queues of the new orders in the delivery order
queues and also these are done without no human interaction
for example, in automotive industry, the world's important
sector which is highly driven by globalization, car manufacturers
face high customer desires in terms of designs, technological
advancements, quality etc mercedes benz has gone a huge
investment on reorganization offers global supply chain
network, which has reduced the cost of each victory by twenty percent
they see continuous advancement in its global production network
towards efficient and flexible supply chain operations globally
general concepts of supply chain globalization, and the forces
aiming and growth the smooth material flow is facilitated by
several service providers across the globe and also collaborate
with them for technological innovations they follow a
strategy by named case which has expanded as connectivity,
autonomous, shared and services and electric which necessitates
wider supply network focusing on globalization we will now look
into the supply chain globalization services sector
even if the traditional supply chain management model is very
common in manufacturing, the service industry also has the
same concept of supply chains in a nutshell, the service
behind global supply chains in the earlier session, we can now
oriented supply chains require very high tech management with
regard to the alarming trend towards the outsourcing of
business processes and the idea of shifting or taking these
processes to offshore locations, it is important for all the
organizations to concentrate on changing the avenues for
procuring these services first, there are a number of barriers
to address if service purchasing is to be improved the factors
that need to be addressed in service sector supply chain
issues are a major aspect is related to lack of service focus
resources, information technology support, outsourcing,
understand the realities of supply chain globalization, with
requirements identification, and overall view on the service
spending areas continuous growth in the supply base for example,
deutsche bank has initiated green supply chain framework
through which it insisted its client to submit energy
efficiency for the products the bank procured smart machines,
recycling waste, had contracts for renewable energy,
it has improved the eco efficiency performance of that
institution supply chain globalization has its own
advantages and disadvantages in both manufacturing and service
sector it is just not that globalization can create
respect to manufacturing and services sector what is supply
prosperity, it is equally true that the supply chains can
create a lot of problems hence, the implications in this is that
all the members involved in the supply chain can take necessary
precautions and make sure that the entire network is not being
disturbed we cannot ignore the globalization and so we must
take the necessary measures to protect us from the hazards of
the process this is how the contingency and the continuity
planning play a vital role and also the proficiencies of the
stakeholders regulate the success of the supply chains
globally the next session, we will look into the role of
chain globalization in manufacturing? when we talk
welcome back to the last session of the module supply chain globalization
coordination in supply chain management the learning outcome
is completely fulfilled only when you join a business,
you can very well cooperate and collaborate with business
partners to deliver value and competitive advantage
with this, we come to the end of this module
thank you best wishes
composed of several entities like end customers, components
suppliers, a material product manufacturer, raw material,
service or a producer of services and even distributors
supply chain globalization structures largely changes based
on: the demand, technology needs, business focus, and equipment
it definitely includes various other flows as well as
new entities payment flows from customers toward suppliers,
materials ordered and services move from suppliers towards customers
likewise, information also flows both ways
supply chains can also be notice to flow in reverse, which begins
session three the learning objectives of session three would be:
with those who would like to return such items as components
for replacement or repair all the return goods which are to
be considered for remanufacturer and also the
various other obsolete goods for disposal or recycling
the forward chain, as well as the reverse chain both comprise of
cash or credits and also information flows
the methodical way to understand the various stages of supply chain
globalization and the influential factors are presented
strategic planning: every efficient strategy for
supply chain starts with a long- term and solid decision making
to provide insights on the impact of technology
this level of strategy places the start-ups to think of
a complete supply chain network and it provides a greater stride
to supply chain globalization issues to be considered at this
level can be comprehended as: selecting strategic facilities
required for the business, to create a system of transporters,
and a very strong supplier who are reliable along with a good
logistics network the major impact of the inventory
management system focus on (it) programs and systems can be made
more effective the next stage is tactical management
in this tactical level, businesses always make a very short-term decision
and supply chain globalization, to understand
the planning begins at the basic strategy level, but
all the other process are well defined in the tactical level
these tactical decisions have a good impact on minimizing risks
and controlling cost at this level, the major focus is to
attend to the customer choices and to achieve the best value
the most common concerns at this stage are: contracts for
procurement of the materials and services, production guidelines
and contracts which can help to meet quality standards,
inventory management, including storage and end-product distribution,
financially viable value- addition practices in
what is supply chain coordination and related
comparison to the competitors the last level is the
operational level the operational level of supply
chain globalization is the most obvious one these are the real
time process which keeps the supply chain active
the key mistake or the drawback of any company is to leap directly into
operational management by not focusing on the plans at the
strategic and tactical levels best operational level processes
can be a result of concrete strategical and tactical planning
tactics of best operational level management can include
points like: satisfying the demand through regular
decision and how it can be achieved supply chains
forecasting, production operations which include
scheduling and efficient management of work-in-process,
screening of all activities related to logistics and order fulfillment,
compensating the damages or losses which occurs
with vendors, suppliers and clients, handling both the
outgoing and incoming materials or products and the on-hand inventories
effective supply chain strategies are certainly
a result of a holistic operational approach when all the three
levels of supply chain globalization are paid due
attention, each member of the supply chain will be benefited
generally are composed of several entities like
it is evident that of late the supply chains have become much
more longer and more complex so that the severity and occurrence
of a supply chain disruptions are increasing to a greater extent
there are numerous steps that both government as well as
the industry groups can make together to bring up supply
chains in a more vibrant and successful manner to help these
both entities consumers can cooperate all private sector
companies can back up the broad measures, but a very proactive
steps should be taken for the supply chains to be more strong and tough
as an end note, when all of a sudden a greater
end customers, components suppliers, a material product
disruption happens in organization, the businesses
have to carry forward some mitigation plans which can bring
more market share to them than that of the competitors
in the globalized scenario it is evident that the supply chains
formed or created during earlier stages need to be reformed for the
actual operation to face formidable challenges of vuca environment
the change element of "dynamic operations" can only
be a possible solution to accomplish this i have a class
activity for you all i would like to assign yourself with a
specific role of a retailer or a wholesaler, operating from
manufacturer, raw material, service or a producer of
different part of the world for various components of the
products to be manufactured and negotiate the supply chain contracts
you can include decisions pertaining to pricing,
inventorying and ordering empower your thinking by applying the
latest advancement in technology this can be prepared
as an instrument containing questions for better
manufacturer supplier negotiation this accentuates
your learning about the negotiation environment in a globalized scenario
dear students! at the end of the session
you have gained ability to develop effective
services and even distributors supply chains generally are
hi, this is dr arthi, associate professor, department
goods, complaints of regulations, analysis and
sourcing, source of finance, purchase order processing, enumerate
quality standards inventory management, disposal of waste
products raising invoice for payment in the overall supply
chain process, procurement terminates once organization has
process the goods to make a profit, the cost of procuring
goods must be at most lesser cost than the selling price of
the products less than the cost which are connected with
processing and selling them thus procurement is a broader
term and purchasing is just a subcomponent the procurement
chains and the outcome of the entire session on purchasing in
process includes three major functions categorized as
purchase order processing, receipt, confirmation, and
invoice verification in simple terms the objective of
efficient procurement process is to reduce the operating cost
one of the components that can reduce operating cost is
decreasing purchase cost retailers relay on specific
supplies to faster delivery to the customer expectations so
that the cost of holding costly inventories in stores can be
avoided for example, electronic stores require faster delivery
of consumer durables to reduce high inventory cost the global
global supply chains would be to recognize purchasing function as
supply chain includes players performing in the process of
logistics, purchasing, operations and market channels
procurement includes both direct and indirect cost direct costs
are those required to produce or deliver the service that is
expected by the customers indirect costs are associated
with costs involved in day to day activities of the business
such as office equipment, stationaries and so on coming
to purchasing, it is a sub function of procurement
purchasing simply is buying and selling of goods and services
purchasing is a transaction oriented functional procurement
a strategic business enabler, gain clarity among the functions
now let's understand the terminology sourcing sourcing
refers snack to finding a source to supplying the goods and
services sourcing is considered to be a sub function of
procurement when procurement is related to acquiring goods and
services, whereas sourcing aims at identifying a competent to
supplier for the goods
as the profits for business can be assured to the best range of
suppliers, sourcing is considered to be the first important step
taken by the business before the core activity of selling the
supply chain starts with procurement and stops when the
of purchase procurement and sourcing, adequate knowledge
goods are brought to the premises for the production of
goods or services if a company is in making office furniture
procurement is sourcing the raw materials needed to design the
furniture supply chain is the entire process involved in
sourcing producing and delivering the cabins notice
boards, seating, filing cabinets or other office furniture given
in the catalog to satisfy the customers this session is
getting insights on the importance of global purchasing
and basic understanding of terminologies like procurement,
purchase and sourcing thus we try to achieve the outcome of
about global purchasing trends and suitability to business
gaining clarity to enhance our knowledge to proceed with
further topics
needs, apply practically the appropriate global purchasing
decisions to ensure organizational success and you
can easily design global purchase strategies as core
capabilities of organization we are going to focus on
session 1,with the first two learning objectives i'm happy
of business administration of avinashilingam institute for
to address you all in this session with a focus on the
objectives to understand how important global purchasing is
identify the differences with procurement function your full
attention will help you to prepare for few exercises at the
end of the session tracing back to early one thousand, nine hundred and seventy s, purchasing was a
basic function rather than playing a strategic role in the
organization we place the entelibrate attention on vital
core competencies, smes and even many big organizations don't
consider purchasing as one of their core petencies global
supply chains swirl around with purchasing as a
home science and higher education for women i'm very
vital function purchasing occurs in the crucial areas of
the supply chain that is the inbound or an upstream the
purchasing function involves the process of procuring raw
materials, components, monitoring work in process products or
services and which requires a smooth integration in the
production cycle for international organizations the
different types of purchasing strategies involved in the
global purchasing are outsourcing and multisourcing,
global customer relationship management, worldwide channel
management, order fulfillment and delivery, global supplier
happy to take you through the module on purchasing in global
selection and global supply networks, which is depicted in
figure one hence, global purchasing is integral in the
global supply chain management that is connected with the
buying of goods and services or information required by the
multinational companies around the world it is to be noted
that ninety percentage of global demand is not fully met by local
supplies and global supply chains will soon account for
twenty-five percent of multi national firms performance further, the supply
chains need to develop forty-three percent more global in the next decade, so
that a firm's competitive edge is sharpened in the global
supply chains this is divided into three sessions and all the
arena it is imperative to locate global operations and
develop need based global supply chains which require strategic
planning and control developing global supply chains that
provide quick access to the resources, the organization
currently needs or potentially aim for to achieve its strategic
objectives further, the overall supply chain and inventory cost
can be reduced which can improve the purchase process and thereby
help the management to maintain better communication with the
vendor as to identification of the materials in the delivery
process and payment to the international logistics and the
three sessions will focus on the following learning objectives
provision of the global supply chain are major building blocks
of development of international trade the needs of the global
market are widening, allowing for more purchase options and
expect sustainable efforts from the organization so
strategically utilize the opportunities for example,
walmart is a great example of global supply chain development,
aiming, greater efficiency and even creating supply chains,
which has helped increasing purchasing power of the bottom
of the pyramid customers walmart has achieved a
competitive edge by administering the coordination
understand the importance of global purchasing, identify
of the raw materials to end customer global supply chain to
maximize efficiencies and total costs that is to provide
greater total value than many other companies, which is a
competitive advantage when compared to other firms they
have an efficient network of global supply chains which offer
low cost versions of products monitored by the bottom of the
pyramid customers strategically, within the integrated global
supply chain of multinational corporations it is predicted
that purchasing as a function will become thirteen percent more globalized
as crude in the five years period between two thousand and thirteen and eighteen and
differences with procurement function, comprehend global
twenty-nine percent more globalized in the next ten years by two thousand and twenty-three the
important object of global supply chain management is to
integrate the marketplace, distribution network, procurement
activity, manufacturing, processing, assembly process
etc in such a way that customers experience greater
satisfaction at lower cost supply chain management focuses
heavily on operations management, logistics,
procurement, demand and supply planning, transportation process
warehousing order fulfillment , we will see the next
aspect of learning objective of differentiation among the
purchasing trends, illustrations across global purchase options,
terminologies of purchasing, procurement and sourcing
procurement is a managerial function procurement involves
acquiring of products and services, especially for the
undertaking business operations it includes a number of
activities right from identifying the need of goods
and services to its acquisition to complete the production
process to know the difference in these terminologies, we need
to focus on the basic active in each function procurement
involves activities like identify appropriate suppliers,
design payment conditions, negotiating prices, buying
enumerate critical success factors for purchasing in global
supply_chain_management_9906
with sixty-five percent being sourced externally
the next decision is to back to purchase either domestically or globally
this leads as to take on the types of purchasing
where and how? and the four choices for purchasing strategies are
domestic internal purchasing,
global internal purchasing, domestic external purchasing
and global external purchasing
let's see each one in detail domestic internal purchasing
it is a type when a multinational corporation buys
raw material from one of its own associates
it is interesting and important to note
that produces them in one of the company's factories located locally
this is referred to as domestic in house sourcing
global internal purchasing:
in this type of purchasing a multinational corporation gets
its raw materials from
one of its subsidiary company which is produced
in one of the firm's factories outside the country
this is referred to as off shore subsidiary sourcing
domestic external purchasing:
in this type the company's purchases
from the article written by robert trent and robert monica
raw materials from one of its suppliers
that produces them in one of its factories in the home country
this is simply called us purchasing from vendors
global external purchasing this occurs when the corpration gets
its raw material from one of its vendors which is made in their global factories
this is otherwise referred to as offshore outsourcing
it is expected that there would be a
continued progress in external purchases
in the future man home countries functional groups
will be placed globally to take care of global supply links
in their article written in mit sloan management review in two thousand and five
global sourcing is due to free trade policies and the supply basis can be expanded
there are other options like outsourcing,
insourcing, nearshoring, multi sourcing,
home sourcing, co sourcing,
and we will see one by one in detail
let's start with outsourcing:
outsourcing successfully when trusted permits between buyer and vendor
outsourcing is a process
when an international corporation purchases materials or parts
from any of its suppliers that produces them locally or globally,
where they have mentioned the
for example, chemicals and plastics travel distances to reach india and china
in sourcing, this is a strategy which is followed
when companies experience poor quality raw materials, late deliveries etc
in that case, the company itself produces
its requirements internally this will reduce the lead time
and can reach customers fast it is also known as back sourcing
nearshoring happens when there is transfer of business
activity or information technology processes to suppliers
in a neighboring country, often between the countries sharing same borders
this strategy facilitates global external purchasing
seven characteristics of outstanding global purchasing strategies
multi sourcing is a strategy followed when a company gets
parts of its business activities accomplished
and it services from the ideal set of local and external service providers
based on the corporate goals
home sourcing which is also called as home shoring
refers to a company transferring service industry employment
from their offices to employees work from home
with appropriate communication technology,
who can be located anywhere in the world
this depicts a future purchasing scenario
they are executive commitment to global purchasing,
co-sourcing occurs when there is sharing of a process of function,
which uses both its own employees from inside the firm
and an external supplier to perform certain tasks
when there is a goal compatibility between the buyer and the supplier
generally used for non value adding activities
for example, co-sourcing for a consulting firm can be to
utilize multilingual capabilities
the organizations in future will apply
value engineering techniques like
early supplier involvement in case of new product development,
rigorous and well defined processes,
vendor managed inventory services to keep customers
which minimizes the carrying cost and allows for co managed inventories
supplier co-location is another strategy wherein
suppliers employees are deputed in the buyers organization
strategic alliance development between the buyer
and the supplier jointly work for a win win alliance creating
a transparent environment for mutual gains
finally, it is apply a procurement system
when there is a large volume of material purchase globally,
which can be made at ease with advanced technologies
availability of needed resources,
which promotes ethical purchasing
and helps to establish green supply chain
all these aspects related to the different purchase options
would reduce material costs and throughput time
therefore delighting the customers with the session,
we have a few questions put forth to recalculate what was discussed
we can just ponder upon two aspects, the future purchasing pattern,
how it is going to be in the hospitality industry
and we can try to enumerate on the different types of purchase decisions
possible to manage supply chains effectively
integration through information technology
thank you we will meet in the next session
supportive organizational design,
, we are going to focus on the second session
structured approaches to communication,
methodologies for measuring savings
you try to follow picture one which depicts
the purchasing activities at different levels
let's start by highlighting the five levels of purchasing
in level 1,the companies in this level
exhibit a special characteristic feature of
having their operations only at the domestic level
most of these companies often
keep their production closer to the domestic markets,
on purchasing in global supply chains
even for the purpose of purchasing raw materials,
components, parts and other requirements for their operations
for example, an indian firm purchases
the castings for its business from another indian firm
such companies are home oriented
as they purchase all their inputs for their production process,
within the home country and they do not engage outside the country
if you just look at levels two and three from the figure,
it is in contrast to level one companies
these companies in level two and three
hope the assignments given in the previous session
involved in international purchasing in various degrees and forms
level two companies engage in international purchasing activities only when need arises
hence, their approach to international purchasing is reactive
and disintegrated among the purchasing locations within the form
and across the various units of the form like
strategic business units or functional units
companies at level three engage in international purchasing
as a regular integral part of their business
they believe that they international purchasing
is a part of their overall supply chain management strategy
was very useful, and you could collect data and have gained knowledge
they realize that a well defined international purchasing
strategy can enhance their competitive position in the market place
let's see the companies in level four and five
at both these levels the company is involved in global purchasing, but in varied levels
in level four the global purchasing activities of the firm takes
place worldwide with the supply chain
this involves coordinated and integrated purchasing strategies for
the purchasing activity worldwide across the form buying locations
matters level five involves in global purchasing not only with the supply chain,
but also with the functional group of the firm located worldwide
welcome back to the second session of purchasing in global supply chains
hence, the company brings about a global integration the purchase of
common items, purchasing process
identification of supplier and other functions
this indicates that the company ought to construct
a global design which will integrate
global logistics,global processes and worldwide market channels
this will result in an effective management of supply chain globally,
looking into the data for the domestic
international global purchasing for two thousand and thirteen and also for two thousand and eighteen
and a forecast is also projected for 2023,from the figure
this session will focus on the two aspects of
clearly there is a movement,
such as level one focuses on engaging solely in local purchasing activities
in level one we see a downward trend from thirty-three percent of
the companies involved in only home based purchasing in two thousand and thirteen
to twenty-six percent in two thousand and twenty-three level two shows a steady forecast
with twenty-two percent of the company's concentrate in international purchasing
activities only when need arises
level four scenario shows about fifteen percent of the company's
allocating their purchasing efforts over the next decade
the significant changes based on the opinion from purchasing professionals
global purchasing trends and different global purchase options
will mainly in the level three and level five categories
the forecast data reveals that the companies would actively involved
in a global purchasing and supply chains globally
and also functionally groups to capitalize on the strengths of the global supply chains
let's see the different types of purchasing strategy
apart from the strategies of global purchasing discussed earlier,
like the domestic and international
purchasing decision has other levels in which the selection of a decision
will be highly compatible for the organization
figure two illustrates the basic options that are available
we are going to travel from domestic
the adaptability of masaki kotaeb and kristian helsen's model
for the selection of decision is to be discussed in the section
the purchasing options may be related to the inputs
product assembly or produce within a country to serve the internal markets
the decision relating to the use of suppliers from local
or cross border markets for components of finished products is another crucial one
the purchasing decision making tree presence
to decision points of internal purchasing
this is external purchasing it is shown that
thirty-five percent of purchasing in multinational corporations today is internal,
to international to global purchasing at different levels
let me take you through the last lap of this module on purchasing
to global suppliers in support of global purchasing in this
case, a global supplier is not having different global
locations but assisted buying firms worldwide
requirements competitively the seven th success factors related
to performance measurement systems in this organization
need to gauge the performance to effectively manage global
purchasing like reward system to employees involved, maintain
transparency in global purchasing agreements in terms
of performance gains the final point is related to
communication and coordination mechanisms the current day
of michigan state university which is conducted through the
supply chains experienced disruptions thus demanding
appropriate communication and coordination system to support
global purchasing missing links can be avoided through regular
review meetings, use of internet technology colocation of
experts, continuous strategy development and efforts if
there is no communication or coordination performance gets
affected and cost savings becomes impossible if a company
rightly focus in these eight success areas, the overall global
purchasing effort will be highly successful with the knowledge
on purchasing trends different purchase options, critical
global procurement and supply chain benchmarking initiative,
success factors in mind now you are well equipped to design
strategies for purchasing in global supply chains we close
this module successfully achieving the learning outcome
specify wish you all good luck
wherein data had been collected from more than two hundred companies
which has enlisted eight factors as strategic to success for
purchasing in global supply chains we will go through the
eight factors one by one the first factor is organizational
support structure organizations as you all know or neural
networks, which has a lot of information processing before
decision making, the organization structure need to
be flexible to allow global purchasing the organization can
in global supply chains madden will discuss about the success
plan for cross functional teams, cross locational teams, global
purchase offices, offices to oversea global purchase
operations the ezile global activities will ensure great
success in achieving the targets the organizations can follow can
cad mix model with four layers namely govern which is related
to decision making and that related to innovative
infrastructure, orchestrate and the end to end process and
execute to achieve operational outcomes the second point is
related to executive commitment the important aspect for
purchasing in global supply chain is the executive
factors for purchasing in global chains and fulfill the outcome
commitment in developing a well formulated global purchase
process, budget allocation, expert availability to handle
operations, performance scores to monitor exhibitors, effective
advisory board to guide the process, sharing the gains
achieved among the members of the organization global supply
chains are emerging as dynamic process networks which requires
high commitment at levels and team management will enable best
response to market requirements the third one is related to
organizational resource availability the integrated and
efficient working of the supply chains need efficient people are
of analyzing and creating purchase decisions which should
involved at various processes the entire business activities
are heavily dependent on supply chain stretching operational
excellence the organization's to have experts with
capabilities and knowledge, futuristic technology to support
supply chain operations as well as finance appropriation for a
total alignment with corporate goals the fourth success
factors related to information systems and technology the
technological innovations in supply chains will effect the
way organizations buy and sell in future the intelligent and
smart systems and managing supply change globally will
stratergically suit the organization the critical
support global purchasing as the world is moving towards virtual
supply chains, resulting in real time actionable data,
simplifying supply chains eliminate unnecessary links and
enhance customer communication the fifth point is related to
well defined global sourcing process it is to be noted thata
right approach to and processes for global purchasing is
essential in this context, let's ponder on an important
process attached with the order fulfillment and delivery, which
is the last part of supply chain the purchasing strategy
emanating from the headquarters namely center lead purchasing
success factors that we are going to deliberate upon will
which anchors purchasing both domestic and global order
fulfillment in case of delivery both domestic as well as global
delivery we define order fulfillment as purchase dealing
with business to customers such as purchasing between entities
cannot boyd, markham frolic and thomas halt suggest four
different strategies we will discuss as projected in the
given two by two matrix there are four quadrants namely, fully
extended, centralized, extended, semi extended and decoupled on
the either sides of x and y axis, we have order fulfillment and
delivery respectively ford motor company is going to be our
help you to design global purchase strategies with the
example, based on which we'll discuss the four quadrants ford
motor company, as we all know, is based in michigan, which has
wide global operations and works on different options for order
fulfillment and delivery, which follows centralized global
purchasing let's look into the lower left quadrant which
portrays a fully extended global supply chain where fulfillment
takes place in the home country and delivery is also to a home
country location domestic order fulfillment and domestic
delivery an example of the scenario could be for purchasing
car seats from magna from the sorry and delivered at its plant
knowledge that you have gained in the previous two sessions we
at river rhones plant in michigan moving to the lower
right quadrant showing centralized state standard
global supply chain purchasing takes place in a foreign country
and delivered at home country location, that is global order
fulfillment and domestic delivery continuing the same
example, ford purchasing its axles from dona-talesol
uruguay and supply to its production base in flatrock,
michigan the top left quadrant shows the semi extended strategy
purchasing in the home country and delivery to your foreign
country location, which portrays domestic order fulfillment and
will now focus on the critical success factors for purchasing
global delivery an example of this combination could be ford,
purchasing car seats from magna based at its plant in missouri,
and dispatched to saint petersburg, russia the top
right quadrant illustrates the decouple strategy sourced in
foreign country and delivered to a foreign location where the
scenario is global order fulfillment and global delivery
in this scenario for purchasing its axles from dona-talesol
based in uruguay and sent to its factories site in saint
petersburg, russia, the sixth the success factor is related to
access to global suppliers the organization need to have access
in global supply chains we will highlight the research findings
, we are going to focus on session one, which will reach
in order to increase flexibility, and at the same
time, reduce variability and uncertainity of the customers
demand an efficient demand management requires insight and
understanding of the importance of demand forecasts and keen
observation of the market forces and how they impact on the
demand factors the fifth point is related to service
management service delivery management may be defined as the
process of making promises to the customers and keeping up
those promises this involves three small steps define a
customer order, create a network for delivery and deliver the
the impact of supply chain management practices on the
order an empowered service delivery system with effective
support system like facilities, infrastructure, etc, may render
the firm more competitive enough in the business the sixth
aspect is related to cash flow management one of the critical
challenges in the supply chain management is ensuring reliable
and predictable flow of funds with the partners in the chain
having an anonymous idea for the same the activities related to
cash flow for paying suppliers, internal transfer, invoicing
customers etc should be administered automation of the
payment process and monitoring the flow of cash using
performance of service businesses and you can easily
technology will facilitate better management the seventh
point is related to capacity and space management as the service
sector is labor intensive and deals with intangible output it
is highly essential to manage the capacity and skills of the
firm as for capacity, it is mentioned to the resources of
the firm that will be utilized to satisfy the customer desires,
needs and skills refers to the acquisition and retention of
qualified staff who can facilitate the process of
delivering value to the customers well, in this
session, we have covered the first learning objective of supply
explain the significance of service supply chain you can
chain management practices of service industry and i hope you
can ponder upon two questions which is put forth now for
further insights you can try to understand the business being
performed in case of ineffective cash flow management how can
the business be performed in case if there is any problem in
case of cash flow management and how the supply chain management
helps in the sustainable future of the service industry further,
in the upcoming session we will discuss on the other aspects of
supply chain management and service investing look
forward for the next session on service supply chains thank you
interpret and understand the challenges in service supply
chain in alignment with solutions to the business form
you can very easily design an effective servqual model for
business and we can analyze the effectiveness of supply chain
management in business , we are going to focus on session
one, which will reach the objective of understanding the
supply chain management in service industry most
the objective of understanding the supply chain management in
researches in the concept of supply chain management
pertained to the manufacturing industries in spite of its
prevalence in service industry the growth of the service sector
is to is so enormous since one thousand, nine hundred and seventy s that it contributes seventy-three percent to the
global economic output and about seventy percent of economic activity of many
developed nations companies in the service industry are trying
their best in increasing their efficiency, responsiveness and
flexibility in order to emerge as competitive with their
counterparts in the industry this can be made possible only
when they are confident enough about the goodness of their
service industry in this module on supply chain management and
operation strategy, methods and technologies involved in a
supply chain management, it is essential for the form statuses
and analyze the performance of the various practices involved
in the supply chain management it is highly difficult to define
or classify the service sector unlike the manufacturing sector
it may be essentially defined as everything except manufacturing
and farming business activities in relation to transportation,
communication, finance, insurance, real estate, public
administration travel, hospitality, wholesale and
retail trades may be categorized as services delivering value to
service sector, we have five learning objectives across
the customer is the main <fw/>mantra of service industry the
industry depends much on people's education and values
and ethics rather than goods and products the service sector is
the contributor of largest employment opportunities to
people of any country owing to globalization, the markets for
products and services have expanded each and every product
that has customers worldwide this makes the supply chain
management practices take center stage as the scenario has
increased the demands of the customers in terms of higher
quality services, lower prices, faster delivery, increased
acquaint knowledge on the supply chain management practices of
variety etc supply chain management in services industry
there are many proven studies on the importance of supply chain
management practices to any business as it creeps on the
objective maximization of overall value generated and
delivered to the end user further, supply chain management
is essential to reap benefits for the firm, such as cost
minimization, effective delivery, star rated performance
etc any company whether manufacturing or service
requires effective supply chain management practices as it
contributes lion's share towards the firm's performance and
service industry, understand the concept of service supply chain
growth while considering the service sector it is difficult
to set up a specific distribution channel as the
services are intangible and inseparable from the person
performing the same acm practices refers to a set of
activities undertaken by a company in order to facilitate
effective management of its supply chain and a sustainable
future for the business the figure projected shows two types
of objectives short term and long term objectives the supply chain
management practices in service sector are information flow
management let's see one by one the first one is
and know the specific issues related to service supply chain
information flow management information flow is considered
essential for integration in any strategy cullins by providing
the right information to the right person at the right time
information flow in the supply chain will serve data on various
aspects of the business like demand forecasting, defining the
scope of work ,skill required from the provider of the service
and also feedback on the performance the information
flow management is a practice that links all the people
involved in the supply chain with the data that is collected,
transmitted and utilized for the processing of information
and we are going to comprehend the service quality model and
required to complete all other management processes smoothly
the second one is related to customer relationship
management customer is the king of the business and the
satisfied customer is the success of any business crm is
a strategic approach that focuses on increasing the
shareholder value for the company through extending a
cordial relationship between the company, customer and customer
segments integration of crm in the supply chain was facilitate
and boost up the shareholder value of the firm and will
increase the performance of the business the third one is
we will look into a business case applying service quality
related to supplier relationship management modern supply chains
are so designed that the supplies have a direct impact on
the success or failure of the supply chain networks supplier
relationship management has become crucial because most of
the supply chains depend on outsourcing and srm refers to
the process in which customers and suppliers build a long term
relationship as partners the fourth point is related to
demand management, in the supply chain refers to the
efforts made towards establishing a balance between
customer requirements and the capabilities of the supply chain
model and we focus on the learning outcome of enumerating
supply_chain_management_10362
large number of branches situated
in different parts of the country in the world
this will give place to huge number of suppliers
for various products interlinked with the operations of the business
and the monitoring of such suppliers becomes tedious
in order to manage the suppliers and to reduce overhead costs
and avoid duplication of work that companies have to adopt
to centralization of purchase through technology
or e-procurement and also should follow a strict
service level agreements and make periodic reviews of the same
and they work towards the objective of achieving higher efficiency or responsiveness
coming to the simultaneous production and delivery
services are of nature that they are creation of time and consumption of time,
which are the same hence there is no return
or exchange of the service enjoyed for example, when a client goes to an it
service provider and uses the computer for surfing
he enjoys the service and in case he doesn't feel satisfied
about the frequency or speed of the connectivity,
he cannot argue with the service provider
this is an important consideration in the service supply chain management
with a about specific issues in the service supply chain
service supply chains usually involve the customer
today's session is closed further we will discuss about the service quality model
and a case study in the next session
here are a few questions to recap the sessions content
the first question may be how do you think outsourcing
helps better performance of service supply chains?
and you can try to differentiate the single level
and the two level bidirectional relationship
thank you
as a direct participant in the chain
unlike the physical goods supply chain
with reason developments of information technology,
the customers are involved in a direct faction,
and the new knowledge management strategies create
more opportunities to acquire a competitive advantage
it involves the customers, set strategies also pave
way for improvement in the quality of service,
welcome back this is the second session of
while trying to reduce the cost of providing the service
the figure attached shows a conceptual supply chain of service,
but the approach to and the relative importance of each component is different
we will focus
on the specific issues in service supply chain
as mentioned earlier, the supply chain of service vastly different
from that of the product supply chain
there are many reasons to it and few of which are deliberated now
customer supplier duality
the first issue is related to customer supplier duality
supply chain management in service industry
in services, the activities initiated by the customer
any service involves any act or deed
that involves a physical or mental inputs from the customer
or any information that is being provided by the customer
hence, the customer not only sticks as a customer,
but also as a supplier to the service
as the customer plays dual role this scenario is
called customer supplier duality in service supply chain
the customer supplier duality is called the bidirectional relationship
between customer and the service provider,
this session we will focus on the concept of service supply chain
which is depicted in the picture attached
the bidirectional relationship of the customer supplied duality may be of two types:
one is the single level the second one is the two level
the single level bidirectional relationship is
a condition where the customer
provides inputs to the service providers
the service providers handles the information, process it,
implements changes according to the inputs and converts them into output
in the service production process and delivers to the customers
the two level bidirectional relationship as it is depicted in the picture
and the specific challenges and the issues related to service supply chain
in this relationship the customer provides
inputs to the service provider
which is in turn provided to the suppliers
are the second level service providers
who assist in the process of converting the inputs into outputs
in the production process and deliver back to the customer
and it is explained to an example in the healthcare sector
packaged services few service providers offer
their services as a package the customer
a service package includes all the services offered by various service providers
the network of activities involved in a service delivery system,
this saves more time for the customers besides
providing them with convenience
package services are mostly found in tourism and hospitality
industry wherein the tour oprater has good linkages, airlines, restaurants,
transportation services and other services in order to provide the customers
with a wholesome experience of the tour or a holiday trip
outsourcing outsourcing has become one of the most
trending activity of services like banking, financial services, insurance
and telecommunication services
most of the companies have began to outsource
which are connected with the number of participants
their internal operations to focus on core competencies
the specialists firms which offers service outsourcing are referred to as
business process outsourcing, who are offered
the inhouse services of the companies
it and it enabled services firms are also
emerging as giants on whom the companies depend to
outsource their inhouse operations
outsourcing helps the business to focus on the core competencies
and on other hand it is more feasible for the companies
that have global presence to understand
who work in an unified direction for a successful delivery of
the local market and its demands when outsourced
further outsourcing will help to reduce the employee base
which within an organization, which in turn will help in reducing the operation cost
beside it will also provide enough access to additional skills and capacity
which will be an expensive process when it is done inhouse
we have an example attached
a north american company named allianz life insurance company has outsourced
various operations to a number of companies
and it is depicted in the picture given
which are all the company's allianz had outsourced
value to the customer is referred to as service supply chain
and for what operation they have
having a alliance with the other companies is given
managing suppliers in service supply chains
how are we going to manage the suppliers in the service supply chains?
enjoying a service is very less control
when compared to the purchasing of a product
the challenge in the service sector is the over billing in most service
contracts, differences in defining the service levels by vendors,
comparing purchase with the real worth of the service enjoyed etc
another challenge is managing the purchasing activities of
all the participants of the service supply chain are mutually related
supply_chain_management_10490
this helps them get the right feedback from the customer
to be utilized for improving the service quality
further they have a constant check on executive
log in volumes in a certain area,
zone-wise cancellation rates, demand supply match
in that area for both food and delivery executives
the picture attached explains
the scene behind this aspect
supply_chain_management_10499
the next one we are going to look into is responsiveness
and the customer satisfaction and it is more likely applicable
realizing the time sensitive nature of food,
and the intention to help the customers in line with their willingness
swiggy has made efforts to deliver the best on demand
consumer experience and hence,
they themselves are in the delivery business
the quality of food is inversely proportional to the time
it takes to deliver it and in turn when it is consumed
and this is when swiggy had introduced the live order tracking of the order status
the next dimension is related to empathy
unlike any regular e-commerce business
to the service sector rather than the manufacturing sector
swiggy is a three way marketplace in a hyperlocal setting
wherein there has to be a mass of consumers,
enough restaurants to be interlinked and the delivery executives at all times
this will aim to satisfy the needs of
each and every consumer and care for his needs
the app is so customized with personalized care as it shows
food preferences, the live snapshot of delivery executives
in customer's area, which restaurants are live, enough
variety that range across all price points and cuisines and more
swiggy makes it all possible with a big data
developed by the academic researchers zeithaml, parasuraman and berry,
and an impressive engineering team who work on real time accurate information,
amidst constantly changing dynamics
when a service firm focuses on the service quality and designs
an impressive service quality model
that allows the customers reap all the benefits of the service
the supply chain management proves to be highly effective
with an understanding of all the concepts related
to supply chain management and service industry,
we have now completed this module successfully
achieving the learning objectives
the servqual model pertains to market research concept
wish you good luck
as it studies the customer satisfaction
but the model can be very well linked to the service supply chain
as the ultimate goal of the supply chain is to deliver value to the customer
lets see the driving forces of the service quality model
as mentioned earlier, this model applies more to the service
organizations rather than the manufacturing organization
welcome back to session three of
the driving forces that influence the development of the model are
intangibility heterogeneity
of the services rendered by the value firm
these unique characteristics render it difficult
for the firm to assess the service quality objectively
hence, these two factors are considered important reasons
to assess the service quality of the firm
the model is also called as the gap model
as it helps the firm analyze the gap
between the service quality performance and actual service quality needs of the customer
supply chain management in service sector,
the model serves as a structure
approach to be utilized by the service firm straces service quality
the five dimensions of
the service quality model are tangibles,
reliability, assurance, responsiveness and empathy
tangibles is related to physical facilities infrastructure equipments
reliability: the ability of the firm to keep up the promises
dependably and accurately assurance is related to
the knowledge and courtesy of the employees and their ability
to build trust and confidence
wherein we will discuss about the service quality model
responsiveness is related to firm's willingness
to help the customer and provide prompt service
empathy is to care for the customers and provide individualized attention
so, these are all comprehensively
the five components of service quality model
the benefits of service quality model
the firms can improve their service quality by making
a thorough examination of the service needs and service quality
service quality provides detailed information on few aspects like:
how the customers perceive the service?
and analyze it with the help of a case study
how the customers perceive the performance?
how the employees perceive the customer satisfaction and expectation?
customers comments and suggestions?
this would help the firms make improve their service quality
there are certain limitations of this model
when this model is put to application,
there arises a doubt on the following issues:
the issues may be related to validity of the five dimensions
included, uniform applicability of the five dimensions to all the services,
use of different scores contributes to problem with reliability
this will bring about a better understanding of the significance
and now we will focus on a case
let's start with understanding the servqual model
by considering swiggy as an example
swiggy is a bangalore based food ordering and delivery company
it operates on a single window for ordering food
from a wide range of restaurants and not only that have own
an exclusive network of delivery personal who will
really carry out and pick up orders from restaurants and deliver it to customers
it is a complete food ordering and delivery solution
that connects neighborhood restaurants with urban foodies
that service quality has in the performance of the supply chain
the servqual model of swiggy is now explained
with the dimensions, tangibles delivering food is the core they do
hence it is a trio user line wherein the customers
restaurants and the delivery executives come in to see
being an app based business, the infrastructure facilities that
they require is it that connects consumers, restaurants
and the delivery executives
the executives delivered the food in a two wheeler
further there has to be a regional and zonal level personnel
who act as customer service executives to address
let's now start with the service quality model
any issues or challenges that arise
the next aspect is related to reliability
the promise and the predictability of the supply chain plays
a huge role in the consumers choice
no doubt that they encounter uncertainties in dish preparation times,
restaurants efficiency, delivery, executive's speed,
changing traffic conditions
and his familiarity with the area to name a few
if the consumer decides to order, his or her favorite dish,
but the delivery time is, for example sixty-two minutes
from the name of the model it is clear that it refers to service quality
they fail on a promise of timely delivery
if a consumer orders a particular dish,
but we then found that the restaurant is out of that dish,
we fail on this promise of availability
but besides all this, they are able to serve the consumers with
hunger savior in just a few minutes
the next point is related to assurance
right away in the app, there are options for the customers
to rate the food of the restaurant
and also the performance of the delivery executives
this module is essentially used to measure the service quality
music
most of the times, they have always provided
what you had asked for and the prices are nominal
music
and further,
music
they are not very
music
stuck on receiving payments immediately
music
music
and although you are regular and paying,
music
you have a periodic payment policy
music
and
music
this bakery is okay with it
music
you have an official meeting
music
inside the firm
with some foreign delegates
music
these delegates are very specific about what they eat
music
so,
music
you call this bakery
music
and place an order for
music
music
special items that you think these foreign delegates are going to have
because they have mentioned it to you
music
you asked for pre-packaged juice and a special kind of biscuits
music
you have ordered
music
for a group of thirty
music
now, this order
by breaking down
music
goes from the front office,
music
to the back office people who service this order
music
and
music
the back office people usually understand the orders
music
but on this particular day,
music
music
the usual boy who takes the order
music
he is on leave, he is sick
music
and somebody else has been filled in
music
instead of him
music
he totally misunderstoods the order
the walls of
music
and
music
instead of delivering
music
packaged juice
music
and the special biscuits,
music
he delivers tea and puffs
music
music
your guests and i learned that it chit of all
music
is in that a situation
music
let's consider the same bakery
music
let us see another scenario
music
let us assume
various silos
music
the new boy who is filling in,
music
hears the number as thirteen one three instead of thirty
music
and
music
he delivers
music
thirteen sets
music
music
of packaged drinks and biscuits to you
music
and
music
he is extra punctual
music
meaning, if the meeting is at ten o'clock
nine fifty-five sharp,
music
that have been formed over time
welcome to this module on
the thirteen sets of refreshment
music
greet you
music
all the delegates are sitting inside remember, there are thirty of them,
music
thirty
music
and you have received only thirteen sets
music
music
is that not an embarrassment now?
music
however i explain it,
music
what are your options?
music
well,
music
you can see how serious miscommunication can be
music
this module
or we could have another situation here
music
the bakery is
music
out of biscuits
music
, he places an order to the supplier,
music
supplier doesn't turn up
music
music
your meeting is at ten o'clock, he waits till 10:20
music
the guests are waiting, refreshment hasn't come
music
you are tensed up
you make calls and he says, "yeah, it's on the way"
music
and finally half an hour late,
music
he just delivers the chilled drinks,
tries to explain
music
no biscuits
music
what do you think you could do?
music
what will your delegates think about you?
music
don't you think it is the duty of the bakery
to inform you well in advance that he didn't have a biscuit
music
music
probably you could have made arrangements for
music
alternate snacks for them or you could have probably
told them that this is the situation
do let us know if you can adjust with something else
music
but
music
a wrong product reaching the place is definitely going to be an issue
music
this
is this not a serious situation?
music
all the cases mentioned till now,
music
are classic examples
music
of a lack of integration between different departments in a firm
music
of bakery is an extremely simple example
music
music
you can see that there is a barrier between
music
the person on the cash counter receiving the calls
music
and the person in the back office who is actually servicing your order
music
such a small
music
distance and a small miscommunication can cause
a huge embarrassment at the customer end
feature of integration
music
imagine its a huge firm,
music
five thousand employees,
music
fifteen departments
music
each department has their own priorities each one is occupied,
may get five hundred orders every day
music
music
every ten minutes there is a change in order
music
every single worker has to find out what the other person wants
its never given in a clear format
music
assume what happened if the bakery happens even in ten percent of these cases,
music
what do you think the result would be?
music
it will be
learning objectives
music
music
chaos
music
and
music
this is because there is no integration between different departments
music
by integration we mean different departments
should not draw boundary walls saying that,
music
music
that's your property and this is my property,
music
after all we all together are one single firm
boundaries have been wrong
for some working convenience
music
it doesn't mean there is a total division
where one person should not focus notion to the other
music
in fact, the entire principle of internal integration states that
explain the need for internal integration
music
both
music
the departments
music
and the customer need to be seamlessly integrated
music
this seamless integration
music
within a firm where
music
music
maybe the finance, the hr, the sourcing,
the it all of them have to break down barriers and think as one single unit
we have seen a supply chain maturity model
in the earlier modules
music
if you recollect,
music
supply chain maturity
music
in supply chains
was shown having five levels
music
level one -
music
was the ad hoc phase where there was
absolutely no integration, absolutely no integration
music
and then we saw level two and level three
music
where
music
music
the boundaries between departments within a firm were broken down
music
supply_chain_management_10912
music
the basic task
music
in that particular module was
music
to introduce the need for internal integration in the supply chain
two
music
unless the chain is internally integrated, meaning
you reach level two and level three
it's not going to be possible to have external integration,
music
which is represented by level four and level five
music
supply_chain_management_10927
music
much of the supply chain work that's going on today in the business world
music
is moving towards level two and level three
music
and for this to integrate all the functions
music
as especially in sharing of information,
music
you definitely need the software to do it
music
and gone are the days when you had a software for accounts
and had a software for manufacturing,
explain the role of an erp
you had a software for hr
and each one is written in a different language runs on a different system
music
all these are called the legacy systems
music
we need a fully integrated system
music
that can address the needs of the entire organization
music
and we are going to see that in the next video
music
music
in internal integration
manufacturing process integration
music
learning outcomes
music
at the end of the session,
music
the student must be able to
music
one
music
identify
music
music
points within a company
music
which cause
integration problems
music
two
music
identify
music
dear learners,
information needs at these points,
which an erp can provide to create integration
music
consider the following case:
music
you are a customer
music
of a bakery
music
that has been running in your neighborhood
music
music
for many years now
music
you regularly visit that bakery
music
and you have a working relationship
music
with the owner of the bakery
music
this bakery sells
before a supply chain is fully integrated,
music
the usual stuff that any bakery sells
music
cakes, pastries, buns,
music
coffee, tea, all other kinds of snacks
music
and
music
cold and hot beverages of all kinds
music
music
now in your office
music
for your meetings, you regularly place orders to this particular bakery
music
for the refreshments that you serve the guests
music
you have been very happy with the bakery because one it's nearby
music
and two
it is essential to first integrate
music
and that means
music
you have to have a safe place for keeping all that stock and make sure
music
that it is kept the way it is supposed to be kept
music
the biscuits are in proper order,
the juice is in proper order
music
usually they used to deliver all the products on time there was no complaint
remember you need a refrigerator for a cold drink
music
so you need to place it for two hours there
music
see how much of problem you need, just because you have ordered early
music
that's one issue
music
or
music
or the people
you can have another solution
every five minutes,the bakery owner can keep calling you and say
here is the status of this order,
here is the status, now it's ready, is going to ship
music
something like an amazon tracking
music
but all of us know,
music
that's a little foolish to do why? because you have other priorities
using the refreshments are not very finicky about what they eat
this is just a side delivery
music
for any business to ask the person to continuously
supply information about the status of delivery
can sometimes be overwhelming for the customer
music
or still
music
they can communicate well in advance when you place the order,
he could immediately verify his stock and say,
but under stress,
music
sorry sir, we do not have a stock of this,
music
do ask them but i have the following alternatives and each one is as good
music
that would give you a head start
music
and you can be confident
music
that
this lack of integration in any supply chain
music
your group of people who are coming for the meeting get precisely what they want
music
in all these cases,
music
what you have seen is the regular process has broken down
music
and the interdepartmental communication
music
has taken a big
can cause
music
beating
music
each person supposing the bakery on or goes and asked the delivery boy,
music
"why is it you didn't come and ask me?"
what do you think he is going to say? "i heard it that way"
music
iam here new how do you expect me to know?
music
music
and believe it or not in most modern organizations,
music
the same shifting of blame goes on why?
music
because
music
every department works in a silo
music
each department has their own norms
there is absolutely no commonality or
critical disasters
a common objective for all the departments together
music
what do you think this means?
music
lack of integration let us shift
music
to a big organization
music
let us say an organization making cars,
music
music
they have an engineering department,
music
they have
music
a machining department, they have an assembly,
music
they have a quality department,
music
they have a stores
music
you might end up supplying a totally wrong product to a totally wrong customer and
we have seen how the entire
can you imagine the kind of information flowing around?
music
the engineering department talks in a particular language
and makes a particular design
music
but when it comes to the machine shop,
music
they find that certain components
do not fit the specifications that the engineering is done
music
the brand name can take such a huge beating
they have to make their own adjustments to make the product
music
engineering would comply and saying that "you are not complying to my
standard operating procedure"
music
then it's not possible to do so at all
music
and the worst place in any manufacturing environment is the assembly
music
because
that will take many years to recover
music
once a good friend told me
music
that assembly is the graveyard or the dumping ground for the mistakes
music
of all the other departments in the factory,
music
meaning everybody makes a mistake and we get caught
music
why? because we have to clean up all their mistakes
music
music
if you go to the assembly line, you will find all sorts of discrepancies
music
and a huge level of frustration
music
supply_chain_management_11172
music
how do you get rid of this?
music
remember, you are going to have hundred product lines
for this entire integration process,
music
it's an extremely complex issue
music
and the only way, but i have personally seen
music
for getting rid of this situation is
music
get everybody on to the same discussion board,
music
have the problem discussed,
music
music
ask everybody to pitch in and come up with a collaborative solution
music
unless all the departments start
music
sitting together, talking to each other,
music
you are never going to be able to sort out
music
huge internal integration issues
the bakery example can definitely be extended to regular supply chains
music
and
music
this internal integration issue
music
requires a lot of information
music
whenever i have been to any workplace,
music
i have always found the biggest difficulty is in getting the right kind of information
music
music
most of the information happens to be opinions of people, they are not facts
and how do you think you are going to be able to get such facts?
for example,
music
when do you have a production issue? when do you have a rejection?
music
how many products had a problem last week?
music
how many workers are having an issue making all this
and
music
critical information, isn't it?
music
and how do you think you are going to get it? information, information, information!
music
this leads to information technology
music
not just any information technology, you need a complete system,
which circulates information
music
music
about the entire firm
music
to whichever department request it
music
and
music
this package
music
comes under the name of 'enterprise resource planning, or erp'
music
what do you think can be the biggest help
order delivery process in the bakery
there are plenty of such packages in the marketplace
music
the most popular ones happened to be
music
sap and
music
oracle
music
these are the two most popular erp packages
music
music
that could have any number of good open source packages as well
music
like
music
odoo
music
or
music
well you have tiny erp which was odoo in the beginning
music
towards internal integration in supply chains?
you have
music
open blue labs from ibm labs,
music
you have
music
any number of gnu packages
music
but remember being free packages, they are not having complete functionality
music
music
whatever the reason may be, erp goes a long way in
providing information
music
about the entire firm
music
it is called the transactional recording layer, it records all the transactions
music
isn't giving you information but you have the transaction records
music
erp is usually combined with some other packages,
this is a software solution,
music
like
music
crm,
music
customer relationship management,
music
or srm, supplier relationship management,
music
or advanced planning systems,it tries to optimize your plans
music
music
all these packages put together
music
serve to break down the barriers
between different departments,
music
so that
music
resources can be planned more efficiently
music
which is popularly called in today's
with the same final goal
music
namely,
music
"supplying the product or service to the customers
music
at the right time,
music
right place,
music
music
right cost
music
to his
music
full
satisfaction"
music
erp when properly implemented,
music
can lead to a beautiful,
language as
music
monolithic
music
behavior of the organization that works
like a music orchestra, everybody works to sync
music
and
music
in case you need details about a particular process
music
music
erp has it as well this feature is known as a drill down
music
it's lovely in concept,
music
but i have rarely seen a firm
music
which has a proper drill down
music
and a bulk of the firms which have invested a
lot of money in all these erp packages
enterprise resource planning,
music
music
are still in their learning curve
music
meaning they have not achieved the full,
music
full objective of why they started the whole process
music
they are learning and they have gone great steps
music
in using the erp package
music
music
to minimize their inventory or minimize their losses or whatever
music
but
music
they have not achieved the full objectives they set out to achieve
music
i have seen any number of these companies where
music
their original objective was of one hundred percent drill down for each process
erp let's go back to the bakery
music
well,
music
they have it up to the top management level,
but they can't go to the lower levels why?
music
because
music
they haven't featured or customized it yet
music
music
it's still a work in process
music
while enterprises resource planning software
music
is great to work with,
music
to actually use all the features available is a huge
music
distance away
music
how do you think
not too many firms have used it
music
and what does that mean?
music
they still have a long way to go in getting fully internally integrated
music
music
the problems could have been sorted out?
music
how do you think the problems could have been avoided in the first place?
music
do you think the bakery could have handled it differently?
breaks down
music
or on the other hand,
music
could you have handled it differently?
music
in each case, the final customer was the ultimate sufferer
music
and
music
its probably a loss of phase for you
music
music
the foreign guests are not likely to appreciate the fact
music
that the bakery made a careless mistake
music
this is going to cause a lot of strain
music
in your mind as an organizer
music
you have to spend a lot of time thinking about
under
what to do when some supply fails, instead of focusing
music
on the topic of discussion for the meeting
music
after all the meeting is far more important
music
than what refreshments you get
music
your entire time is wasted on making up and covering up the suppliers failures
music
music
this set of failures has happened because
music
your supplier was not internally integrated
now, consider a few solutions for the bakery
music
we will spend a little more time on the bakery because
its easy to extend what's going on to a regular firm
music
the processes are the same
music
specific conditions of stress
what do you think you could have done to avoid the situation?
music
one,
music
you could have place an order two hours in advance
music
why?
music
if something goes wrong, you have sufficient time
to plan for an alternative
music
matching supply chain with products modern supply chains handle two
play station might dig deep into your pockets you might be able
to buy fifteen other jeans for the price of an in fashion levi's,
but what is it that you would want the levi's and why? because
it's fashionable today all the other jeans might not have much
value for your ego we will call this emotional needs, it's not
want, it's to do with your esteem these products are like
passing fads, meaning once the season is over, you are likely
to get these products at throw away in prices, deep discounts they
are perfectly functional is absolutely nothing wrong
in the quality of the product and yet, they are given at throw
and responsive supply chains and match them with the right kind
away prices this doesn't happen of the previous category we
discussed, like soap, or rice now, these products have to be sold
in the season otherwise, when you can basically pick them up
off the road now and these products, the manufacturer makes
a huge profit margin why don't they visit any retailer and ask
him the kind of margins they make? the margins are huge but
if something is not sold, the entire thing is going to be a
loss for the manufacturer so here, speak to the market is
critical and the manufacturers have internal headache on
forecasting the demand for these products it's impossible to
of product consider the product like soap, shampoo or rice
ascertain and advance what the demand is going to be like, we
really don't know if it will sell in the market, or bomb in
the market take the play station for example they had asked for
a certain number of playstations based on their demand forecast
and it was such a huge success that they did not have adequate
play stations to give in the market see, they underestimated demand
there have been cases where demand has been overestimated
example, daewoo matiz, it used to belong to the korean
daewoo company now, gm has purchase it daewoo matiz was
launched in india as a fully loaded car they overestimated
how do you going buy such products?
demand, what do you think happened? the cars didnot sell such
products it's extremely difficult to estimate the demand,
and demand forecasting has to be a very carefully and
a continuously be done exercise we have considered distinct two
kinds of products the first kind of product has a low price
sells at a low margin, but the demand is steady it's very easy
to forecast it with a good deal of accuracy if something is not
sold at the end of the season, no big deal it will sell for the
same price next season,
no issues these are called
does the price for these products change at all? what
functional
products the second category of products
where
the prices are extremely high it's always in fashion the
profit margins are extremely large but once out of fashion,
they are going to be sold at rock bottom prices it's going to be
a total loss for the manufacturer so, speak to the
market, catching the fashion,proper demand forecasting are all
critical and it's an eternal headache forecasting the demand
something is not sold the season next season, forget about it,
about your demand for these products? do you consume more of
you're not going to be able to sell it such products are
called innovative products
them at some points and less of them at some other points is
your consumption based on some kind of fashion or trends
or is it based on
your day to day requirements?
do you get huge discounts at the end of the season or does it
distinct kinds of products functional and innovative both
sell for the same price all the time? now, the answer to all
these questions would be, come on! it is just a soap and a
shampoo i use the same amount irrespective of what the market
does it's my basic need and i hardly pay extra for the soap or
shampoo yeah, i get a discount, by getting a free soap it's
some other product once in a while, but the product itself is quite
a low value item i bet, if a soap is not sold, by the end of
the season, the shopkeeper is going to sell it to me in the
beginning of the next season for the same price he's not going to
reduce the price just because something did not sell in a
have distinct patterns on demand, pricing and certainty
season and all your soaps and shampoos do sell for higher
prices much of it is worth to sell at the same steady
price now, let's go to the side of the seller why don't you
visit a retailer and ask him the following questions ask him
what kind of margins he makes on the soap? do you think he makes
a margin of sixty percent and seventy percent margins? but i would want you to go and
check out with him directly what kind of margins he makes on such
products, namely the soap, the shampoo and rice ask him if
there is any particular demand season where the demand suddenly
goes up and suddenly comes down find out whether such products
they have to be handled with distinct supply chain
have huge cyclical variations in demand do you think these
products have a passing fad? meaning, you use them now and
then later on, we don't want them we're going to switch to
some other product when you eat rice today, probably a switch to
some other product you think it's going to happen? no,not at
all and do ask the seller what he does with the unsold stocks
let's say he has fifty kgs of rice, which he has not been able to
sell this particular season what do you think he's going to
do? is he going to dispose it of
at cost price saying,
configurations,namely efficient and responsive supply chains
take it at discounted price? or is he going to keep selling it to
you, irrespective of the season? whether you sold it or not? why
don't you want to ask him?
and finally,
do you think he's going to give you a discount just because it's
an older product? i think you should be asking the retailer on
all this all the products that we have mentioned are
usually the economy products,
the prices are never high i'm not implying that the prices are
rock bottom but these prices are never high they are not the
learning objectives, one, understand functional and
premium charging products these products are probably the
everyday use products,
you and i have, meaning we don't
care what the price is going to be so long as it's within our
own budget is a price band which is tolerable to all of us and
that's usually at the lower end of the spectrum these products,
we rarely compromise on the use, meaning that demand is always
steady as long as we get them at the proper price ranges, they
are not going to compromise on them we are not going to look
elsewhere we are going to change them we going to use them
innovative products two, characterize efficient and
the same now, these products, we usually buy them in bulk
meaning you need soap today in order to go and buy one bar of
soap you're probably going to buy a big case of soap if you're
going to use for quite a while, same goes for ways or even
shampoo we don't go and buy these products every day
meaning we try to get bulk discounts, we try to get package
offers, we try to do a lot of stuff where we can get a bulk of
the items for use over a certain period of time now, let us
consider a totally different category of products example,
a sony play station or the levi's jeans do you think they
responsive supply chains and match them with the right kind
are similar to the products we have just mentioned? absolutely
not then the sony play station is launched you have got
to get in then and there
if you miss the season, you're too old meaning you get an
absolete product the next play station is ready by them
and does it sell for the low price? well, i'm leaving it to
you to decide how many bars of soap can buy one sony
play station this is an example of a product where- one, the
prices are high and the margins are going to be high it's a
fashionable product which last for a particular period of time
of product learning outcomes one, identify functional and
it's something to do with your image not your regular ones
like a soap is for your regular ones, but the play station is not
for your regular ones the same goes for levi's jeans if
something is trending, let us say an acid washed jeans if you
miss buying it during the season, the next season acid
wash is out of fashion buying it has no value for you
absolutely no use now, these products are always sold at a
premium you never buy them in bulk now, in these products,
price is not an issue you are willing to pay any amount of
money to get these into your possession a levi's or a
innovative products in real life supply chains two, apply efficient
the last video, we considered two different kinds of products
has to be responsive , this whole process of matching the
right kind of product to the right kind of supply chain
configuration is known as supply chain fit
jeans or sony play station it doesn't matter at all whether
the rate is five hundred or one thousand or one thousand, five hundred rupees, what matters is it teaches you
on time
these two are totally distinct supply chains, isn't it?
these two distinct supply chain philosophies have two different
configurations they have been given specific names so that we
could probably have the right kind of supply chain or the
right kind of product consider supply chain configuration where
the cost of delivery of the product right from the topmost
player all the way down to the customer, is as low as it can
functional and innovative , from your understanding of these
get here, the time taken for moment as a product from the
first supplier to the last customer
is pretty steady
the volumes that move across the supply chain don't vary much,
maybe a little here and there but by and large, they are
steady it's extremely easy to predict the flow of materials
meaning you can see exactly how much of material can flow at
what particular point of time, when is it likely to go up a
little here little there by and large, you know what kind of
material was flowing across the supply
two kinds of products,
chain
here, there are hardly any information requirements
whatever information is required is so easy to predict that you
don't even want to ask for it there is not much of a flow of
materials backwards from the customer back to the supplier
whatever reaches a place, whatever be the condition it
doesn't go back, stays for this kind of supply chain
configuration is called an efficient supply chain the word
efficiency means, the input resources to the supply chain
have been minimized you use a minimum amount of resources to
do you think both the products should have
have the product or service delivered to the final customer
it's the cost these are extremely low cost supply chain
that's what makes them efficient in the first place the cost of
handling is so low that you can afford to charge low margins on
the products on the other hand, consider a supply chain
configuration whereanything that the customer orders for is
delivered within
twelve hours
you can make any changes in the delivery configuration within
half
similar supply chains? or should they be totally different? the
an hour this configuration will be addressed
the hange time less than twenty minutes
they always deliver on time
but usually comes at an extremely high cost here ,
supply chain cost is not an issue, absolutely not what
matters is how quickly and how quickly can the product be
delivered to the customer here, there is a lot of product
replacement going on, and plenty of movement of materials back
down from the lower side of the supply chain
to the upstream processes
objectives of both these equations have to be different
the supply chain has an extremely volatile customer
demand this demand has to be constantly updated and
constantly worked down most of the delivery that happens is so
unstructured that you can't be efficient half the time the
trucks don't get full you can't wait for a tractor get full to
deliver why? because the delivery is due you can't say no
my truck is half full can you wait a day, i'll deliver it a
day later that's not an option these supply chains focus on
very-very high value products so that these inefficiencies get
absorbed in the margins of the product , this configuration
one, delivers a product consistently here, it
of supply chain where the entire focus is on maximizing customer
service, while neglecting costs to a certain extent, nobody can
totally neglect the costs but here costs are not an issue as
important issue that is as serving the customer in time and
hiring high margins somehow absorbs these extra delivery
costs this kind of configuration is known as a
responsive supply chain , a responsive supply chain and an
efficient supply chain are two ends of the supply chain
continuum it's very difficult for a supply chain to be both
responsive and efficient there's hardly any in fact ,
doesn't matter whether the product is late by a day or the
responsive supply chains
obviously deal with a different category of products
when compared to an efficient supply chain considering what
you have done in the last video, can you guess which supply chain
should be used? or which kind of product? no marks for guessing
the answer it's a no brainer functional products, which are
low cost, steady demand lower margins obviously require and
efficient supply chain you can't have soaps being delivered
on demand supposing you do have a soap that's being delivered on
demand, it's going to be a premium so, meaning the product
product is earlybird what matters is what is the cost of
is no longer functional
and
be functional products have to be profitable only by means of
having an efficient supply chain innovative products on
the other hand, the margins are higher, obviously need a
responsive supply chain here,we observe the costs associated
with demand and certain
it is
with unsold stock with changing customer preferences all within
the extra margins that we charge here the supply chain
delivery to us whereas talking about a high end product like
dear learners,welcome to this module on business models outsourcing
what we saw till now
was an outsourcing complete verticals but should we be
outsourcing the entire vertical in one shot? would it not make
sense to keep certain critical portions of the vertical with us
and outsource only those parts which are either too irritating
to do or are beyond our competence, or can be done
better by someone else after all, nobody can be competent in
your line of business maybe in portions they could fit in your
entire business model an entire vertical it doesn't make sense
to outsource the whole thing, although a few firms are very
what is it? you are going to do?
very, very successfully
not everyone can be a walmart,
everyone can be a nike or a everyone can be an apple we are
going to have a shoe company which say outsources the
transportation, we could have a laptop manufacturing company
which outsources the development, but maintains their
own distribution centers, you could have a retail chain, which
probably specializes in making their own products and supplying
it , all these are examples of outsourcing using the product
architecture methodology in part architecture methodology
what are the dishes, you're going to have?
affirmed as all those activities where it is really good at this
is called core competence , if somebody has a core competence
in a certain level of skill, these skills are not outsourced
the companies zealously guards them because that is the source
of their competitive advantage , we have seen what is to be
outsourced you could follow the product architecture route or
entire vertical outsourcing route , we are moving to
another dimension of outsourcing how to decide
whether you should outsource yes or a no what do you think should
be the criteria for deciding whether you outsource or do
will you make sandwiches at home?
something yourself? well, we go back to the oldest secret in
business, namely, what is the cost? , supposing you decide
to make a product or service, what do you do? you need to have
a facility, you need to invest on people, you need to train
them, you need to get your equipment, you need to pay for
all your overhead, you need to pay a licensing costs and most
importantly, you need to manage your people somebody is on leave,
somebody has not done proper work it's a headache that you
need to manage, and what comes out the product or service ,
this is called, the agency cost where you need to run a system
or
to get an output because you own it on the other hand, supposing
you just decide to buy and sell are you three? no, no, you're
not why? because you need to identify a proper supplier, who
should give you a proper quality product, he should be
consistent, he should give it to you at the right price, he
should be able to consistently deliver and he should not
deliver the product to some other competitor of yours just
because he gives them ten percent more, meaning he should be loyal and
have a long term relationship with you , all these costs
associated with maintaining an external supplier are called
will you visit a hotel?
transaction costs common sense is this supposing your agency
costs are lower than your transaction costs i would make
but on the other hand, if my transaction cost is lower, than
the agency cost, i would outsource, simple ofcourse, there
are so many other variables which can override the cost
cancellation for example, supposing there is a sensitive
project like making of battle tanks, even though it's costlier
to make it yourself, for security reasons, i wouldn't
outsource it,
i would rather make it at a higher cost
or
in the same way, there are so
many other variables, but by and large, a business decision is
made
on cost
for a bulk of the supply chains out there, you can very well use
this simple equation to decide
when you're going to make or buy
the decision rule is is the cost of making less or is the cost of
buying less whichever is less, goahead with it if the passage
of time changes equation, we should be open minded enough to
would you rather order something on the latest apps like swiggy
be able to switch we shouldn't be stuck onto something just
because you like it
you know, but you're running a business
i'm giving you some work to do
list out the things at home, which you make yourself
and the list of things you normally buy
for the last five years, how many items have you switched
from making, to buying and from buying to making? why did
you make the shift from make to buy or buy to make? do list out
all the reasons because this is the beginning of your
and over how will you take a decision on which alternative you
understanding of
outsourcing
are going to choose? what are the priorities you will consider
to decide on one of the three options given or would you want
each firm has to decide on how, why and when to outsource here,
to have a combination of these options, meaning a little bit on
swiggy, a little bit made at home and maybe go to the hotel
for something else this example of your wanting to have dinner
is highly simplistic but don't underestimate the example this
is precisely what happens in usual supply chain supply chain
management is called the "big picture of a business" we don't
care too much about the details, but we are interested in what's
going on
overall
and our example
this topic is explained in a simple standardized approach
fits this particular scenario of factly very same decisions are
made in each and every supply chain and what are these
decisions? what are you going to outsource? when are you going to
outsource? how are you going to outsource? it could be a product or
service?
are you going to outsource
a portion of your process? or are you going to outsource an
entire process? how are you going to make that decision? and
also, in case you outsource, what kind of relationship do you
think you're going to maintain with your suppliers? all
learning objectives one explain the maker by decision two
suppliers want to have similar relationships? think about it
when we outsource, we can think about it in two different ways
one entire verticals, the other portions of the business
,
when we think of verticals, any business can be classified into
three major verticals verticals number one customer
relationship, vertical number two supply chain management,
and vertical number three product and vision and service
innovation ,the theory of outsourcing says, you could
outsource one or two of these verticals,
explain the strategic sourcing metrics learning outcomes at
the most
you cannot outsource all the three then you aren't in
business anyway, you become somebody else's business it's
great to be able to do all the three verticals yourself
but in case you're
cash strapped and you don't have the resources,
it always makes sense to outsource
one or two of the verticals consider nike if you go to the
factory where nike is being made, could be the shoes, could
be the jacket any of the products does it belong to
the end of this sessions the students should be able to, one
nike? not a chance somebody is doing it for them this nike
is packaged in this factory
and it is shipped with the stock points
does nike own the shipping, transport, not at all ,, what
are the stocking points? does nike own them? no, they don't?
from the stock point it goes to the retailer
does nike have its own retailers?
no the third party?
then what are the sign is nike doing? someone is making it, some
one is shipping it, someone is selling it, but nikes collecting
identify various avenues to outsource in a real life supply
the money what do you think they're doing? they are
designing the product the copyrights for the product stays
with them, meaning the outsourcer supply chain, they
outsource the customer relationship,
but they have kept the
product innovation and design
the same strategy is being followed by apple, could be their
iphone or their ipad its all
the same
, we could consider on the
chain two use appropriate strategies to outsource the
other sid, another example
walmart walmart specializes in supply chain they don't give too
much of importance to the other two they do have the customer
relationship and they also have a little bit of product
innovation but a bulk of the products are third party
products you do get an in house brand called the walmart brand,
but then in innovated some supplier does it and gives it to
them so, you can see that walmart has outsourced the
product, but they have kept the supply chain in look at
firms like amazon do they have anything, any shop? no, it's been
right kind of product let us assume you are hungry and you
outsourced what do they do? they have a huge focus on
customer relations everything else has been outsourced
although they do have some fulfillment centers where amazon
employees do work, a bulk of the supply chain has been
outsourced you can very clearly see that if you need to
outsource you could divide a business into the three
verticals and outsource one
or two of them, depending on
how good you are in the other vertical, which can make up for
outsourcing these two
want to eat something
till now we have been seeing
based comparing various suppliers, and have a proper
agreement so that you get all your products on time now, the
last quadrant, this is the strategic quadrant, the purchase
volume is very high thirty-five to forty %, thirty-five to forty percent purchasing, but the
number of components is just two to five percent what does it tell you
though, the number of components considered the low purchase value
is extremely high meaning if you're not careful here, this
can affect your bottom line, with time so you can see how this
particular analysis has a parallel to the abc
classification it's not bad, but it's similar here you can
classify your suppliers is the supplier grid, the supplier
see that high value is usually lower volumes and low value is
usually higher volumes for the comparison and there
matrix which you can see now on your screen now, this
particular matrix has two axis the horizontal axis talks about
the value of your purchase, and the vertical axis talks about
the supplier risk meaning how certain about the supply are you
is the supply like to be, likely to be disrupted if the supply
is disrupted, do you have an alternative if not, it is a
risky supply now, you can see that the horizontal axis is
divided into low value and high value the vertical axis is
divided into low suppliers, and high suppliers let us have a
what to outsource and how to outsource now, let us shift to
look like each of these quadrants separately each of
these quadrants is a totally different kind of supplier and
requires a different kind of strategy the first quadrant
we're going to consider is low purchase value, and low supply
risk now, these people are not very important to your business
because you're not buying too much from
them anyway
and also, they are very loyal to you, meaning they depend on you
so, you really don't need to bother much about them just go
ahead and subcontract in the usual way you don't need to
another topic and outsourcing let us say you're outsourcing an
spend too much
time on it
in case the supplier doesn't do well, you always have
alternatives and he is not likely to miss out on supplies
because he depends on us okay, so these people, we use
something called routine products to classify them these
products are formed routine products, and any general systems
of contracting should do here, the supply risk is still low,
but we're purchasing a large value of our outsource products
from the suppliers now, that means you have to be a little
item to supplier a now, are you going to treat all your
more careful, you can just subcontract it these goods are
called leverage goods now, since we buy a large amount of
goods from a single supplier, he depends on us he probably
cannot find another customer who is willing to give him such a
large business you could definitely ask him for a big
discount, he is going to upload so, what we do here is
competitive bidding get three four people to bid so you can
get the lowest price remember, he depends on us let's move to
the third quadrant the third quadrant is low purchase value,
but high suppliers we don't buy much from the supplier but they
suppliers the same? or do you have a differentiated strategy?
are not the reliable let's take an example when there was a huge
tsunami in japan,
a very small component was supplied by fujitsu to companies
like toyota, and mitsubishi and this was just a chip, which is
used in the engine to ignite the diesel engines and the petrol
engines, we don't have carburetors anymore, you know,
this is multi-point fuel injection, and the chip factory
was destroyed and what happened? toyota had to stop
production for two weeks they got alternate supply from
somewhere else and the value of the chip is very small but if
how do you think a supplier can be rated? we do have a vendor
it's not reliable, operations can take a hit now, these products
are called leverage products where we depend on the supplier
but the value is not much he doesn't depend on us because
he's probably supplying one hundred other people so here, what you
need to do is have a proper performance based contract
meaning you need to put in a lot of effort, need to do a lot of
reviews, even though the purchase volume is very low finally, we
move to the last quadrant, this quadrant is a very dicey
quadrant we have huge purchase volumes on one hand and on the
other hand,
rating process but no, this is different remember this is
supply risk is also very high so that
means something goes wrong here the entire business can take beating so,
these are basically collaborative supply chains you
need to sit and talk to these people, you need to put in a lot
of your effort you need to exchange resources, you need to
regularly talk about how to improve performance and all of
that this grid was analyzed by a good friend professor janat
shah
he discovered the following
answer the question quadrant one routing products now as the
supply chain in supply chain, we need to have a proper strategy
bulk of the indian firms the purchase volume was between fifteen
and twenty percent and the percentage of parts, the number that was eighty
to eighty-five percent and a large amount of this routine, what does this tell
you, you could very well outsource eighty percent of your products
in a routine way without bothering about, are you going to
have an issue wether he is critical to you he is not
if you go to the next quadrant,
where the volumes are a little higher the one to the right
they found that the purchase volume was between thirty-five percent and forty percent
of value and the percentage of the components that means the
on how to deal with different categories of suppliers? and one of
number of components having this kind of a characteristic
was between two and five percent meaning you could count the number of
parts which you really need to leverage from your supplier of
bulk or general but this is special as we go on to the third
one, the bottleneck one meaning the value is lower, but the
supplier risk is higher, they found that the purchase volume
was between five and eight percent and the percentage of the parts was the
number that is was between ten and fifteen percent that means ten to fifteen percent of
the products are likely to cause a headache, you have to be very
careful and look for our alternates our total performance
the easiest methods that clearly tells you a strategy on how to
hello viewers, i'm dr b sudhakar director, department of mba
a facility that focuses on the development and process
technologies, creating new products, processes and
technologies for the entire network is known
as the lead facility next, we look at the technological
factors, new technologies have been emerging this has resulted
in a few high capacity production locations with
economies of scale if these facilities have lower fixed
costs, then many facilities like the one planned and established
to get the cost advantage to serve the market are done but
if the fixed costs of setting up these facilities is high, it is
cost of the supply chain as well as satisfy the service level
advisable to set up few facility locations which may serve the
market the impact of macro economic factors come next
tariffs and tax incentives are important factors under this
duties which have to be paid by a company when the products
produced by them are moved to the market across the city,
state or borders known as tariffs when the tariff is low
in a country, the company sets up the facility to manufacture
the products to sell the markets across the borders but if the
tariff is high in a country companies set up manufacturing
plants within the country to serve the local market to save
requirements of each and every member in the supply chain to
on duties countries encourage firms to set up the
manufacturing facility in specific areas by providing an
incentive to them by the way of reduced taxes and lower tariffs
they expect those companies to focus on production for
exporting the products similarly, exchange rate and
demand risk have an influence on the location decision supply
chains that serve the global market are affected by the
fluctuation in exchange rates this has a significant impact on
the profits of the supply chain similarly, when there is an
economic slowdown in the global market, it has an impact of
meet the expectation of the customer the learning
indian industries the demand for the product reduces
companies which are highly flexible to the demand, adjust
the manufacturing facility to manage the situation when the
demand increases, flexible companies meet the demand with
extra capacities they can create the next factor is
political factor members of the supply chain prefer to locate
their facilities in a country where it is investment
friendly and have a well defined system for commerce and
industry they also expect the policies of the government to be
simple and clear, with faster process of approving for setting
objectives of this module are- to discuss the role of facility
up the location facility next comes the infrastructure
factors, availability of land with other factors of production
like labor trust facility skilled manpower, and local
government support are important infrastructure factors affecting
the facility network design decision, one has to consider
these factors and decide on locating a facility in that
place competitive factors play an important role in identifying
the best possible location, competitive strategy, their
size, and location are to be considered when designing the
supply chain networks when colocation of the facility with
decisions in a supply chain, to understand the factors
the competitor benefits the company, they locate themselves
closer and get the benefit next factor is the customer response
time when customers can wait for a longer response time, the
company can plan to have a few facility locations and can
increase the capacity of location whereas when a customer
wants a faster response time, the companies have increased the
required number of facilities in the network to satisfy the
customer requirement, this results in increasing inventory
costs in this edition, we have discussed the importance of
facilities decision in a supply chain and the factors affecting
influencing network positions in a supply chain, to discuss the
the facility network decision in the next edition, we will
discuss the impact of the network decision on supply chain
costs and the framework for the facility decision network
position for a supply chain thank you
framework for network design decisions in the supply chain, to
discuss the various methods of location planning in a supply
chain the learning outcomes would be an understanding of the
role of facility decisions in a supply chain and understanding
in hindustan college of arts and science converter today the
of the factors influencing the network decisions in a supply
chain and understanding of the framework for network design
decisions in a supply chain and to understand the different
methods of location planning let us first understand the role
of facility decision in supply chain supply chain facility
decision deals with the process of identifying the location of
manufacturing, storage and transport related facilities of
the supply chain and the allocation of the capacity of
various members with their roles in the supply chain it is also
known as the supply chain network design decision the
topic of discussion is facility decisions and location planning
network design affects all the members of the supply chain as
well as the role of each facility the decision is highly
significant, as it determines the flexibility of the supply
chain in the current dynamic market condition the facility
location decision is capital intensive, which will impact the
supply chain performance
a good facility decision will always
help the supply chain to be responsive,
as well as be cost effective capacity allocation decisions to
each facility of the supply chain will have a significant
in a supply chain
impact of its performance when we allocate too much capacity to
a particular location in our supply chain, it may result in
under utilization of the facilities, which may result in
higher cost similarly, when we allocate too little capacity to
a particular location, it may result in poor responsiveness of
the facility of the supply chain and it may increase the cost of
logistics from this, we can understand that allocation of
supply sources and markets to facilities have a significant
impact on the supply chain performance in meeting the
customer demand hence, the facility decision in a supply
introduction to supply chain
chain will have a significant impact on its performance as
they determine the supply chain configuration and the
constraints in which the inventory transportation and
information can be used effectively in decrease the
supply chain cost as well as increase the responsiveness of
the supply chain let us now look into the factors which
influence the facility network design decision network design
decision plays a significant role in determining the
distribution network for moving products from the supplier point
to the customer point in the supply chain it is the key
supply chain management is the set of activities involved in
driver of the overall profitability of a firm in the
supply chain because it affects both the supply chain cost and
the customer experience directly designing an appropriate
distribution network will help us to achieve the supply chain
objectives that is lower supply chain cost and high
responsiveness strategic technological, infrastructural,
competitive, macro economical, political, logistical and
operational factors influence the network design decision of
the facilities in the supply chain , let us discuss each
factor independently, it has start with the strategic
the process of efficiently integrating the suppliers,
factors a firm's competitive strategy has a significant
impact on the facility network design decision in the supply
chain a company which focuses on the cost leadership can plan
to find the lowest cost location for creating the manufacturing
facility, even if the location is far away from the markets
they are serving similarly, a company which focuses on risk
responsiveness to demand can plan to locate the facility
closer to the market and can select a high cost location,
which may allow them to react quickly to the changing market
needs the facilities can be classified based on the possible
manufacturers, warehouses and stores supply chain distributes
strategic roles, they play in a supply chain and offshore
facility, which tends to be the low cost production facility for
export production serves the role of being a low cost supply
source for markets which are located outside the country a
facility where the cost of production is low for the global
market, place as the source facility for the global network
this facility has the advantage of lowest production cost with
the required infrastructure and skilled manpower a
facility is created in a particular place of a region
where it gets the benefit of tax incentives, tax benefits and
the products manufactured at the right quantities to the right
local content requirement is known as a server facility of
the region and supplies to the market tariff barriers and
logistic cost to supply the region from elsewhere will be
high, and hence the facilities serves the requirement of the
region contributer facility is a regional production facility,
which focuses on product customization, process
improvements, product modification and development to
serve the market of that region and outpost facility is a
regional production facility, which uses the local skills that
may exist within the region to satisfy the market requirements
locations and at the right time in order to minimize the total
in the last edition, we have discussed the importance of
cost and the framework of the facility design network decision
for supply chain in the next edition, we will discuss the
analytical methods in evaluating the locations for facility
decisions for a supply chain thank you
when the number of facilities planned is increased, the
inventory cost also increases therefore, the companies should
analyze the requirement of inventory, location of facility,
requirement of transport facility and the facility costs
while designing the facility network for the supply chain
the transportation cost also has an impact, the cost of sending
material per unit tends to be higher than the costs of
bringing material into the facility because incoming lot
sizes are always larger than the outgoing large sizes at one
point of time when we increase the number of warehouse
facilities decision in a supply chain and the factors
locations at different places, which are closer to the market,
it decreases the average distance to the customer and
makes the outbound transportation distance lesser
when compared to the total distance traveled by the
product this results in reduced transportation costs when the
company plans and achieves the economies of scale key in
inbound transportation, it is advisable to increase the number
of facilities which decreases the total transportation costs
we also have to understand that the inbound lot sizes decrease,
increasing the number of facilities will increase the
affecting facility network decision
total transportation costs
facility cost
facility cost is directly proportionate to the number of
facilities created
therefore, the companies in the supply chain has to determine
the optimum number of facilities required to meet the requirement
that minimizes the total logistics cost if a company has
the objective of reducing the response time to its customers,
then it may plan to establish more number of facilities beyond
the optimum number of facilities
in this edition, we will discuss the impact of the network design
required this decision
can be implemented only if the supply chain manager is
confident that this decision will increase the revenue of the
supply chain , let us look into the framework for facility
network design decision the process of deciding the facility
network design decisions can be divided into four phases phase
one focuses on the supply chain strategy towards facility
decision phase two focuses on the analysis of the factors of
regional facility and its configuration phase three
focuses on identifying the desirable sites for the
decision on supply chain cost and the framework for the
facility and phase four focuses on designing the location
choices for the facility one which is the process of
designing a supply chain strategy in this phase, a clear
understanding of the company's competitive strategy to meet the
customer requires of the supply chain is needed the supply
chain managers then forecast the global competition and
determines the competition in each market, whether it is
global or local, they should also have an understanding of
the constraints
on the availability of capital
facility design network decision for supply chain the
this will help them to determine whether the growth can be
accomplished by acquiring existing facilities or to build
new facility or partner with someone to satisfy the customer
requirements once they determine this, the supply chain
manager formulates his strategy to design the facility location
decision
phase two
comprises of defining the regional facility configuration
in this phase, the supply chain manager has to forecast the
demand by country which will include a measure of the size of
distribution network design effects the following supply
the demand and the requirement of the customers across
different countries this will help them to identify whether
the customer needs a homogeneous or heterogeneous if the needs
are homogeneous, it is suggested having large number of
consolidated facilities but if the needs are heterogeneous,
then which vary across countries, it is suggested
having smaller localized facilities supply chain
managers should analyze the various factors for local
production, economies of scale and decide the need to locate
the facility closer to or far from the competitors facility
chain costs, logistics cost and facility cost logistic cost and
phase three which is the process of selecting a set of
desirable potential sites this phase focuses on silver
selecting the set of desirable sites
for the facility to be located
within the region the selection of potential site depends on
various factors like infrastructure availability,
availability of suppliers, transportation services,
communication facility, utilities, warehouse facility,
availability of skilled workforce, workforce turnover,
and community receptivity to business and industry to support
facility costs depends on the number of facilities planned
supply chain requirements based on these factors, the potential
sites have to be selected phase four where we decide the choice
of locations in this phase the objective is to select the best
possible location from the selected potential sites the
capacity of each facility selected will also be determined
the location is selected based on the various costs namely
logistics cost, facility cost, taxes, tariffs, and the expected
profit it could earn which will maximize the total profits of
the supply chain in this edition, we have discussed the
impact of the network design decision on the supply chain
their location and the capacity needed for the supply chain
in the last edition, we have discussed the impact of the
same regardless of the location where the goods are produced,
then the total revenues can be eliminated from consideration,
and the potential locations can be compared on the basis of
their total costs by using breakeven analysis, we can find
a location that has the lowest total cost for a given volume
range
the following steps
are to be followed in using breakeven analysis for the
facility location decisions
for each location, we have to determine its fixed
which is known as
costs and variable cost per unit on a graph, we have to
plot the total costs for each location against a range of
annual production volume the objective is to find out the
location which has the lowest total cost or specific volumes
of production to find out this, we use the breakpoints are the
total cost curves the total cost curves of all location will
intersect each other the intersection of the total cost
curves of various locations are known as the breakpoints from
this, we have to identify the lowest cost curve which is
formed by the cost curves of various locations , drop a
gis let us discuss
perpendicular line from the break points of each lowest cost
curve this will give us a range of volumes for which various
locations will be suitable let us consider an example, four
different locations a b, c and d are considered for the facility
location decision the fixed costs and variable costs are
given let us assume that the quantity demanded as ten thousand
units using this quantity, we have to calculate the total cost
for each location as given below location a, the total cost is
three sixty thousand , location b, the total cost is
four hundred thousand , location c total cost is three hundred and fifty thousand ,
one by one the factor rating method
location d total cost is five hundred and fifty thousand for producing ten thousand
units using the about data, we draw the graph the graph drawn
is given for your kind reference,
we can visualize the intersection
of the total cost curves which is known as the breakpoints and
is denoted by
p one ,p two
p three and p four p one is the intersection of the total cost
curve of location a and location d p two is the intersection of
the total cost curve or location v and location c p three is the
in this method, the area's location alternatives are
intersection of the total cost curve of location a and location
b, p four is the intersection of the total cost curve of location
a and location c from this, we can analyze that the lowest
total cost curve is formed with the help of the total cost
curves of location b from the initial stage of quantity till
they break point p two say, zero to five thousand units from this
breakpoint p two to p four for the lowest cost curve is formed with
the cost curve of location c say from five thousand units to eleven thousand units
and from the break point p four the lowest cost
curve is formed by the cost curve of location a ,say eleven thousand
evaluated by rating the relevant factors the
units to sixteen thousand units , this analysis helps us to find which
location is suitable for different quantities to be
having or move across the supply chain as mentioned in the
graph the center of gravity method the center of gravity
method is a mathematical technique, which is used to
identify the best possible location for facility decisions
it identifies the location, which is equidistant from all
the members of the supply chain, so that the supply chain cost is
minimized supply chain costs will depend on several factors
such as the weight of the product, the quantity to be
steps involved in this method are
supplied, the distance to be traveled, and the speed at which
it must travel
to satisfy the requirement of the customer
this method assumes that there is a linear relationship between
the distribution cost and the distance and quantity shipped
this method
makes use of a map with the coordinate systems to identify
the coordinates of a central location, relative to all other
location which will be cost effective the geographical
information system the geographical information system
step one determine the list of most relevant factors needed in
is an important tool, which is used to analyze the location
decision or manufacturing our service industries it is a
computerized system which can store, relate and display the
data collected from a particular geographical location
geographic information system maintains the databases of
geographical information of all places in the global
environment which helps to analyze the various factors of
locating a facility decision and such as the best possible
location retailers use this geographical information system
to identify the best possible location to serve the customers
the location step two determine the rating of each
in this edition we we have discussed the different
analytical methods available in evaluating the location decision
for designing the facility decision of a supply chain
factor on a scale of one to five based on its importance,
where one being low and five being high step three rate
network decision on the supply chain cost and the framework for
each location on a scale of one to ten for each factor,
where one being low and ten being high
then, step four
calculate the rated points for each location by multiplying the
factor rating and the location rating, which has been gotten
step two and step three respectively
step five
calculate the total score for each location by summing up the
scores calculated in the previous step
step six
the facility design a pub decision for a supply chain in
select the site that has the maximum number of scores total
scores
this is the process
involved in identifying the best possible location using the
factor rating method the next method is the breakeven
analysis,
cost volume profit analysis
our breakeven analysis helps us to understand the relationship
between total cost and total revenue of particular location
based on the total cost and total revenue, we can calculate
this edition, we will discuss the analytical methods in
the point from which profits generate for a particular
location when comparing several potential locations, we can
calculate the profit of all locations and choose the best
location which earns more profit at an earlier stage onward the
following steps are to be followed in using breakeven
analysis for the location decision
for each location, we have to
determine the fixed cost and variable cost per
unit
on a graph, we have to plot the total cost
evaluating the locations for facility decisions of a supply
for each location against a particular
quantity of volume
then, determine the revenue for the capacity plant the
objective is to find out the breakeven point of various
locations to make the facility planning decision the total
cost curves of all location will intersect the revenue curve to
keep the volume of breakeven for each location from this, we have
to identify the best possible location
for a quantity plan
let us consider an example
chain the analytical methods for evaluating the locations are
four different locations a, b, c, and d considered for the
facility location decision the fixed
costs and the variable costs
and the revenue per unit are given below
let us assume that the quantity demanded is ten thousand units if the
price per unit is rupees seventy we can calculate the total revenue
for this quantity using the quantity we have to calculate
the total cost for each location and the total revenue as given
below location a fixed cost is two hundred and fifty thousand , variable cost
per unit is leveled, quantity demanded is ten thousand total
given below decision making tools can be used to select the
variable cost is one hundred and ten thousand the total cost is one hundred and sixty thousand
and the total revenue earned is seven hundred thousand
similarly, for location b, the fixed cost is one hundred thousand , variable
cost per unit is thirty ,quantity is ten thousand units, total variable
cost is three hundred thousand the total cost is four hundred thousand and the total
revenue remains same as seven hundred thousand location c , the fixed
cost is one hundred and fifty thousand variable cost per unit is twenty quantity is
ten thousand the total variable cost is two hundred thousand the total cost is
three hundred and fifty thousand and the revenue stands at seven hundred thousand
location d, the fixed cost is two hundred thousand variable cost per unit
best possible location the most popular and commonly used ones
is thirty-five the quantity demanded is ten thousand , the total variable
cost is three hundred and fifty thousand and the total cost is five hundred and fifty thousand
and the total revenue earned is seven hundred thousand
by calculating this,
we will be able to determine the break even point
using the about data, let us draw the graph let us have
quantity in x axis and the cost in y axis in x axis one unit is
equal into thousands of units in y axis one unit is equal into
thousands of rupees the graph drawn is given for your current
reference we can visualize the intersection of the total cost
are factor rating method, breakeven analysis, center of
curves with the total revenue curve, which is known as the
breakeven point and it is denoted by p one p two p three
and p four p one is the breakeven point for location b
p two is the breakeven point for location c p three is the
breakeven point for location a and p four is the breakeven
point for location d
from this,
we can analyze the breakeven quantity for various locations
which will help us in making the facility location decision using
the same method, if we assume that the revenue per unit is the
gravity method and geographical information system
supply_chain_management_12468
the transportation cost per unit decreases
this is also known as the tapering principle in transportation
these two principles are used during the evaluation process of various
transport alternatives in a supply chain
the goal of the supply chain manager is to maximize the size of the load to be shipped
and the distance to be shipped at the lowest cost
to meet the expectation of the customer in terms of their service expectations
let us now look into the participants of the transportation process
the participants are the shipper or the consignor,
the consignee, the carriers and agents,
to the right locations and at the right time
the government, internet and the public
let us now look one by one
shipper or the consigner: the organisation or the person
who wants to transport the goods from one place to the another place
is known as the shipper or consignor
consignee:the party who receives the product through transportation
at the destination is known as the consignee
carrier or agents: carrier is an organization
who is into the business of moving the goods from one place to another
carriers coordinate the pick
in order to minimize the total cost of the supply chain
and delivery of products to the customers point in addition to the movement of goods
brokers and agents are intermediaries
who act as agents for the carrier
to facilitate capacity and shipping requirements
to the carriers government:
government plays a major role in transportation
it takes the responsibility of creating the transport
infrastructure across the country
to enable the economy to grow sometimes they are also involved in
the transportation of goods
as well as satisfy the service level requirements
they frame the regulations on the movement of goods
and govern the process of transportation across the country
internet: the recent development in
information technology and communication technologies,
the transport industry has been able to widen
their scope of business and services across the globe
capacity matching and shipment requirements are managed online
through internet resulting in more and effective businesses
information sharing across the members of the supply chain
regarding the transportation through the network has helped
of each and every member in the supply chain
the members of the supply chain to increase their performance
similarly, the real time visibility of the movement of goods
has helped the scheduling and capacity planning of the members
across the supply chain public:
public plays a vital role in determining the growth of the transportation system
the public create the demand for the products
which is translated across the supply chain
resulting in transportation of goods across the supply chain
in this process, the public expect the industry to do the process
keeping in mind and environment and safety standards,
to meet the expectations of the customer
so that they do not affect the society
they also expect the cost of transportation to be minimum
as they will get the benefit while purchasing in this edition,
we have discussed the role of transportation
and the principles of transportation in a supply chain
in the next edition, we will discuss the different modes of transportation
and the transport economies in a supply chain

introduction of transportation:"moving of goods from the point of origin
to the point of destination across the supply chain
through its members is known as transportation "
it is an important driver for the supply chain
because the goods produced are rarely consumed in the same location
role of transportation in supply chain management
the role of transportation in logistics has changed with a wide variety of
presenting you this module on 'transportation
transport alternatives and with a wide range of
value added service to support the supply chain
private transport companies have become part of the supply chain
and third party logistics companies
offer a wide variety of services like product sorting, sequencing,
and customized freight delivery to improve the efficiency of the supply chain
advancement in technology has improved
the services of the logistics with real time visibility of
tracking the vehicles using gprs systems
and the integration of delivery systems through internet
and warehousing decisions in a supply chain'
development of an integrated transport management system
has improved the product delivery
and reduce the inventory and material handling,
resulting in reduced transportation costs
and improved value of transportation for the supply chain
let us now discuss the transport functionality
transportation is the backbone of an economy
improved transportation infrastructure helps the economy to grow
transportation is an important element of logistics
it helps the supply chain in the movement of products and storage of goods
introduction to supply chain
movement of products from the suppliers
to the customers across the supply chain
has become the primary value proposition of transportation in a supply chain
its performance is based on the time, cost
and the impact on the environment
today, the developments in information technology
have significantly improved the access to data on the movement of the transport
and the time of delivery, which helps the supply chain
to plan the exact time of delivery to the customers
on an average, the transportation cost is about thirty percent of the total logistics cost
supply chain management is the set of activities
we understand that transportation is a non value adding activity,
hence,the focus of the supply chain
is to reduce the cost of transportation to decrease the total supply chain cost
transportation industry is the largest consumer of fuel
and oil across the globe
efforts have been on to bring in fuel efficient vehicles
which are environment friendly
as they affect the environment through air pollution and noise pollution
storage of products during transportation
is considered as an option when there is a total cost advantage
involved in the process of efficiently integrating the suppliers,
to the supply chain and or when it improves the supply chain responsiveness
it may be also considered as the best option
when there is diversion of products during the transit
supply chain managers use transportation
to improve their responsiveness and and their overall performance
transportation principles
transportation principles are two one the economy of scale
and second the economy of distance
economy of scale is in transportation is referred to the reduction in cost
per unit of weight transported in relation
manufacturers, warehouses and stores
to the increase in lot size of shipment done
for example, when a truck full load
shipment utilizes the entire capacity of the truck,
the cost per unit of load transport, transported gets reduced
but when we utilize only part of the entire capacity of the truck,
the cost per unit of load transported gets increased
economy of distance in transportation
is referred to the reduction in transportation cost per unit of weight
in relation to the distance mode for that quantity of shipment
when the distance mode increases for a given volume of goods,
supply chain distributes the products, manufactured at the right quantities
supply_chain_management_12626
for small, high-value items are time sensitive
emergency shipments that have to travel a long distance in shorter time
it is mostly used by the members of the supply chain
who have shorter lead times or advanced service levels
and speedy delivery of goods
air carriers move products that have high value but are light in weight
limitations of air transport:
air transport is relatively an expensive mode of transportation
it is not suitable for transporting heavy
and bulky goods as well as for short distance travel
for a sound transportation system
pipeline transport: pipeline transport is a specific mode of transportation
for moving products which are in the form of gas, liquid or slurry
the characteristics of pipeline transport:
pipeline operates twenty-four x seven and three hundred and sixty-five days
and move products such as crude petroleum, refined petroleum products and natural gas
the initial investment in creating the pipeline
and the needed infrastructure is high
pipelines are fixed and are not flexible
they can be used for certain commodities only
and cannot be used to move variety of products
let us discuss the merits and
the characteristics of transportation modes:
the various modes of transport can be compared
on the characteristics of their speed, frequency,
dependability, load they can carry and the service locations
which they can serve the ranking of the various modes of
these factors are given below
in the table intermodal transportation:
intermodal transportation is the use of
more than one mode of transport for the movement of shipment
from the point of origin to the point of destination
limitations of each mode of transportation
it uses two or more modes of transportation
to take the advantage of inherent economies use of each
and thus provide the integrated service at lower cost
the most widely used intermodal systems
are the trailer on flat car tofc
and the container on a flat car cofc
package carrier is a form intermodal transportation
provider who uses air, truck
and rail to transport the goods
they also provide other value added service
road transport: roadways is the widely used
that allows shippers to get benefitted
transportation economies and pricing:
transportation managers are responsible for determining
the effective and efficient transport mode
to satisfy the requirement of the supply chain members
to improve their efficiency
transportation economies and pricing
depend on certain factors which the transport manager should be aware of
the transport economies and the pricing depends upon
your economic drivers, costing,
transport mode across the supply chain in any country
carrier pricing, transportation rates and ratings
the economic drivers are driven by the factors like distance
to be traveled, weight to be taken for the travel,
density of the products, stowability of the product,
handling of the product, liability and the market conditions for the product
transportation costing can be classified into
fixed cost, variable cost, joint cost and common cost
carrier pricing strategy depends on cost of service and the value of service
transportation rates depend on the region
and the commodity to be transported
trucks are used to transport materials
the selection procedure for the transport mode
could vary from the simple decision
either by identifying one feasible method of distribution
or a choice of methods to distribute the products
the transport manager identifies
the best mode from among the choice of alternates available
based on the economic and the pricing factors
to conclude, we have to understand that with the advent of
e-services the lead time to delivery has reduced considerably
the movement of the product and raw materials
this industry is divided into two parts
cannot move through e-services and it has to restrict the movement to roads,
rail, air, waterways and pipeline
transportation has improved considerably with the mechanical development
and development of technology within a short span
it plays a very important role in the supply chain
to distribute the goods from one place to another place
in an efficient and effective manner to satisfy the customer expectations
in this edition we have discussed the different modes of transportation
and the transport economies in a supply chain
in the next edition we will discuss the role of the warehousing, objectives,
the first one is the truckload
types of warehouses and the warehouse strategy in a supply chain
thank you
and the second one is less than truck load
truckload is used to move bulk quantities of goods
in the last edition we have discussed the role of transportation
which display the economies of scale with respect to the distance traveled
it is best suited for shipping
products between manufacturing facilities and the warehouses
less than truck load operations are priced
to encourage shipments in small lots,
usually less than a truck load less than truck load shipping
is suitable for shipments that are larger to be mailed as small puck packages
the characteristics of road transport:
road transport is a cheaper mode of transport for shorter distances
when compared to other modes of transportation
and the principles of transportation in a supply chain
it is a highly flexible mode of transportation
as the loading and unloading of goods is possible at any destination
and it also provides door to door service
road transportation helps to carry goods from one place to the another in hilly areas
it is the best suited mode of transportation
to handle smaller shipments over short distances
compared to other modes of transportation, the investments is less
limitations of road transport:
the carrying capacity of road transport is limited
and hence it is not economical for long distance transportation of goods
in this edition we will discuss the different modes of transportation
similarly, transportation of heavy goods or bulkier goods
by road involves high cost
the cost of maintenance of the trucks is increasing day by day,
resulting in increased transportation cost
let us now look into rail transport
railways plays a significant role in the moving goods
across the supply chain in the country
our country has the largest railway network
making it an important mode of transportation
freight trains are used in railways to move goods across the supply chain
and impact of transport economies in a supply chain
the freight trains are usually powered by
diesel, electricity and steam engines
depending upon the rail network they operate
the characteristics of railways are:
railway is the best suited transportation mode
for shipment of products like fertilizers, cement, food grains and coal
in large quantities from the production plant to the warehouses
it has the lowest variable cost
railways can work in tandem with other modes of transportation
to improve the efficiency of the supply chain
the different modes of transportation are given in the diagram
railway is suitable for carrying heavy goods in large quantities
over long distances at the lowest cost of transportation
it is relatively faster mode of transport
compared to road transport for a particular location
the limitations of rail transportation:
railway transportation is expensive for carrying goods over short distances
railway network is not available in all parts of the country
and hence goods cannot be moved through railway to those locations
it has to depend on other modes for reaching the destination
railways provide service according to fixed time table,
air, water, surface and multimodal transportation
which they plan and hence, it is not flexible for loading
or unloading of goods at any place according to the customer's requirement
water transport: water transportation
is the oldest mode of transportation
between countries as well as within countries where inland waterways are available
the characteristics of water transport are:
water transport is the cheapest mode of transportation
to move large bulk commodity such as mining, chemicals, cement,
and certain agricultural products it uses large ship
and commercial vessels that can carry billions of tons of cargo
there are five basic transportation modes
water transport is suitable for moving large quantities of goods
that are non-perishable in nature
it is an effective mode of transportation in international trade
the limitations of water transport:
water transport depends on the depth and navigability of rivers
and canals as this varies different transport vessels are needed
to operate in different places hence, this requires large investments
and their maintenance cost is also high
water transport is a slow moving mode of transport and therefore,
it may not be suitable for transporting perishable goods
air, water and surface surface has roadways, railways,
the water transport is adversely affected by weather conditions
which may affect the duration of movement and the delivery of the goods
air transport: air transport is the newest but least used mode of transportation
owing to its high cost of moving goods
though it is high cost, the speed in which they move
has other benefits for the supply chain on warehousing and inventory
at transport despite being high profile,
it still remains a potential transport mode for the supply chain
the characteristics of air transport:
air transportation is the best suited mode of transportation
and pipeline all transportation modes are vital
supply_chain_management_12808
they are sorted and packed according to the requirement of the customers
packed goods are then loaded into the transport
for shipment to the customers
warehouse is responsible for replenishment of stocks to meet the demand of the customer
they have to handle the return of goods,
which is very important for a supply chain
types of warehouses private warehouse:
private warehouse are owned and operated by a manufacturer
or a trader for shipping and storing its own products
it is suitable for firms that require special handling and storage features
till their actual use or sale and making them
and they want to control the design and operation of the warehouse
second, public warehouses: public warehouses are
owned and operated by central warehousing corporation
and the state warehousing corporation
it is licensed by the government they provide storage
and physical distribution on rental basis for small and large firms
public warehouses provide flexibility and cost competitiveness in the market
they can be classified as general merchandise, refrigerated,
special commodity and bonded warehouse
refrigerated warehouses are designed to store products
available conveniently whenever it is needed
which require frozen or chilled environment for storing the products
special commodity warehouses are designed to stock
specific products bonded warehouses are licensed by the government
to store products prior to the payment of import taxes and duties
these warehouses are located at the place of ports
to support the importers and exporters
co-operative warehouses: co-operative warehouses are owned,
managed and controlled by co-operatives socities
it facilitates the service at most economical rates to its members
contract warehouses:
a warehouse is a place to store inventory and it creates time utility
contract warehouses have the combination
of the characteristics of private and public operations
a contractual warehouse will offer a range of value added services
to their customers at the lowest possible cost
they will provide total logistics solution to their customers
warehouse strategy: a warehouse strategy
depends on the company's objectives and the logistics objectives,
which may be to make goods available to the customers,
to improve the customer service offered,
to minimize the total distribution cost
by bridging the gap between production and consumptions of goods
a warehouse strategy will focus on determining
the number of warehouses needed
and the type of warehouses needed for meeting the company's requirement
many firms use a combination of private, public
and contract warehouse facilities for their requirements
a private or contract facility may be used to cater to the requirements
of them throughout the year whereas the public facilities are used
by them to cater to the peak season requirements
there are other qualitative factors
which have to be considered the formation of the warehouse strategies
role of warehouse in a supply chain
they are one, presence synergies
a warehouse should be located near the market,
which will be able to support the inventory requirement
to meet the customer expectations
two, industry synergies: the warehouse should be able to
colette with the other firms in meeting the industry requirement
to get the benefit of multi products and the economies of scale
third, operating flexibility:
a warehouse should be able to adjust their internal policies and procedures
to meet the product variety and the customer needs
warehouse store inventory across the supply chain
as in when they require fourth, location flexibility:
a warehouse should be able to adjust the warehouse location
and the number of warehouses in accordance with the seasonal or permanent demand
changes of the market five, scale economies:
a warehouse should be able to reduce the material handling
and storage cost through the application of advanced technologies
these factors have to be considered
in determining the warehouse strategies
next, let us look at the warehouse location strategy
the warehouse location strategy depends on various factors like
to coordinate and serve the product supply and the consumer demand
quantity to be stored, nature and variety of the products stocked,
consolidation of the products needed to satisfy the market,
lead time, transportation costs, cost of land, tax structure of the region,
incentives provided by the government if any,
labour availability, cost of construction
and the cost of other utilities and the availability of other utilities
the site selection for the warehouse will have to be done
after analyzing the factors of location and decided
warehouse layout: warehouse layout
is the process of allocating space
this helps the members of the supply chain to have a continuous production
for the equipments and facilities needed for warehousing operation
it depends on the choice of material handling equipments to be used
and the design of floor plan to facilitate product flow
if the warehouses uses pallets,
then the first step is to determine the pallet size
allocation of space for the various functions of the warehouse
should be planned during the layout stage
the layout should be planned to protect against theft and pilferage
a good layout plan for a warehouse will improve its efficiency
automation in warehouse:
and improve their labour productivity
technology has enabled the warehouse operations
to start up and run smoothly to accommodate the rapid changes
successfully to meet the requirements of the business
pick to light technology, voice activated receiving and packing
has automated the warehouse process
transport management systems using rfid tags
helps in improving the warehousing process
today, we have a fully automated warehouse
using a warehouse management system and robots to help, handle products
this improves the efficiency of the warehouse
the need for inventory at different points of the supply chain
in the last edition, we have discussed the different modes of transportation
and the supply chain process
in this edition, we have discussed the role of the warehousing,
objectives, types of warehouses and the warehouse strategy in a supply chain
is achieved through the warehouse activities
and also it acts as a storage point for them
a warehouse has become part of the just in time production strategy
a centralized warehouse which manages parts inventory
to cater to the requirement of the production units
reduces the inventory to be stocked at the production centers
a warehouse which stores variety of products
helps to consolidate the multi product requirement
of the retail outlets of the supply chain
similarly, consolidation of products, quantity
and the transport economies in a supply chain
helped to get the benefit of transport economies
and thereby reducing the logistics cost
technology has influenced every aspect of warehouse operation
by creating better ways to perform the functions of
storage and handling of goods in a warehouse
objectives of warehouse:
the objectives of warehouse are to maximize the use of information,
space, equipment and labor,
to ensure the easy accessibility
and protection of assets and all items stored,
in this edition we will discuss the role of warehousing, objectives,
to focus on minimizing material handling cost
and to minimize the warehouse operating cost
warehouse benefits:
warehouse benefits can be classified as economic benefits and service benefits
consolidation and break bulk: in consolidation
the warehouse receives material from number of sources,
which are stocked and consolidated into a single shipment
to customers in a single location
this helps to reduce the transportation cost of moving goods to the customers
in break bulk, the warehouse receives a large shipment
types of warehouses and the warehouse strategy in a supply chain
from a single source, which is stocked
and then sorted out the requirements of different customers
and the delivery of goods happens to them
and economy of scale is achieved in moving goods to the warehouse
by these two methods sorting:
sorting is the process of re configuring the goods
as it flows from the origin to the destination
it is done through cross docking, mixing and assembly of products
cross docking is the process of combining inventory from multiple origins
into a required assortment for a specific customer and transporting the goods
warehousing:
mixing is the process of sorting inventory received from multiple origins
into a required combination of goods for a specific customer
and transporting goods at the lowest cost
assembly is the process of assembly of products
and components that are moved to the warehouse
from a second tier supplier for the manufacturing plant
third, seasonal storage: products manufactured
throughout the year, which have seasonal demand are stored in the warehouse
and sold during the seasons similarly, products which are produced
during seasons are stored in the warehouses,
warehousing refers to the activities involved in storage of goods
which are sold throughout the year this is known as seasonal storage
reverse logistics: the warehouse facilitates
the return of goods to the manufacturer
and helps the members of the supply chain to get their economic benefits
let us discuss the various service benefits
first one, spot stock:
manufacturers plan and stock seasonal goods in the warehouse
to improve their responsiveness to the market
they forecast the demand for the product and select the warehouse
where the stocks are maintained to satisfy their demand immediately
on a large scale in a systematic and orderly manner
this process is known as spot stock
second, assortment: manufacturers stock different products
manufactured by them in the warehouse
this enables the warehouse to cater to the
multi product requirements of the members of the supply chain
third, value added services:
a modern distribution warehouse specializes in performing a range
of value added services to change the physical features
or the configuration of the products to be shipped
to suit the requirement of the customer as given by retailers
it involves in holding or preserving goods in huge quantities
let us discuss now the warehouse operations
the warehouse activity starts from unloading of goods
received from the manufacturer
the goods received are to be checked for quantity and quality
once the goods are checked they are moved
to the place or storing in the designated place in the warehouse
when the order is received from the customer,
the warehouse initiates the process of order picking
order picking is the process of taking the stored product to the place of packing
when the required goods are picked from this warehouse,
from the time of their purchase or production
from the source and communicate them effectively to the members of the supply chain
accurate information helps the members of the supply chain
to plan and meet the supply chain requirements efficiently
in this edition, we have discussed
the concept of integrated logistics system
and its components in a supply chain
in the next edition, we will discuss the different activities
of the integrated logistics system in a supply chain
thank you
as well as satisfy the service level requirements
of each and every member in the supply chain
to meet the expectations of the customer
the learning objectives of this module are
to have an understanding of the concept of integrated logistics system,
to understand the activities of integrated logistics system,
to discuss the barriers of integrated logistics system,
to discuss the factors affecting integration of supply chain
the learning outcomes of this module are
an understanding of the importance of
welcome to all in this module, we are going to discuss
integrated logistics system in a supply chain,
an understanding of the activities of the integrated logistics system
and its components, an understanding of the obstacles
to integration of the supply chain,
an analysis of the factors for improving the integration of the supply chain
introduction:
supply chain integration is the process of coordinating various activities
across the supply chain which includes procurement,
manufacturing, distribution, inventory management,
transportation, warehousing and customer satisfaction
the integrated logistics management in a supply chain
from the raw material stage to the finish goods stage
and to the end customers integrated logistics management system:
integrated logistics management system is an interface between
the procurement, manufacturing and the distribution function
of the logistics function
to achieve the basic objectives of logistics
to provide better customer service at the lowest possible cost
integrated logistics management
is the process of anticipating customer needs and wants
acquiring the capital materials, people, technologies
let us have an introduction to supply chain
and information necessary to meet these requirements
and the wants of the customer the objectives of integrated logistics function:
the objectives are to provide better customer service
at the lowest cost, to ensure higher productivity
among the members of the supply chain, to avoid duplication of logistics
activity by better coordination among the members of the supply chain,
to monitor and improve the existing logistics system continuously
for improving the efficiency of the logistics system
in integrated logistics management,
coordination is brought into various activities
supply chain management is the set of activities
relating to procurement of materials, inventory flow
and physical distribution of materials across the supply chain
from the supplier point to the customer point
through manufacturing to the market
to satisfy the expectation of the customer
hence, integrated logistics management system
is referred to the set of activities relating to storage and flow of materials,
information and control system in a cost effective manner
if you look at the diagram, the relationship of
the logistics management system is evident
involved in the process of efficiently integrating the suppliers,
in an integrated logistics system,the flow of information happens in both directions
the backward information flow provides
information about the customers, their requirements,
heightened customer orders, quality specification,quality feedback,
procurement quality, production and dispatch planning
to facilitate the coordination across the supply chain
this information helps in defining and manufacturing quantity,
merchandising and purchase requirements down the supply chain
the forward information flow provides information
such as availability of products, order processing,
manufacturers, warehouses and stores
distribution schedule, time of delivery, quality assurance reports
and warranty details across the supply chain
inventory flow happens in the forward direction across the supply chain
during this process of flow value addition takes place
to meet the requirements of the customer at the required time
hence, the integrated logistics process focuses on
two interrelated activities, information flow
and inventory flow across the supply chain
all the members of the supply chain are expected to work together
to achieve the objective of meeting the expectation of the customer
supply chain distributes the products manufactured to the right destination
at the required time at the lowest cost
let us now discuss about the impact of inventory flow in integrated logistics system
the logistics operation starts from the shipment of raw materials
and parts from the supplier
to the manufacturer for processing to produce products
needed by the customers, which are to be delivered
at the required time as the inventory flows,
the material gains value
at every step of the transformation process
till it becomes the finished goods inventory
in the required quantities at the right time
the inventory flow comprises procurement, manufacturing support
and physical distribution
let us now look into the impact of information flow in integrated logistics system
information flow happens across the supply chain
in both directions to enhance the performance of the supply chain
this integrates the process of procurement, manufacturing
and physical distribution of the materials
to satisfy the requirements of products to different locations
or the required time along the supply chain
the key aspect of information flow is to get the right information
in order to minimize the total costs of supply chain
it acts as an interface between planning and coordination
as well as the operations in detailing the place,
timing and composition of the inventory to be positioned
this helps in balancing the timing and consolidation
to create efficient inventory flow through the value chain
manufacturing requirements: information flow helps to determine
the need for goods and services across the supply chain
to meet their requirement this initiates the manufacturing requirements
in the supply chain and the inventory deployment across the supply chain
the manufacturing requirement drives to prepare
the logistics operation starts from the shipment of raw materials
the master production scheduling
and the material requirement planning to meet the demand
the next element is procurement
procurement requirements are based on the manufacturing requirement,
the inbound logistics of raw materials and components are planned
and this helps in maintaining the product supplies continuously
forecasting:
information flow helps the supply chain
to predict the demand of the supply chain
to enable it to plan effectively and meet the requirements
and parts from the supplier to the manufacturer for processing
these are the elements which have the impact
on the planning and coordination flow
let us now discuss the various elements in operational flow
the operational information flow helps to provide
the data required for integrating the physical distribution,
manufacturing support and procurement operations
for meeting the requirement of the supply chain
the process of operational flow includes various elements starting from
order management, order processing, distribution operations,
inventory management, transportation and procurement
to produce products needed by the customer,
let us discuss these elements in detail
order management:
information flow helps to provide the information of the customers requirement,
which is translated across the supply chain
to plan and execute the same information
information technology has revolutionized
the process of order management process,
which helps in efficient process of logistics system
order processing: the process of order processing
involves in allocating the inventory
which are delivered at the required time
and or the planned manufacturing to meet the customer requirement
information technology has facilitated
faster and two way communication process across the supply chain
to share the needs of the customers and plan the logistics process
in satisfying the customer requirement distribution operations
information flow helps to facilitate
and coordinate the logistics process
by providing the product assortments to the distribution channel
to meet the customer requirements
this helps in improving the efficiency of the logistics system
as the inventory flows,the material gains value
inventory management: operational information flow
helps in deployment of the inventory
across the supply chain to satisfy the planned requirements
of the logistics process transportation:
operational information flow helps to
plan the movement of goods, documentation for the movement of goods
and the process of consolidation of goods
for efficient utilization of the transport capacity
whereby it decreases the logistics cost procurement:
operational information flow helps to share information
at every step of the transformation process
necessary to complete the purchase order preparation
and release of the same to ensure the continuous supply of
inbound logistics, to facilitate operations
that link customers and its suppliers
to summarize, planning and coordination flows
helps to provide information relating to planned activities
whereas the operational flows helps to provide
the information to direct the day to day activities of the supply chain
in this edition, we have discussed
the different activities of the integrated logistics system in a supply chain
till it becomes the finished goods inventory
in the next edition, we will discuss
the barriers of integrated logistics system
and the factors for integrating the supply chain effectively
thank you
the inventory flow comprises procurement, manufacturing support
and physical distribution as shown in the diagram below
let us discuss the each factor
in the last edition we have discussed the concept of
which affects the inventory flow
procurement: procurement is the process of purchasing
and arranging inbound movement of goods that is materials,
parts, semi finished goods, finished goods
from the suppliers to the manufacturer,
to warehouses and to the retail stores
it ensures the availability of materials,
products at the required place at the right time
manufacturing support the second component
where you require manufacturing support
integrated logistics system
which is concerned with the process of planning
and scheduling the production of products
they prepare the master production schedules,
the material requirement plan and arrange for
the timely availability of materials
and work in process for the manufacturing process
the important decision in manufacturing support
is to determine what to manufacture?
when to manufacture? and where to manufacture?
they manage the work-in process as it flows between the
and its components in a supply chain
stages of manufacturing
the third component in from an inventory flow is the physical distribution process
physical distribution is concerned with the movement of goods
across the supply chain it starts from the manufacturing point
to the customers through the intermediaries
physical distribution is an integral part of the marketing effort
to meet the requirements of products needed by the customers
at the right place and at the right time let us discuss the components of
information flow in an integrated logistics system
information flow happens across the supply chain in both directions
in this edition, we will discuss the different activities
to enhance the performance of the supply chain
this integrates the process of procurement, manufacturing
and physical distribution of the materials
to satisfy the requirements of products to different locations
at the required time along the supply chain
the key aspect of information flow is to get the right
information from the source and to communicate them effectively
to the members the supply chain accurate information
helps the members of the supply chain to plan
and meet the supply chain requirements efficiently
of the integrated logistics system in a supply chain
information flow has two main components
namely, planning and coordination flows
and operational flows as shown in the diagram below
let us discuss each component independently
let us look at planning and coordination flow
various elements of the supply chain
helps in coordination of the members across the supply chain
the elements are the strategic objective of the supply chain,
capacity constraint of the members of the supply chain,
the logistics requirement of the supply chain to move the products,
integrated logistics process focuses on two interrelated activities,
inventory requirement across the supply chain,
manufacturing requirements to satisfy the demand,
procurement of materials for production
and the forecasting of demand
let us discuss the elements
one by one strategic objectives:
strategic objectives are the driving force of the supply chain
which is based on the financial and marketing goals of the value chain
based on the objectives, the supply chain
determines the nature and the location of customers to serve
information flow and inventory flow across the supply chain
and determine their requirements of products and services to satisfy them
once they determine this, the supply chain
can estimate the requirement of resources to support inventory,
receivables,facilities,equipment and capacity needed
to satisfy the requirement of the customers
of the supply chain capacity constraint:
information flow shares the details about the demand
to be met by the supply chain
based on this, the supply chain identifies the limitations
and the bottlenecks in manufacturing capabilities
let us discuss the details of the inventory flow and its
to decide on the need for outsourcing the requirements to meet the customer demand
the next component is the logistics requirements
information flow help the supply chain to get the forecast of demand
and information regarding customer orders,
and the inventory status of the members of the supply chain
this helps the logistics department to plan distribution facilities
and other resources required for implementing the capacity plan
inventory deployment: information flow helps to determine
what, where and when the deployment of inventory
should be done in the logistics process
impact on the integrated logistics system
integration is shared information technology
development of a common database
and sharing of information across the supply chain
will enhance the integration of the logistics function
all the members will have adequate information
for making collaborative decision to improve the supply chain performance
in this edition, we have discussed the barriers of
integrated logistics system and the factors for
integrating the supply chain summary: in this module,
we have discussed the integrated logistics system
organizations must recognize the barriers
integration of supply chain is the process where a company and its trading partners
work together in a coordinated manner
to achieve the same business objectives
through integrated business process and information sharing
integrated logistics system
is an interface of procurement function,
manufacturing function and physical distribution function
of the total logistics function
in order to achieve the logistics objective of
satisfying the customer at the lowest possible cost
to the integration of the logistic process
inventory flow and information flow
are the two interrelated activities of the integrated logistics system
organizational structure, measurement systems,
inventory ownership and information technology
are the barriers of the integration process
effective communication, aligns management across the supply chain,
empowerment of employees and shared information technology
across the supply chain will result in improved coordination
across the supply chain members for an effective integrated logistics system
thank you
and address them for its efficiency
integration barriers of the logistics function
can be related to the organizational structure
and the measurement systems of the organization
inventory ownership across the supply chain
and the extent of information technology among the members of the supply chain
are also the barriers to the integration process
let us first discuss the organizational structure
in the last edition, we have discussed the different activities
organizational structure is formed based on the functional activities
an organization has to perform
managers are vested with the authority and responsibility
based on this every department
focuses on achieving its own performance based on the objectives
cooperation among the functional departments
is required to achieve the integration of the organization
the formal organizational structure
does not allow the integration and it hinders the process
to achieve successful integration of the logistics process
of the integrated logistics system in a supply chain
across the supply chain,the managers need to facilitate
cross functional coordination
beyond the functional organizational structure
the extent to which this integration happens
decides the successful integration of logistics function
the second barrier: measurement systems
poor measurement systems practices will be a substantial barrier
to the successful supply chain integration
if a manager cannot accurately cost a process,
identify the best supply chain partners, it becomes a challenge
in this edition, we will discuss the barriers of integrated logistics system
managers of the organization
facilitate the cross functional coordination
to achieve the integration of the logistics function
in this process, the managers increase their functional cost
for the sake of lowering the cost of the line integration
a measurement system is needed,
which does not increase the functional costs
during the process of cross functional coordination of the supply chain
to achieve the integration the third barrier:
inventory ownership inventory is maintained by the members
and the factors for integrating the supply chain effectively
across the supply chain to gain comfort and to protect against
uncertainties in supply and demand
this helps them to improve their efficiency
inventory poses a big barrier
to integrated logistics if they are incorrectly located
or when the inventory becomes obsolete
the fourth barrier: information technology
every member of the supply chain uses information technology
to improve their performance
the application of the information technology
barriers to logistics integration
is aligned to the organizational requirement
when integration happens, the databases of the organization
should be accessible to all the members across the supply chain
inadequate information systems support is an important barrier
for collaboration among the members across the supply chain
due to different technologies and the limitations in sharing of data
integration becomes difficult across the logistics function
to overcome these barriers,
and to have an effective supply chain integration, it is possible
that a company can focus on the following: communication
successful integration of logistics function
the most effective facilitators
focus on increasing the frequency
and the quality of inter-firm communication
communication across the supply chain members
will ensure that products and services
are moved to the customers efficiently and effectively
better communication contributes to
problem solving and building relationship
it helps in faster decision making
across the supply chain resulting in access to up to date information
across the supply chain is possible
this also helps to decide the requirement of inventory
across the supply chain appropriately in terms of location and quantity
the second factor which influences effective supply chain integration is
alliance management strengthening the relationship
across the supply chain helps in building an
effective supply chain when the number of players
across the supply chain is less
integrating the logistics function is easy
whereas when the number of players across the supply chain increases,
integrating the members by building relationship
when the internal process of the organizations
is difficult and is important for effective logistics function
the third important element for effective integration is people empowerment
cross-functional learning is important
for the integration of the supply chain activities
managers of the organizations have to be empowered
to make decisions on issues related to the coordinating activities
across the supply chain this will help them
to achieve higher levels of
inter-firm coordination and integrated logistics function
the fourth important element for effective supply chain
in the supply chain align with the overall function of the logistics activity
the two major activities in procurement management are
strategic sourcing and purchasing process
supply chain management is an infrastructure
for effectively carrying out the procurement management function
what is the strategic importance of
procurement management and supply chains?
whether it is manufacturing or service,
proactive purchasing plays a major role in ensuring competitiveness
supply chain managers are involved in
broader policy making aspects of procurement function,
that connects the suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and customers
music
participate in the new product development
and are responsible for selecting sources, managing cost
and maintaining strategic alliance with suppliers
music
procurement is a value addition to the customer
the value addition by procurement functions are quality,
music
reduced cost,
music
so, when we talk about supply chain and procurement,
continuity of supply,
music
building innovation,
music
maximizing profits and customer value
music
once a service or an item has been identified
as critical to the firm's operations, a supply process must be developed
with due consideration of the customer requirements,
supply base and technology road map
we can identify the activities of what materials are sourced?
with this brief introduction on procurement functions
and its strategic role in supply chain management
i request you all to ponder on the following:
identify and list the components
that are required to manufacture or shirt, a car or a computer
thank you and see you all in the lesson on strategic sourcing
make or buy decisions how materials are sourced?
music
supplier selection and strategy
music
how is the material bought? order processing
music
how materials arrive at a place of manufacturing?
hi! learners, in this lesson we will be discussing
inbound logistics
music
how companies receive, store and issue the materials?
material handling and control
music
how is the material procured converted into finished goods?
manufacturing
music
how are the finished goods transported and distributed to the consumers?
outbound logistics
procurement management and its impact on supply chain
music
when we look into it, we understand that the procurement decisions
have an impact across the supply chain from the product development
to the product distribution
so, learners having understood the impact of
procurement function across the supply chain activities,
we will move on to understand those important areas
in procurement, management and supply chain
the three important areas are
strategic role of procurement management,
there i can see all thing, why is procurement management
strategic sourcing and purchase process
the learning objectives of this module
is to provide insights to enhance knowledge in the areas
of operational issues in sourcing, procurement
and purchasing, decisions and processes for effective sourcing,
procurement and purchasing,
strategic role of procurement management for effective supply chain
by the end of the session, you will be able to identify
and solve issues related to procurement management for effective supply chain,
design effective procurement processes
considered as a supply chain function?
for sustainable procurement across the supply chain
now, we will move on to the first lesson
in procurement management in supply chain management
strategic importance of procurement management on supply chain
what is procurement management?
let us consider this with an example that you can imagine
and then relate it to the organizational perspective
imagine that you want to host a surprise birthday party
for your friend and invite twenty friends
and serve them with refreshments
should a supply chain manager
how will you get the refreshments? what do you do?
music
i will plan to buy a cake, some chips and coffee or soft drinks
music
plan the products and material requirement
i decide to make the cake and coffee and buy chips and soft drinks
make or buy decisions
music
i will buy the ingredients for making the cake
from a supermarket, chips and soft drinks from the kirana shop near my house
consider procurement issues for effective supply chain?
music
supplier identification and selection
music
i will place the order for chips and soft drinks,
take delivery of the products the previous day on payment of cash
music
purchase and take delivery of materials
i will prepare the cake the previous day and store it in the refrigerator
the soft drinks and the chips will be delivered the next day
the coffee will be purchased from the routine purchases made
the answer is just one and that is,
taking delivery and issuing it on time to meet the demand
music
so, learners if this is for a single event, you can imagine
what would be the procurement issues for an organization
who need to buy thousands and millions of components to manufacture
multiple products and provide services?
the solution is a systematic procurement management system
supported by supply chain infrastructure
what is procurement management?
procurement management includes decisions
supply chain management deals with
and processes for getting and ensuring availability of all the materials
needed to satisfy the customer need
the process includes: identification and specification of materials,
material requirement planning, make or buy decision,
identification and validation of sources,
supplier selection and relationship management,
contact of purchase activities,
material handling and inbound transportation,
tracking and managing supplier quality
and managing scrap
flow of materials and resources across all the activities

thank you and best wishes
fifteen weeks duration
the objectives of this online course or first to enable the students to gain knowledge about
functional foods and nutriceuticals
second, to have a thorough understanding about the health effects of functional foods and
dear learners, now let us conclude
or in some cases stop catalyses
in this module, we have studied in detail three common types of enzyme inhibitions namely
competitive, non-competitive, and substrate inhibition
that place a role in digestion of starch
and glycogen is considered a strategy for the treatment of disorders in carbohydrate
uptake
such as diabetes and obesity as well as dental caries and periodontal diseases
plants are an important source of chemical consequents with potential for inhibition
of alpha-amylase and can be used as therapeutic or functional food sources
in this week we shall got acquainted with enzymes, proteases inhibitors and amylase
amongst the phytoconstituents that has been investigated flavonoids are one of them
that demonstrated the highest inhibitory activities with the potential of inhibition related to
number of hydroxyl groups in the molecule of the compound
in the module on protease inhibitors, we learned that protease inhibitors are molecules that
block the activity of proteases
protease inhibitors can either be in the form of proteins, peptides or small molecules
the first plant protease inhibitor was isolated from soybeans and characterized in nineteen
forty-seven
they are grouped in two inhibitor families and are represented by two predominant inhibitor
from soybeans
inhibitors
the connects* soybean trypsin inhibitor that is sti and the bromelain burk trypsin and
chymotrypsin inhibitor that is bbi
that reduces the biological activity of trypsin by controlling the activation and catalytic
reactions of proteins
protease inhibitors have been examined extensively as therapeutic agents primarily to deal
with various human cancers effective against cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, inflammatory
diseases, and neurological disorders
thus, we have learned enzymes protease inhibitors and amylase inhibitors
in the next week, we shall study active biodynamic principles in spices
we studied that enzymes are biological catalysts, they increase the rate of chemical reactions
thank you and happy learning experience
taking place within living cell without themselves suffering any overall change
specific in character, acting on a particular substrate or substrates to produce a particular
product or products
their activity may be inhibited by compounds called enzyme inhibitors
they are substances which alter the catalytic action of enzyme and consequently slow down
hello! learners welcome to the tenth of our online course on functional foods and nutraceuticals
the second module, in this week, is amylase inhibitors
these are substances that bind to alpha-amylases making them inactive
they can inhibit the endogenous alpha amylases and mammalian alpha-amylase
to understand the health benefits of amylase inhibitors
we shall study the role of alpha-amylase in disorders of carbohydrate uptake,
disorders of carbohydrates uptake may cause severe health problem such as diabetes,
obesity and oral diseases all of which threatened and increasing worldwide population
amylase inhibitors play important role in prevention and treatment of diseases which shall
be dealt in detail in this module the third module
in this week will be protease inhibitors plants are good sources of protease inhibitors
hope you have enjoyed learning organosulfur compounds, introduction to anti-nutritional
which protect them against diseases, insects, *, and herbivores
protease inhibitors are now treated as very important signalling molecules
in many biological activities such as inflammation, apoptosis,
blood clotting, and hormone processing in recent years, protease inhibitors have
been examined extensively as therapeutic agents, primarily to deal with various human cancers,
cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, inflammatory diseases, and neurological disorders
let us learn more about protease inhibitors in this module
factors in foods and phytates in the last week in this week we shall study enzymes, protease
inhibitors and amylase inhibitors before studying these inhibitors
we shall study in brief what are enzymes and the role they play in our body?
we shall be revising the roles of digestive enzymes since protease and amylase enzymes
are concerned with digestion of proteins and starches respectively
we shall also study what are these enzymes inhibitors and their mechanism of action
this module shall also deal with specificity of enzymes, naming and classification,
digestive enzymes, and then effects of inhibitors on enzyme activity
dear learners, now let us conclude saponins are the glycosides containing non-sugar portion
hemagglutinins can cause growth inhibition in animals and diarrhoea, nausea, glutenin,
and vomiting in case of human being
when injected lectins agglutinate rbc hemolysis and that occurs in extreme cases
an introduction to the active biodynamic principles and spices, we learn that spices not only
enhance the flavour, aroma, and colour of food and beverages
but they can also protect people from acute and chronic diseases due to their high antioxidant
and anti-inflammatory activity
the most commonly used spices for culinary purposes that show biological activities are-
black pepper, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, cumin, fenugreek,
fennel, garlic,
aglycol that is saponin attached to sugar mighty by glycosidic linkage
gingerol, rosmarinic acid, quercitin, curcumin, eugenol, thymoquinone, piperine, allicin,
capsaicin, apigenin, luteolin, kaempferol, cyanidin, crocetin, crocin, diosgenin, eugenol,
cinnamaldehyde etcetera
we have also studied the role of these by active components with respect to antioxidant
potential, anti-inflammatory property, anti mutagenic
and anti-carcinogenic potential, anti lithogenic property, digestive stimulant action, hypolipidemic
effect and anti-diabetic influents
hope you have enjoyed learning saponins and hemagglutinin and an introduction to bioactive
compounds in spices, condiments and plant extracts
clinical studies have suggested that saponins affect the immune system in ways
from the next week, we shall start studying individual bioactive components in spices
with respect
to their structure, sources, effect of processing, physiological effects, and health benefits
and potential uses in foods
in the forthcoming week, we shall be studying spices mainly
we shall you studying bioactive components namely resveratrol, quercetin, kaempferol,
crocin, glutenin, cinnamaldehyde
thank you and happy learning experience
that help to protect the human body against cancers and also lower cholesterol levels
saponins decrease blood lipids, lower cancer risks, and lower blood glucose response
a high saponin diet can be used in the inhibition of dental caries and platelet aggregation
in the treatment of hypercalciuria in humans and as an antidote against acute lead poisoning
hemagglutinins any of a group of naturally, occurring glycoproteins, that cause red blood
cells that is erythrocytes to agglutinate are club together
these substances are found in plants in invertebrates and certain microorganisms
dear learners welcome to the eleventh week of our online course on functional foods and
legume plants
saponins which derived their name from their ability from stable soap like foams in aqueous
solutions, constitute a complex and chemically diverse group of compounds
in chemical terms, saponin contains a carbohydrate moiety attached to a tri-terpenoid or steroids
saponins are attracting considerable interest as a result of their diverse properties both
deleterious and beneficial
hemagglutinins, it refers to a substance that causes red blood cells to agglutinate, this
process is called as hemagglutination
antibodies and lactins are commonly known hemagglutinins
as in legumes most cereals commonly consumed by humans contain glycoprotein called lectins
nutraceuticals
many lectins can bind to intestinal epithelial cell
where they may impair nutrient absorption and cause damage that may allow infiltration
of bacteria into bloodstream
we shall study about saponins and hemagglutinins in more detail
plant materials are composed of vast array of bioactive principles
which are responsible for the therapeutic activities of medicinal plants
since the ancient times, spices and culinary herbs have been added to food to enhance flavor
and improve their organoleptic properties
spices and herbs have also been widely used as preservatives and medicine
in this module, we shall study- an introduction to bioactive components in spices, condiments,
hope, you have enjoyed learning enzymes, protease inhibitors, and amylase inhibitors last week
and plant materials
thank you
in this week, we shall start studying saponins and hemagglutinins
which is the last component, we are studying under other components having anti-nutritional
effects
from this week, we shall start studying active bio-dynamic principles in spices, condiments,
and plant extracts
let me now introduce you these topics
saponins are naturally occurring compounds that are widely distributed in all cells of
now let us conclude learners, resveratrol is the nutraceutical belonging to stilbenoid
numerous in vitro and some animal studies support our role of kaempferol and quercetin
in the prevention
and or treatment of other diseases also such as-
neurodegenerative diseases, infectious diseases, diabetes, osteoporosis, anxiety, allergies,
inflammation, and pain
cinnamaldehyde occurs naturally in the bark of cinnamon trees
and other species of the genus cinnamomum, like camphor and caesium
many of the health benefits of cinnamon and its effect on metabolism is due to the presence
of cinnamaldehyde in it
it helps to fight against tooth decay and bad breath, and so the hub of cinnamon is
group
used for enhancing oral health
cinnamaldehyde has been reported to have the vasodilation property action in vitro
cinnamaldehyde exhibit antimicrobial activity, anti-diabetic, anticancer activity, and anti-inflammatory
activity
crocin is the chemical constituent, isolated from the saffron, and the dried trifled stigma
of the plant crocus sativus, and also from the fruits of gardenia
it is found to be effective as antiproliferative, antioxidant,
latent, and alzheimer's disorder
saffron and crocin may improve the function of central nervous system and mental health
widely distributed in plant kingdom and with several therapeutic effects
status
through regulating the synthesis of chemical neurotransmitters in the brain including dopamine,
norepinephrine, and serotonin
luteolin is found in plant materials, often in the form of glycoside
which are usually metabolized by the intestinal bacteria, cleaved
and gluconated during uptake in the gut, and metabolized in the organism
when it comes to the pharmacological activities of luteolin
it is often associated with its ability to induce apoptosis
which involves redox regulation, dna damage, protein kinases
which inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells and suppression of metastasis and angiogenesis
the main biological potential of resveratrol belongs to cardioprotection
hope you have enjoyed learning resveratrol, quercetin, kaempferol, crocin, and cinnamaldehyde,
this week
in the next week, we shall study other bioactive components in other spices
thank you and happy learning experience
apart from its cardioprotective effects resveratrol also exerts anti-carcinogenic,
antiviral, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties
flavonols, flavones, and flavonoids widely distributed in the plant kingdom
epidemiological studies have found a positive association between the consumption of kaempferol
and quercetin containing foods and a reduced risk of developing cardiovascular diseases
and some types of cancers
dear learners welcome to the twelfth week of our online course on
which provides resveratrol with the ability to bind to many bio-molecules
quercetin are naturally occurring flavonoids that function as active dietary antioxidants
these flavonoids are universal in foods including vegetables such as onions, garlic, and ginger,
fruits such as apples, and in tea and wine most research has focused
on the antioxidant properties of quercetin its effect on several enzyme systems, and
on biological pathways involved in carcinogenesis, inflammation, and cardiovascular diseases
kaempferol is a natural flavonol, a class of flavonoid
found in many fruits, vegetables and herbs including grapes, tomatoes, broccoli, and tea
this biologically active compound exhibits many pharmacological activities including anti-oxidant,
anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-diabetic, and anti-cancer activities

cinnamon, it contains essential oils and other compounds such as cinnamyl, cinnamic acid,
cinnamaldehyde, and cinnamate cinnamaldehyde is the major component
comprising eighty-five percent in the essential oil, and the purity of cinnamaldehyde in use
is high, that is more than ninety-eight percent cinnamaldehyde is the aldehyde that gives
cinnamon its flavor and odor it occurs naturally in the bark
of cinnamon tree and other species of the genus cinnamomum like camphor and cassia
the color of saffron comes from the water-soluble carotenoids, including crocetin and crocins
crocins are effective anti-depressant and anti-anxiety agents as well as sexual motivator,
memory enhancer, and sedative, which are used for the treatment of different
central nervous system disorders luteolin is present in celery, parsley,
and hemagglutinins and an introduction to spices, condiments, and plant extracts in the last week
broccoli, onion leaves, carrots etcetera various epidemiological studies have led
to the discovery of the anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic effects of luteolin
these properties are partly due to its anti-oxidant and
free radical scavenging capacities in this week we shall learn about these
bio-active components namely resveratrol, quercetin, kaempferol, cinnamaldehyde,
crocin, and lutanin thank you!
we shall study bio-active compounds namely resveratrol, quercetin,
kaempferol, cinnamaldehyde, crocin, and lutanin in this week
let me give you a brief introduction of these bioactive compounds
plants contain, containing resveratrol have been used efficiently in traditional medicine
for over two-thousand years it can be found in some plants,
fruits and derivatives, such as red wine resveratrol displace a wide range of
valuable properties and this may be due to its molecular structure
dear learners welcome to the thirteenth week of our online course on functional foods and
capsaicin is an active component of chili peppers, which plants are belonging to the
genus capsicum
it is an irritant for mammals including humans and produces a sensation of burning in any
tissue with which it comes in contact
capsaicin and several related molecules are known by the collective name capsaicinoids
it has several health benefits which we shall be studying this week
piperine is responsible for the black pepper distinct biting quality
piperine has many pharmacological effects and several health benefits which will be
dealt in this week
gingerols are the major constituents of fresh ginger and are found slightly reduced in dry
nutraceuticals
ginger
whereas the concentration’s of sugar, which are the major gingerol dehydration products
are more abundant in dry ginger than in the fresh ginger
the active components in cloves are eugenol and isoeugenol
eugenol has recently become a focus of interest because of its potential role in elevating
and preventing chronic diseases such as cancer, inflammatory reactions and other conditions
the radical scavenging and active-inflammatory activities of eugenol have been shown to modulate
chronic diseases invitro and in vivo
thymoquinone is the prime component of the essential oil obtained from “nigella sativa seeds”
commonly known as black cumin, black caraway, kalonji, and black onion seeds
hope you have enjoyed learning resveratrol, quercetin, kaempferol, crocin, cinnamaldehyde,
we shall be studying in more details about thymoquinone
apigenin, it belongs to the flavon subclass and is abundant in vegetables, fruits and
beverages, such as parsley, grapes, apples, chamomile tea and red wine
apigenin is also one of the active ingredients in chinese medicinal herbs
it serves multiple physiological functions such as strong anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant,
anti-bacterial
and anti-viral activities, and blood pressure reduction
therefore apigenin has been used as a traditional medicine for centuries
throughout history, rosemary has been famous for its medicinal properties and its ability
to improve memory
and lutanin in the twelfth week
rosmarinic acid has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and anti-allergic activities
in this module, we shall study the structure, chemical properties, extraction, bio-availability,
health benefits of rosmarinic acid
in this week we shall study seven different bio-active components in spices
and condiments, namely capsaicin, piperine, eugenol, gingerol, thymoquinone, apigenin
and rosmarinic acid
we have studied about the physiological effects of these bioactive compounds under introduction
to active bio-active principles in spices and condiments
let me now give you a brief introduction of these major bioactive compounds
now let us conclude, in this week, we have studied fenugreek and diosgenin
it also acts as a cardioprotective agent
conjugated linoleic acid also known as bovinic acid, as it is produced naturally in the digestive
tract of ruminants like cattle, goats, and sheep
the main dietary source of conjugated linoleic acid is beef and meat, milk and eggs, and
meat of grass-fed animals
conjugated linoleic acid is also available as a supplement commercially, conjugated linoleic
acid
as a recognized for its potential anti-carcinogenic, anti-diabetic, anti-atherogenic, and immune-modulatory
functions in animal and human beings
one of the most important bioactive nutrients that is alpha-linolenic acid or ala commonly
we have also studied conjugated linoleic acid and omega-three fatty acids
referred as omega-three fatty acids or n-three fatty acids
omega-three fatty acid is an essential fatty acid as it cannot be synthesized in the body
and must be supplemented in the diet
on consumption, it is the precursor of long-chain fatty acids that is eicosapentaenoic
acid (epa) and docosahexaenoic acid that is dha
-
the other omega-three fatty acids like epa and dha are both found in fatty fish and shellfish
the functional properties of omega-three fatty acids showed a verity of therapeutic functions
like anti-inflammatory, anti-cholesterol, brain function boosting, antidepressant,
fenugreek due to its appreciated bioactive components, it has many therapeutic applications
anti-
carcinogenic properties it is also known to bring in significant production in blood lipids, hypotension and increase
body immunity
one must also be causes to use omega-three dietary supplements in excess as it may interfere
with certain drugs like anticoagulanting medications
hope you like online on omega-three fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid
in the next week which will also be our last week of online course on functional foods
and nutraceuticals
we shall study non-nutrient effects of proteins, peptides and nucleotides, vitamins, and minerals
thank you and happy learning experience
such as antioxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-carcinogenic, hypoglycemic, hypercholesterolemic are the
major medicinal properties of fenugreek as established in various
studies the evidence thus far reported in the literature on diosgenin supports the idea
that this fenugreek component exerts beneficial effects on several physiological markers relevant
to metabolic syndromes
hyperlipidemia
dear learners welcome to the fourteenth week of our online course on functional foods and
subjects
fenugreek has been used as a spice throughout the world to enhance the sensory quality of
foods
among the different bioactive compounds found in fenugreek, the major chemical constituents
we shall be learning in more detail about these bio-active compounds
from this week we shall start learning about the non-nutrient effects of nutrients namely-
proteins, peptides
and nucleotides, conjugated-linoleic-acid, and omega-three-fatty-acids, minerals, and
vitamins
nutraceuticals
let me first explain to you what are these non nutrient effects of nutrients?
we know that nutrients are substances that can carry out one or more functions of foods
and deficiency of which generally results into deficiency diseases
carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals are the nutrients
however, some nutrients besides their role as nutrients can also show pharmacological
benefits which when consumed
these are known as non-nutrient effects
in this week we shall introduce you to conjugated linoleic acids and omega-three-fatty-acids,
their chemistry, natural food sources, metabolism and bioavailability
their therapeutic benefits and perspectives of food application
hope you have enjoyed learning different bio-active compounds in spices
and condiments namely capsaicin, piperine, eugenol, gingerol, thymoquinone, apigenin
and rosmarinic acid last week
in this series of bio-active components, we shall study the last compound diosgenin which
is present in fenugreek
we shall also cover the health benefits of other bio-active compounds present in fenugreek
to cover maximum bio-active compounds of spices, we have presented their brief accounts in
videos but you can refer e-text to get deeper knowledge and better understanding of these
dear learners welcome to the fifteenth week of our online course on functional foods and
in human health besides their known functions
and in weight-reducing diets and the role of peptides and nucleotides as nutraceuticals
or functional foods
the second module of this week will be on non-nutrient effects of nutrients with respect
to vitamins
the role of vitamins in the human body is like the simple spark plug to the automobile
without which the automobile will remains stationary
all living cells and organisms likewise require many organic compounds to sustain metabolic
reactions
nutraceuticals
processes
this module aims to enlighten the learners on specific health benefits of vitamins, in
addition to their physiological roles
now the last module will be on the minerals
minerals are chemical constituents used by the body, for the maintenance of certain physico
chemical processes which are essential for life although they yield no energy
they have important roles to play in many activities in the body
these must be supplied in the diet and vary from grams to micrograms per day, for the
macro and microelements respectively
hope you have enjoyed learning fenugreek, and diosgenin, and conjugated linoleic acid,
the physiological role and health benefits of minerals will include calcium, phosphorous,
magnesium, sodium, potassium
and chloride that is * micro and iron, zinc, selenium, chromium,
manganese, iodine, and fluorine, these are micro minerals
and omega three fatty acids
in this week we shall study non nutrient effects of specific nutrients with respect to proteins,
peptides, and nucleotides, vitamins, and minerals
this last week module will be taught by my mentor and teacher doctor sabiha vali, former
professor and head, department of home science, rastrasanth tukroji maharaj nagpur university,
nagpur
dear learners in this week you will be introduced to the role of proteins, peptides and nucleotides
dear learners, in the first week we have studied the history, definition, and classification
although, commonly clearly existed between definitions offered by different health-oriented
professional organizations
but finally, in “two-thousand-seventeen” functional food centre usa defined functional
foods by providing clarity and more comprehensive understanding of its meaning
module-three described the classification of functional foods and nutraceuticals according
to source or origin, nutrient and non-nutrient, organ or organ system, modifications in foods
specific functional components, mechanism of action, and chemical nature of food
and in the third module, we have studied the preserved effect of functional foods and nutraceuticals
this module has given us the brief account of how inclusion and consumption of (bio)
biological active ingredients in foods and vegetables has been linked to help battle non-communicable
of functional foods and nutraceuticals
diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and gastrointestinal tract disorders
please do attempt self-assessment and practice assignment at the end of every module
this will help you to prepare yourself for final examination
please do not forget to fill feedback form
in the next week, we shall study basic concepts of probiotics, pre-biotics, sin-biotics, and
post biotics
we shall begin with taxonomy and important characteristics of probiotic microorganisms
and health effects and mechanism of action of probiotics
thank you and happy learning
history showed us that the term “functional food” was born in japan, and the japanese
were the first to observe that the food could have a role beyond nutrient supply
japan was the first country to legislate these products as foods of specified health use
europe and the american countries incorporated later the concept of added value of food
second module taught us definitions of functional foods and nutraceuticals given by several
health-oriented professional organization
there were no universally accepted definitions for functional foods and nutraceuticals till
two-thousand-seventeen
hello learners, welcome to online course on functional foods and nutraceuticals
resources for references
at the end of each video self-assessment in the form of ungraded four to five mcqs, and
mcqs, msqs, and practice assignment of one-word answers or true-false questions will be asked

the videos need to be watch very carefully without fast-forwarding it
the software swayam two point zero through which this course is being launched monitors the progress
of every student through inbuilt analytics
in the first week, we shall be dealing with the introduction of functional foods and nutraceuticals
it will be covered in three modules, namely history and definition, classification, and
perceived effects and health benefits of functional foods on nutriceuticals
module-one shall cover history and definition of functional foods and nutraceuticals, given
by several health-oriented professional organizations
module-two shall cover different type of classifications
dear learners, you may find the names of bio-active compounds a bit difficult to remember initially
tukadoji maharaj nagpur university, nagpur, and course coordinator of this course
but in due course of time, you will find them easy
the third-module shall give you an idea about, the perceive effect of functional foods and
nutraceuticals and their health effects, with respective non-communicable diseases
so wishing you all the best and happy learning experience
before giving you the details of week one module
let me first explain to you about this course
there are five units and shall be taught in forty modules in fifteen weeks duration
every week two to three modules will be taught, and each module shall comprise of thirty minutes
video
split into three parts of ten-ten minutes each
it will also have lecture notes in the form of e-text or further reading and additional
dear learners, now in the second week we have studied introduction to probiotics, pre-biotics
they may be consumed in the form of raw vegetables and fruits, fermented pickles or dairy products
further, in the fifth module, we have studied about the taxonomy and important features
of probiotic microorganisms namely lactobacillus and bifidobacterium, lactic acid bacteria
are gram-positive and non-sporing, catalyst negative organisms that are divide of cytochromes
and of non-aerobic habit but are aero-tolerant, fastidious, acid-tolerant, and strictly fermentative
lactic acid is the major end product of sugar fermentation
bifidobacterium are gram-positive polymorphic branched rods that occurs singly in chains
or clumps, and they are non-spore-forming,
non-motile, and non-filamentous they are anaerobic and chemoorganotrophs having
a fermentative type of metabolism
and sin-biotics, taxonomy and important features of probiotic microorganisms, and health effects,
we also learned about the health effects and mechanism of action of these probiotic microorganisms
the module taught us in detail “how pro-biotics work” through enhancement of the epithelial
barrier, increased adherence to intestinal mucosa, inhibition of pathogen adhesion, competitive
exclusion of pathogenic microorganisms, production of antimicrobial substances and modulation
of immune system
under health benefits, we have studied anti-inflammatory activity, anti-cancer activity, anti-allergic
activity, angiogenic activity, and anti-obesity effects of probiotics
as well as effects of probiotics on brain and central nervous system
in the forthcoming module, we shall study about pro-biotics in various foods and the
quality assurance of pro-biotics and safety
and mechanism of action of probiotics
please do attempt self-assessment and practice assignment at the end of every module
this will help you to prepare yourself for final exam
please do not forget to fill feedback form
so, wishing you a happy learning
thank you
the fourth module may does familiar with the basic concepts of difference between pro-biotic,
pre-biotic, sin-biotic, and pros-biotics, we have gained knowledge about the pro-biotic
microorganisms namely lactobacillus and bifidobacterium, and how are they beneficial to our health
the importance of pre-biotics
and their mechanism of action have also been dealt upon
the introduction of probiotics, pre-biotics or sin-biotics into human diet is favourable
for the intestinal microbiota
dear learners, in the third week, we have studied pro-biotics in various foods and quality
and fruit juices and soy-products
we have also studied classification of pro-biotic foods namely traditional dairy-based pro-biotic
foods, such as curds, yogurt, cheese, buttermilk
dairy-based non-fermented foods like pro-biotic ice creams
non-dairy-based foods like fruits and vegetable juices, purees, pulps, chunks, soya milk,
beverages, fermented cereal-based beverages, probiotic liquids
we have also studied some commonly consumed traditional dairy-based
non-dairy
for lactic acid bacteria to be used as pro-biotics which includes the ability to exert a beneficial
assurance of pro-biotics and safety
effect on the host withstand into a boost up at a high cell counts, and remain viable
throughout the shelf life of the product, withstand transit through gastrointestinal
track, adhered to intestinal epithelial cell lining and colonize the lumen of the tract
produce anti-microbial substances towards the pathogens and technologically suitable
for industrial process and stabilize the intestinal microflora and be associated with the health
benefits
this module has also taught us to identify safety measures regarding production, manufacture
related to the technological aspects, application, survival, and colonization in the host and
their health benefits to monitor general aspects, functional aspects and health aspects of quality
assurance of probiotics and safety, optimize production aspects, and quality control aspects
under pro-biotics in various foods, we have studied dairy and non-dairy foods, fermented
while selecting the pro-biotics strains
please do attempt self-assessment practice assignment at the end of this module
this will help you to prepare yourself for final exam and please do not forget to fill
feedback form
in the next week, we shall start prebiotics namely oligosaccharides and resistant starch
so, thank you and happy learning experience
and non-fermented pro-biotic foods
we learnt the concepts of carrier foods and role of milk and milk fats and pre-biotics
in delivering pro-biotics at the target sites
milk and milk fats through their buffering action protects pro-biotics from the harsh
conditions of the gastrointestinal tract
ice creams have been used as carrier foods for pro-biotic delivery
this module also delt upon the non-dairy fermented and non-fermented foods such as vegetable
hello learners, welcome to the third week of our course on functional foods and nutraceuticals
this module shall also deal with the concept of carrier foods, and roll of milk and milk
fats, and prebiotics in delivering the probiotics at the target sides
various fermented and non-fermented vegetable and fruit juices and soy production shall
also be discussed
certain probiotic foods commonly consumed will also be discussed
the module on quality assurance of probiotics and safety shall deal with the conditions
and criteria for the proper selection of probiotics for their safety
and desirable benefits and how the ability of prebiotic microbes can be retained during
production, manufacturing, distribution and storage prior to reaching to the consumers
we have tried to explain to you these topics in a very simplified way
i hope you have enjoyed learning basic concepts of probiotics last week
if you find it very difficult please do convey us through our feedback forms
please do attempt self-assessment, practice assignment at the time of every module
this will help you to prepare yourself for final examination and please do not forget
to fill feedback form
last week, we have studied probiotics with respect to introduction to probiotics, prebiotics
and synbiotics, as well as we have studied taxonomy and important features of probiotic
microorganisms
and health effects of mechanism of actions of probiotics
in the third week, we shall be studying probiotics in various foods and quality assurance of
probiotics and safety
under probiotics in various foods, we shall study diary and non-diary probiotic foods,
and fermentate and non-fermentate probiotic foods
hello learners, in this week, we have studied prebiotics namely oligosaccharides and resistant
fructooligosaccharides are being claimed to improve mineral absorption and decrease phospholipids,
serum cholesterol and triglycerides
these properties have drawn the interest of food interest industry, for the application
of functional oligosaccharide as partial substitute for fats and sugars in food formulation
the tenth module on dietary fiber explained its definition, classification, physicochemical
properties, sources, and applications as well as functional foods property
we learnt that dietary fibers cannot be digested, and absorbed in the human small intestine
instead, it can be fermented in the large intestine by colin microorganisms, to produce
short-chain fatty acids which in turn can be absorbed and contribute to human health,
such as anti-tumour and anti-inflammation properties
starch
we have also studied classification of dietary fiber, according to solubility in water, as
water-soluble fiber, less fermented fibers namely cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and
water-soluble and well-fermented fibers, such as pectins, gums and mucilages
this module has also described the role of fiber, in managing blood glucose levels, lipid
profile, improvement constipation, and weight management, besides laxation, appetite control
and prebiotic effect in producing short-chain fatty acid production
dear learners, i hope these modules have cleared your concept of oligosaccharides and dietary
fiber
in the next week, we shall study two more prebiotics namely resistant starch and gums
so all the best and happy learning experience
hope these modules have given you a deep insight into prebiotic aspects of these category
thank you
oligosaccharides is a kind of naturally occurring carbohydrates, that are made up of three to
ten monosaccharide units, linear or branched linked by alpha or beta glycosidic linkages
we have also studied the functional oligosaccharides namely isomaltooligosaccharides, glucooligosaccharides,
the classification and mechanism of action has also been dealt with
besides this fructans and inulins have also been discussed
in addition for the use as prebiotics to enhance, the growth of beneficial bacteria in colon
hello learners, welcome to the fourth week of our course on functional foods and nutraceuticals
the basic concept of prebiotics has already been explained in the second week, fourth
module
prebiotics are mostly fibers that are non-digestible food ingredients, and beneficial effect the
in the colon, generally lactobacilli and bifidobacterium
we all are aware of carbohydrates and its classification, according to saccharide groups
you must have studied mono-saccharides, di-saccharides and poly-saccharides in much detailed during
graduation
but many of you might not have studied oligosaccharides which are made up of three to ten monosaccharide
units, lenoir or branched linked by alpha or beta glycosidic linkages
and hope you have enjoyed learning about, probiotics in various foods and quality assurance
our subject expert doctor renuka mainde will explain structure, sources, uses, and their
health benefits of oligosaccharides as prebiotics
the next module which shall be dealt in this week is dietary fiber
dietary fiber is a well-known polysaccharide, among the population because of its role in
prevention of non-communicable diseases namely diabetes, obesity, and cancers
our subject expert doctor renuka mainde shall explain to you about the classification, sources
and health benefits of dietary fiber as a functional food
nan:nan:nan
of probiotics and safety last week
probiotics in various foods gave us information on dairy and non-dairy probiotic foods and
fermented and non-fermented probiotic foods
we have also seen some of the commonly consumed dairy-based and non-dairy based probiotic
foods
the module on quality assurance of probiotics and safety taught us the characteristics of
ideal probiotics, and selection criteria for lactic acid bacteria, to be used as probiotics
in this week we shall study prebiotics namely, oligosaccharides and resistant starch
hello learners, in the fifth week we have learned about resistant starch and gums,
and micronutrient absorption, and thermogenesis the most important aspect of the resistance
starch, we have studied was effect of processing on resistance starch
the twelfth module was on gums in this module, we have studied different
sources of gums like plants such as present in seed code, exudates, microbial such as algae
bacteria most of the common gums comes from exudates, which are secreted by specialized
cells at the site of injury to form exudates, which immediately
solidified on exposure to atmosphere they serve the plant, to seal wounds
and prevent infection by microorganisms we have seen that gum is a good source of
soluble fiber, and contains calcium, sodium and a small amount of protein
it is a complex polysaccharide, primarily indigestible to both humans and animals,
which works as prebiotics we studied that resistant starch as the name
which is not broken down in the intestine but undergoes colonic fermentation,
by colonic bacteria and can cause alteration of the gum microflora
gums have also been found, to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation of the intestinal mucosa,
enhances dental remineralization and nephroprotectant
gum arabic has pro absorptive properties and can be used in diarrhoea
thus we have studied four bio prebiotics namely, oligosaccharides,
dietary fibers, resistant starch and gums from the next week, we shall start studying other
food components with potential health benefits thank you and best wishes
proposes is the portion of starch, that escapes the digestive system in small intestine, which is
resistant to digestion, passes further into colon were it act as a substrate for microbial
fermentation, the end products being gases, organic acids,
short-chain fatty acids, our branched as a short-chain fatty acids and alcohols
there are four types of resistant starch, depending upon their characteristics namely
r s one, r s two, r s three, and r s four the health benefits of resistance starch studied,
are improved glycemic and insulinemic responses, bowel health,
blood lipid profile, increased satiety and reduce energy intake,
hope, you have enjoyed learning polyphenol module
flavonoids specially the flavonols, quercetin and conferol play a powerful role in heart
disease
by disrupting, the function of microorganisms like viruses or bacteria
the ability of flavonoids to chalate or bind, metal ions contribute to their antioxidant
activity invitron
flavonoids are helpful in inhibiting tumor growth promotion and progression
flavonols induce and increase in the growth of lactobacillus species and bifido bacterium
species
module on polyphenol also described catechins
let us know conclude, we studied that polyphenols are a group of chemical substances, found
catechins have been regarded as the characteristic compounds in green tea, for daily beverage
and crude medicine in asia, especially in china and japan for thousands of years
green tea contains high concentrations of four main types of catechins
with respect to catechins we have also learn, that they exert anti diabetic activity
by inhibiting the alpha amylase and alpha glucosidase activities, inhibiting glucose
absorption in the small intestine
protecting the pancreatic beta-cells, improving insulin sensitivity of peripheral organs and
inhibiting gluconeogenesis
that is glucose production from non carbohydrates, such as amino acids in the liver
in plants
green tea contains various components, with specific health promoting effects and is believed
to have protective effects against disease
such as cancer, obesity, diabetes, hepatitis and nuerodegenerative diseases
however, conflicting results have also been reported, since confounding factors could
affect the results
future studies should eliminate such factors, to better understand the benefit of green
tea for human health
with this know, we have completed thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth modules on polyphenol,
tannins and catechins respectively
in the next week, we shall study phytoestrogens, phytosterols and glucosinolates
characterized by the presence of more than one phenolic unit or building block or molecules
thank you, and happy learning experience
we have studied structure, sources of flavoinoids such as flavonols and flavones, isoflavones
and flavonols, phenolic acids and derivatives, tannins, still bins and lignins
the module on polyphenols taught us, that fruits, vegetables, legumes, soy products,
algae are rich sources of dietary flavonoids
most of the health benefits of flavonoids are due to their antioxidant activity
hello learners, hope you have enjoyed learning phytoestrogens, phytosterols, and glucosinolates
caused by estrogen deficiency
the phytoestrogens may be of particular benefit to premenopausal and postmenopausal women
phytoestrogens may also play a role in fighting cancer
however, much more research is needed to understand this
the second module of this week dealt with phytosterols and phytostanols
which are compounds found in plant origin foods
they are structurally associated with cholesterol
but differ in their structure of the side chain
phytosterols have been classified into two types
let us now conclude, the module on phytoestrogens taught us that they are plant-based compounds
sterols which have a double bond in the stereology hence known as unsaturated compounds
stanols which like a double bond in the stereology, so are saturated molecules
we also studied effects on health, which showed that phytosterols may produce health benefits
in animals
humans such as reduction of cholesterol levels, with decreased risk of coronary heart disease,
anti-inflammatory activities
induction of apoptosis in cancer cells and disease prevention and treatment
the third module, which we learn was glucosinolates
this module acquainted us, that glucosinolates are a large group of plant secondary metabolites,
with nutritional effect and are mainly found in cruciferous plants
that mimic estrogen in human body
after injection glucosinolates could be partially absorbed in their intact form, through the
gastrointestinal mucosa
however, the largest fraction is metabolized in the gut lumen
when cruciferous are consumed without processing myrosinase enzyme present, in these plants
hydrolyzes the glucosinolates
in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract, to various metabolites such as isothiocyanates,
nitriles, oxazolidine- two -thiones, and indole- three -carbinols
isothiocyanates are potentially anti-carcinogenic
phytochemicals that are the result of the metabolism of glucosinolates
we studied that the health benefits of glucosinolates are antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cancer-protective,
the majority of phytoestrogens found in typical human diets can be categorized into two primary
anti-diabetic, cholesterol-lowering and role in reducing neurodegenerative diseases
we have also seen, the toxicity that exclusive feeding or excessive feeding of vegetables
or and seeds
from the brassica family has been associated with toxic effects in life stocks, like reduce
fat intake, alterations of hepatic detoxification system
enlarge thyroid reduced plasma thyroid hormone levels, occasional organ abnormalities, decreased
growth, decreased reproductive performance and even motility
thyroid carcinomas have also been reported in few studies, when thioglycosides, metabolize
to thiocyanates
we have now completed the seventh-week module on phytoestrogens, phytosterols and glucosinolates
classes isoflavones and lignans
in the next week, we shall study carotenoids, anthocyanins, lycopene, and curcumins
thank you and wishing you happy learning experience
isoflavones makeup, the most common form of phytoestrogens
two of the majors' isoflavones found in humans are genistein and dioxin
in plants, isoflavones are inactive, when present in bound form as glycosides but when
the sugar residue is removed, these compounds become activated
the phytoestrogens have been found, to be beneficial in combating symptoms and conditions
dear learners welcome to the seventh week of our online course on functional foods and
and type two diabetes, protection against breast cancer, prostate, and other cancers
in this module, we shall study in detail about definition, structure, classification, sources,
and health benefits of phytoestrogens
we are also going to learn about phytosterols and phytostanols, which are foods of plant
origin
phytosterols have a similar structure as cholesterol but they differ in the structure of the side
chain
as phytosterols are found in only plant foods, the foods containing phytosterols are usually
healthy foods like unrefined plant oils, vegetable, nuts and olive oils
they have been known to reduce the incidence of coronary artery disease and serum cholesterol
nutraceuticals
content
the other health benefits of phytosterols are increase in immunity and anti-carcinogenic
effects
let us now know more phytosterols and phytostanols
this module highlights, the types of phytosterols, structure, sources
its absorption mechanism, properties and perspectives for food applications of plant sterols and
stanols
the third module in the seventh week is glucosinolates
these are a large group of sulfur-containing glucosides present in cruciferous vegetables,
belonging to brassicaceae family
hope you have enjoyed learning polyphenols, tannins and catechins in the last week
cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, mustards, rapeseed, canola etcetera, are the examples
of cruciferous vegetables
these vegetables are said to be protective against cancers of lungs and elementary tract
the popularity of brassica products is increasing because of their nutritional value, anticancer,
antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties
in this week we shall study in detail about definition, structure, classification, sources
and health benefits of glucosinolates
in this week we shall study phytoestrogens, phytosterols, and glucosinolates
phytoestrogens also known as dietary estrogens are naturally occurring compounds, found in
plants which have a structural similarity to the female sex hormone
phytoestrogens may be beneficial for women looking to rebalance their hormone, as they
approached menopause
various other beneficial health effects have been ascribed to phytoestrogens
such as a lowered risk of cardiovascular diseases, obesity, metabolic syndrome
hello learners, now let us conclude,
cranberries, raspberries, blackberries, and red and black grapes, and blueberries
anthocyanins inhibit the initiation, promotion and progression of several cancers
such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, and liver cancer by inhibiting several signalling pathways,
involved in tumour growth and apoptosis we have learned that lycopene is a lipid-soluble
compound, consuming it with fat increases its bioavailability
numerous studies have specified that lycopene is an active antioxidant and free radical scavenger
lycopene, because of its high number of conjugated double bonds,
exhibits higher singlet oxygen quenching ability lycopene has also shown promising results in

chapter seven is devoted to the study of or to find the solution of partial differential
equation using integral transform
this chapter is divided into five modules
i shall teach you first three modules in this week
integral transform
i shall define mainly five integral transforms
depending on the functional form of kernel, there are different types of integral transforms
now, i am going to start module four of chapter seven this module is devoted to the application of
discuss mellin transformation and its application to partial differential equation
this transformation has already been defined in module one of this chapter historically,
riemann first recognized mellin transformation in eighteen hundred seventy six in his famous
an elaborate discussion on this transformation now, we are going to slide presentation for
the explanation of this transformation
now, we shall show how mellin transformation can be used to solve the problem where we
need to find potential in an infinite which where the potential phi satisfies the laplace
equals to zero and we also have zero less than r less than infinity, and theta lies
the corresponding inverse hankel transformation is f r equals to integration zero to infinity
in this way
so, this is the infinite which and this is bounded by the line theta is equal to minus
phi tilda and the variable smaller is transformed to the variable p
now, the mellin transform of r square phi r r equals to, according to definition zero
to infinity r square phi r r into r to the power p minus one dr so, this is zero to
infinity r to the power p plus one d two phi dr square dr again we are using integration
bi parts where r to the power p plus one is taken as first function and del two phi del
r square is taken as second function so, first function into integration of second function
minus integration of derivative of first function which is p plus one into r to the power p
and integration of second function del phi del r dr
now, if we assume that del phi del r tends to zero as r tends to infinity, then the first
term becomes zero so, it becomes value of the integral becomes minus p plus one integration
function minus integration of derivative of first function that means p into r to the
power p minus one into integration of second function phi dr
equation, here we are deriving some important result now, what will be the hankel transformation
if we again assume that phi tends to zero as r tends to infinity, then the first term
gives zero and value of the integral can be written as p into p plus one integration zero
to infinity r to the power p minus one phi dr and this integral is nothing but phi tilda
find the mellin transform of r phi r, so this is nothing but integration zero to infinity
r phi r, r to the power p minus one dr so, this is zero to infinity r to the power p
d phi dr dr
in the next line we are applying integration bi parts, taking r to the power p as our first
function and d phi dr as our second function so, the value of the integral is r to the power
p into phi zero to infinity minus derivative of first function p into r to the power p
minus one to integration of second function phi dr we have already assumed that phi goes
to zero as r tends to infinity so, the first term is zero and the second term gives minus
p into phi tilda p theta, where phi tilda is the mellin transform of phi
therefore, mellin transform of r square phi r r plus r phi r plus phi theta theta is
equals to zero so, after simplification, we can write the equation in the form phi tilde theta
theta plus p square phi tilde equals to zero so, this is a second order ordinary
suppose we have the boundary conditions phi r alpha equals to f r, phi r minus alpha equals
to g r, where r goes from zero to infinity now the mellin transform of the ever boundary
presented here so, its hankel transform is equals to according to definition, integration
conditions give, the first boundary condition gives phi tilda p alpha equals to f bar p
and the second boundary condition gives phi tilda p minus alpha equals to g bar p where
so, using the condition ten and eleven, we can write that a cos p alpha plus
b sin p alpha equals to f bar and a cos p alpha minus b sin p alpha equals to g bar
and so this two are two linear equations in variables a and b so, it is easy to solve
these two equations so, solving these two equations we get the values of a and b as
follows, a equals to f bar plus g bar by two cos p alpha and b equals to f bar minus g
bar by two sin p alpha
now, substituting the values of a and b, the solution becomes phi bar equals to f bar plus
g bar by two cos p alpha into cos p theta plus f bar minus g bar by two sin p alpha into sin
p theta after simplification we can write it as equal to f bar into sin p
theta plus alpha by sin two p alpha plus g bar sin p alpha minus theta by sin two
h bar p alpha minus theta, where h bar p theta is the function which is defined as sin p
theta by sin two
of h bar p theta so value of h r theta is equals to one divided by two pi i integration
c minus i infinity to c plus i infinity r to the power minus p this is the expression
f whole multiplied with j nu xi r dr
for h bar p sin p theta by sin two p alpha into dp this is a contour integration, so
value of this contour integration can be obtained using the complex analysis
and it can be verified that its value is equals to one divided by two alpha r to the power n
sin n theta divided by one plus two r to the power n cos n theta plus r to the power two n,
where n is equals to pi divided by two alpha or two alpha equals to pi by n
bar plus g bar into h bar so, value of phi can be obtained taking inverse mellin transform
of phi bar p theta so, which is written here so, phi is equal to inverse mellin transform
of phi bar p theta
so this equals to inverse mellin transform of f bar p into h bar p alpha plus theta plus
now, i am doing the integration separately the first part, which is d two f dr square
we get phi is equal to r to the power n cos n theta by two alpha integration zero to infinity
xi to the power n minus one f xi divided by xi to the power two n minus two r xi to the
power n sin n theta plus r to the power two n d xi plus integration zero to infinity xi
to the power n minus one g xi by xi to the power two n plus two r xi to the power n sin n theta
plus r to the power two n
so, this is the part which comes for the, from the function f and this part comes from the
our required solution and we obtain this solution using mellin transformation thus,
in module four of chapter seven, we have discussed about application of hankel transformation
and mellin transformation to find solution of a partial differential equation
we have used hankel transformation to find solution of heat equation in polar coordinate system
it is also possible to find solution of wave equation in polar coordinates system using
hankel transformation the derivation is available in e text we also applied mellin transformation
to solve waves problem apart from these problems, there are many physical problems where we
can use these two transformation to find solution of a differential equation now, we end this module
two f dr square as our second function as the rest part r into j nu is taken as our
hankel transformation and mellin transformation the hankel transformation and mellin transformation
first function so, according to the rule, first function into integration of second
integration of second function df dr dr
now, if we assume that the term within the square bracket is zero for the limits r equals
to zero and r equals to infinity, then the above expression reduces to the form minus
its value is minus ddr of r j nu into f
are named according to the great mathematicians hankels and mellin respectively
so first function into integration of second function and then integration of derivative
of first function into integration of second function so, that gives the expression which
is written in the first line of this slide again we are assuming the term within the
square bracket is zero for r equals to zero and r equals to infinity so,
of r j nu into f dr
infinity is equal to, again we are assuming df dr as our second function so, first function
hankel is a german mathematician he is famous for his work in mathematical analysis, which include
j nu into integration of second function which is f over the limit zero to infinity minus
integration of derivative of first function that is ddr of j nu into integration of second
function f dr
so, if we assume that the term within the square bracket is zero, then it simplified to the form
that means the hankel transform of the equation or the expression d two f dr square plus one
of r j nu minus ddr of j nu minus nu square by r into j nu dr
hankel transformation in hankel transformation bessel function is used as the kernel
nu dr now, the expression within the square bracket for these expression we substitute
nu square by p square into j nu
that expression from this equation this is bessel differential equation of order nu
so, the value of the expression in the square bracket it is d two dp square of j nu plus
one by p ddp of j nu minus nu square by p square j nu p so from this equation the value
of this expression is minus j nu p so, substituting the value of this expression,
a large number of axisymmetric problems in cylindrical polar coordinate systems are solved
to infinity r fr j nu dr
and according to the definition of hankel transform, this is nothing but hankel transform
can be represented by the equation which you can see here del u del t equals to kuppa del
two u del r square plus one by r del u del r, where r ranges from zero to infinity and
t is the time variable which is greater than zero and we also have the initial condition
using hankel transformation now, we are going to our slide presentation the hankel transform
u r zero equals to capital u, where capital u is a constant for zero less than r less
than a and its value is zero for r greater than a
equals to minus xi square u zero bar, where u zero bar is the hankel transform of order
zero of u so here, the variable r is transformed to the variable xi
and it is easy to find the solution of this equation which is a first order ordinary differential
equation, so its solution is u zero bar is equal to a into e to the power minus xi square
of ordered nu and parameter xi of a function f r, where zero less than equals to r less
to capital u for zero less than r less than a equals to zero for r greater than a so, if you
apply hankel transform to this condition, it gives u zero xi zero equals to integration
and here we have also used the formula integration of x j zero is equal to j one now, in the
in the general solution if we put t equals to zero, we get its value left hand side is
u j one by xi and right hand side is a so it gives the value of a therefore a is equals
to u j one by xi
equals to u j one a xi by xi into e to the power minus xi square t
but, we are interested to find the variable u as function of r and t so, to get u as function
of r and t, we need to apply inverse hankel transform so, using the formula for inverse hankel
transform, we get the value of u as u equals to integration zero to infinity xi
so, this is the term, this is nothing but u zero bar so, xi u zero bar into j zero
so, this integration value of this integration will give the value of u so, this equals to
since capital u is a constant, so you can take out capital u from the integration
so, the value of the integral is capital u times zero to infinity e to the power minus xi square
in module one of chapter seven, we have defined different types of integral transform
over n u s bar sin n pi x by a
now, substituting the value of u s bar, we obtain our required solution u s two by a
multiplied with sin n pi x by a and in this solution, it is to be noted, that this f bar and g bar
are the finite sin transform of the functions f t and g t respectively so in the next line,
we are substituting the values of f bar and g bar so, substituting those values, the solution
becomes this which you can see in this slide
i have already told that hankel’s transformation is used to solve axis symmetric problem in
cylindrical polar coordinate system the finite hankel transformation is used to find temperature
distribution in a long circular pipe, where radius vector r is a finite number the method
fourier sine transform of a function fx is denoted by f bar s n is equal to integration
of finite hankel transform was first introduced by sneddon in nineteen forty six now, we are
going to the slide presentation for the derivation
i have already defined hankel transform but, here i am defining finite hankel transform
first kind, where xi i are the positive roots of the transcendental equation jnu a xi i
equals to zero the inverse finite hankel transform is defined as f r equals to two
the derivative of j nu
before applying finite hankel transform, i am deriving some important result first of all
zero to a fx sin n pi x by a into dx
i want to derive the hankel transform of the operator d two f dr square plus one
by r df dr minus nu square by r square f so according to definition, the hankel transform
of this expression is equals to zero to integration zero to a r d two f dr square plus one by
r df dr minus nu square by r square f into j nu r xi i dr
the term in the square bracket is zero so the value of the integral becomes minus integration
df dr as our second function and the dash term as our first function, we obtain the
expression which is written in the next line
r xi i, so here we are taking derivative of the term d dr of, we are expanding this term
derivative of the bessel function j nu dash r xi i into derivative of r into xi i which
now, using the condition j nu a xi i equals to zero, the value of the expression becomes
df dr j nu r xi i dr we again applying integration bi parts
we obtain the finite hankel transform of the expression d two f dr square plus one by r
so, in this using that transformation, the term in the square bracket in the last line
of the last slide, can be written in terms of p as xi square into d two dp square of j nu
plus one by p d dp of j nu minus nu mu* square by p square into j nu and the dash
terms are written in terms of the variable r now, there is an objective to transform
the bessel equation the bessel equation is d two d p square j nu plus one by p d dp
of j nu plus one minus nu mu* square by p square j nu equals to zero therefore, the
value of d two dp square j nu plus one by p d dp of j nu minus mu square by p square
j nu is equal to minus j nu
so, in this integral, we substitute the value of the expression in the square bracket as minus
the first integral, this is nothing but the finite hankel transform of the function f r
dash into f a
that you can see in equation eight and this relation holds for all nu greater than equals
to zero so in particular we can take the value of nu as zero therefore, h zero i of
shall use finite hankel transform to solve heat conduction equation
the heat conduction equation is given by in polar coordinate system is given by the equation
which is written in one del u del t equals to kappa del two u del r square plus one by
r del u del r where r varies from zero to a and the boundary condition is given u at
a t equals to zero the initial condition is u r zero equals to f r now, we want to apply
finite hankel transform, for that we first take finite hankel transform of the
given equation
so, we multiply the equation by r into j zero and then we integrate it over integration
zero to a and we obtain the equation for u zero bar which you can see in the first
here, this term becomes zero so, the equation reduces to the form which is
written in equation number ten
and this equation, in this equation u zero bar is the finite hankel transform of order
the initial condition three says that u at t equals to zero is f r so, if you take zeroth
now, the problem is now to find the solution of equation ten together with the initial
condition which is given by equation number eleven and the solution of equation ten, if
you see the equation ten, this is a first order ordinary linear differential equation
so, its solution is u zero bar equals to f zero bar into e to the power minus kappa xi
i square into t, where we have used the initial condition u zero bar at t equals to zero is
of n into cos n pi x by a
equal to f zero bar so, this is the solution of equation ten
this stage, we applying inverse finite hankel transform so, according to that formula its
value is equals to two by a square sum over i f zero bar e to the power minus kappa xi
so, if you substitute that value we get the required solution which is written in the
last line of this slide thus, in module five of chapter seven, we have applied finite sine
transform to solve heat equation and wave equation similarly, finite cosine transform
can be used to solve the same equations we have also applied finite hankel transform
now, we are considering a physical problem where we shall use finite fourier sine transformation
in the definition of those integral transform, we have taken at least one of the limits of the integral as infinite
to find solution of heat equation finite hankel transform can be used to find solution
of wave equation
the derivation is available in e-text at the end of this module, i want to mention
that finite integral transform is essential to match the theoretical outcome with the experimental results
now, we end this module
we have to solve heat conduction problem where there is a rod of finite length and the heat
distribution is given by the equation del u del t equals to kappa del two u del x square
where x varies from zero to a and t greater than zero the boundary
condition is given by u at zero t equals to ft and u at a t equals to zero
for t greater than zero and it is also given that value of f zero is zero and the initial condition
is u x zero equals to zero, for zero less than equals to x less than equals
given equation one
but in reality, there are some situation where we need to
now, if we see the left hand side of this expression we inter change the differential operator
and the integral operator in the next line so left hand side is equals to del del t
side, the value of the integral in the right hand side using integration by parts so for that,
so,
value of this integral is given by kappa sin n pi x by a into integration of second
function that is del u del x limit zero to a minus derivative of first function that
gives cos of n pi x by a into n pi by a into integration of second function is del u del
do some experiment in a box so for that case, the space variable is no more infinite
bi parts taking cos n pi x by a as our first function and del u del x as our second function
so, value of the integral becomes minus kappa n pi by a u cos n pi x by a and limit is zero
so that is u s bar equals to integration zero to a u into sin n pi x by a dx
therefore, it is relevant to consider finite integral transform thus, module five of chapter seven
and this is a first order equation so solution of this equation can be obtained easily
pi by a integration zero to t f tau e to the power minus kappa n square pi square by a
square t minus tau d tau
now, we want to get u as function of x and t so, we have to transform the variable n
is devoted to find solution of a partial differential equation using finite integral transform
kappa n square pi square by a square into t into sin n pi x pi a integration zero to
t f tau e to the power kappa n square pi square by a square into tau d tau
is given by del two u del t square equals to c square del t u del x square obviously here we have
considered a one dimensional wave equation and u satisfies the initial
conditions u at t equals to zero is f x and del del t of u at t equals to zero is g x
and we also have the boundary conditions u at x equals to zero is zero, u at x equals
to a is also zero
again we take fourier transform of the given equation, so for that we multiply the both
the entire module is divided into two sections in first section we shall discuss about the
obtain the relation which you can see in this slide in the left hand side, we interchange
the differential operator and the integral operator so, the left hand side is equals
to del two del t square of integration zero to a u sin n pi x by a into dx
so, this is nothing but u s n t now, if you evaluate the right hand side, we are applying
integration bi parts, taking del two u del x square as the second function and sin n
now, if you apply the boundary condition on x equals to zero and x equals to a, then
in this type we again apply integration bi parts taking del u del x at second function
solution using finite sine or cosine transform in second section, we shall discuss about
term becomes zero if we apply the supplied boundary condition and the second term can
be written as which is given here and the value of the integral is defined as finite
sine transform of u so, it is denoted by u s bar n t
therefore, the given equation reduces to the, to an ordinary second ordered differential equation
and its solution can be written as combination of sine function and cosine function,
the values of a n and b n, we again takes finite fourier sine transform of the initial
g x so, finite fourier transform of this initial condition gives u s n zero
equals to f s bar
the application of finite hankel transform now we are going to the slide presentation
sine transform of the function f t and g t respectively and i have already mentioned
initial conditions to the general solution four, we can immediately find the values of
so, substituting this values of a and a n and b n in equation four, we obtain the expression
of x and t, we need to apply inverse fourier transform so, in the next step, we apply inverse
in last few chapters, we have derived solution of a partial differential equation as an infinite series
value of del del n of this quantity is one by epsilon square, and d sigma
is epsilon square sin theta d theta d phi
take out the term u r from the integration so, this is u r integration of sin theta
d theta d phi, over this surface sigma plus order of epsilon term and after integration
we obtain its value is four pi therefore, value of the integral u del del n of u dash
is equals to four pi u r plus term of order of epsilon
the values of all term, del u del n becomes del u del n plus order of epsilon and value
shall discuss some properties of green’s function in addition, we shall derive green’s
of one by mod r minus xi is one by epsilon and value of d sigma is epsilon square sin
theta d theta d phi
so, after simplification you can see that this values of this integral is of order epsilon
u into del del n of one by mod r minus xi ds
so, from this expression, and we obtained this expression considering epsilon tends to zero
so, from this expression, you can see that, the value of u can be obtained at an arbitrary
function for laplace equation in module two, we shall discuss about the green’s function
which is written in equation number fifteen and to find value of u at p, we need to know
we can find u at a arbitrary point p
similarly, in case of exterior dirichlet problem, we can obtain a relation which is
normal derivative on the surface s but, let us try to think the problem in some different way
now, we consider a function which is known as green’s function, which is of the form
and we also assume that the function capital h is harmonic that means, h will satisfy
the laplace equation, which is written here del two del xi square plus del two del eta square
for solving heat equation and wave equation
plus del two to del zeta square operating on h equals to zero on v and we also assume
that the function g is such that the value of g is equals to zero on the surface s
so, if g satisfies this condition, the function g is called green’s function
of u at r can be written in the form, which you can see in equation number eighteen now,
in equation sixteen and seventeen and it is also given that g is zero on s so, if we use
that condition, equation eighteen reduces to the form equation nineteen
integral of u del g del n ds
now, we are going to the first slide show of module one before going to the discussion
hence, the solution of dirichlet problem is reduces to that of determination of green’s
function capital g so, in this form in this solution, we don't need to know the value
of normal derivative of u in the surface s
so, this is the advantage of finding solution in terms of green’s function now, i am
going to discuss some properties of green's function it has one important property that
green’s function g which is function of two variable the vector r and vector xi it
is symmetric about these two variables
equal to h plus one divided by mod r minus xi where h is a harmonic in v therefore,
on green’s function, i am first defining our spatial function which is called direct
as you can see in this figure, we have taken two points, two different points p one and
p two, having position vectors r one, r two respectively within the region capital v and
s is the boundary of the region capital v
we assume u one as g at r one xi is equal to h at r one xi plus one divided by mod r
s and nabla square of g at r one xi is equal to minus four pi delta r one minus
now, this is our famous green's theorem which convert the volume integral to the surface
delta function the direct delta function which is denoted by delta x minus xi, y minus
are substituted in the next step
and if you see the right-hand side, that means, the surface integral which you can see in
this slide, is value is zero on s because, by assumption g r one xi is equal to zero
delta r one minus xi dv equals to zero
now, this integral can be separated so, the first integral value of the first integral
is g r one r two and the value of the second integral is g r two r one and, this value
eta, equals to zero for x not equals to xi and y not equals to eta, into this is direct
can be obtained using the property of delta function therefore, these equation gives
g r one, r two is equal to g r two r one so, this says that the function g is symmetric
with respect to the argument r one and r two
the green's function g be continuous, and its normal derivative del g del n be discontinuous
equal to one now we know the property of green's function as nabla square g is equal
to delta r minus xi
nabla square g dv equals to one now, if you take the limit epsilon tends
delta function in two variables
to zero, then its value will remain same volume integral of nabla square g d v equals to one
now, this volume integral can be converted to the surface integral using the divergence
theorem so, it gives that limit epsilon tends to zero surface integral of del g del n
thus, in module one of chapter eight, we have learned how to find solution of a non-homogeneous
partial differential equation using green's function we have also taken a homogeneous
equation for example, we took laplace equation to find its solution using green's function
there are many linear differential equations, which can be solved using green’s function method
thus, we end this module
where r epsilon is the region x minus xi whole square plus y minus eta whole square is less than
it is also possible to find solution of a partial differential equation as integral
third property which is very important, we shall use this property to find solution of a pde
x minus xi y minus eta dx d y is equal to f xi, eta for arbitrary continuous function
f in the region capital r the delta function is a symbolic function and is often viewed
eta dx dy is equal to f xi eta
and if we see the result three and four, we can conclude that delta x minus xi into y
superposition in terms of an auxiliary function which is known as green’s function
have shown that direct delta function in dimension two can be written as product of direct delta
function in one dimension now, these results can be generalized if x is n dimensional
that delta x vector minus xi vector is equals to delta x one minus xi one, delta x two minus
xi two into dot dot delta x n and minus xi n
suppose, we have a non-homogeneous partial differential equation, which is written in
equation number seven lu x equals to a f x, where capital x has components x y, z,
and l is an arbitrary linear partial differential operator and f x is some known function
and we want to find the value of u x for which equation seven is satisfied now, we shall
show how can we introduce the concept of green’s function to find solution of seven
the advantage of taking integral solution of a partial differential equations are as follows
of delta function
now, if we see the left-hand side of this relation l is an operator, which is operated
on function of capital x only so, we can interchange the operator l and the integral
operator in equation nine so, the left-hand side of equation nine become l operating on
firstly, the integral representation helps us to visualize the analytical structure of the solution,
square bracket can be assumed as our u x or our required solution
therefore, solution of the given equation, which is written in equation number seven
the green’s function, and it's play the role of a kernel in this integration
using green’s function in the last section, we have discussed how to find solution of
a non-homogeneous partial differential equation using green’s function, but it is also possible
to find solution of a homogeneous equation using green’s function in the present section,
we are going to derive green’s function solution of laplace equation
now, we are going to our slide presentation first, we are considering an
which may be obscured in an infinite series solution secondly, it
interior dirichlet problem suppose, the values of u and del u by del n where del u del n represents the
normal derivative of u are known at every point on the boundary s of some finite region
capital v and it is also given that u satisfies the laplace equation nabla squared u equals
to find the value of u at the point capital p, that is u at p for that purpose, we surround
here, o is the position of origin and p is the point inside v and op is the vector small
is sometimes easy to evaluate the integral compared to find the sum of an infinite series
the region v minus sigma and s dash be the boundary of the region v dash
order derivatives on the surface s, then using green’s theorem, we can write that volume
integral of u nabla square u dash minus u dash nabla square u is equals to surface integral
u is equal to nabla square u dash is equal to zero within v minus sigma therefore, left
thus, chapter eight is devoted to the study of green’s function
eleven, this s dash is nothing but union of surface s and small sigma
so, these surface integrals can be written as integration over s, u del u dash del n
minus you dash del u del n d s plus surface integral over sigma of the same quantity is
next step, we substituted the value of u dash so, the integral becomes surface integral
using green’s function, we shall find solution of a partial differential equation the entire
as d sigma equals to r epsilon square sin theta d theta d phi
if we substitute the values of x y z here, it takes the form which you can see here
now, think about this integral surface integral on sigma u del del n of one by mod r minus
chapter is divided into two modules in module one, we shall define green’s function, we
in module one, we have defined green's function we have also obtained green's function solution
minus theta so, it is written here so, g equals to half of
so, if we use the expression for pq here, and we have already obtained the expression
for p dash q in the previous slide here you can get the expression for p dash q and here
we obtain the expression for p q so, if we substitute those values here, the expression
for g becomes half ln a square plus r square xi square by a square minus two r xi cos phi
minus theta divided by r square plus xi square minus two r xi cos phi minus theta
boundary is a circle so, outward <?></?> normal is in the direction of xi so, del del n is
equivalent to del del xi so, del g del n at xi equals to a is equal to del del xi of
g at xi equals to a and it can be computed from the derived expression from of g and
u equals to some known function f, which is function of y, z on the boundary x equals
its value becomes r square minus a square divided by a into a square minus two ar cos
phi minus theta plus r square
the expression for del g del n on the circle xi equals to a so, you substitute that expression
here and we have to substitute the value of u on the surface bounding surface that means,
we have to substitute the value of u on the circle
so, if that is given as small f, then u at r theta can be written as s square minus r
square by two pi a integration zero to two pi f phi d phi by s square minus two a r cos
to zero and we also have the bounded solution that means, u tends to zero as x tends to
phi minus theta plus r square in this section, we shall solve wave equation using green’s
function first of all, we shall prove helmholtz theorem then we shall solve space form of
wave equation using appropriate green’s function now, for derivation we have to go to the slide presentation
partial_differential_equations_971
continuous partial derivatives of first and second order in a region v which is bounded
by the closed surface s and these u satisfies the helmholtz equation nabla square plus c
square operating on u equals to zero then surface integral of one by four pi exponential
infinity now, we want to solve this problem using the method of green's function
region v and the value of this expression is zero if r is outside the region v
first, we shall prove this theorem let u r be the solution of the helmholtz equation,
which is written here nabla square u plus c squared equals to zero and we also assume
that all singularities of u lies outside the region v and we take the expression for u
dash as e to the power i c mod r minus xi divided by mod r minus xi now, this is famous
green's theorem now, in this theorem, we substitute this particular expression for u dash
square u is equal to it becomes volume integral v, so here we are substituting the expression
so, in this method, we need to construct a function g, which is known as green's function,
these two function cancel out, and the value of the volume integral becomes zero
so, if we go back to equation five, the left-hand side becomes zero and the right hand side
is surface integral of u del del n of e to the power i c mod r minus xi by mod r minus
xi, minus e to the power i c mod minus xi by mod minus xi into del u del n now, if
is denoted by capital sigma and the surface of the sphere is denoted by small sigma then
we can apply the green’s theorem in the region d minus sigma
so, the left-hand side of that theorem will become zero for the region so, if we call
back equation five, the left hand side will be zero for the region v minus sigma and the
right hand side will be the surface integral over the surface, which is the boundary of
v minus sigma that means these surface integral is to be evaluated in the surface s union small sigma
del n of this minus u dash del u del n is equal to zero now, for this case on sigma,
is equal to n is the outward <?><?> normal
to the surface sigma so, for this case it is del del epsilon so, if we compute these,
its value is ic minus one by epsilon into e to the power i c epsilon by epsilon
by mod r minus xi, number two, the function h is such that, it is harmonic in xi space
finally, i c minus one by mod r minus xi into e to the power ic mod r minus xi by mod r
equals to minus of surface integral over sigma ic minus one by mod r minus xi u minus del
u del n of u dash
now, we want to simply simplify the expression in the right-hand side of equation seven
now on sigma u xi is, is equal to u r plus order of epsilon term and del u del n at the point
xi equals to del u del n at the point r plus order of epsilon terms and on sigma we can write
elementary surface as ds is equal to epsilon square sin theta d theta d phi see
if we substitute these, in this expression in the right hand side of equation seven,
therefore, del two del xi square plus del two del eta square plus del two del zeta square,
it becomes which you can see in this slide, surface integral over sigma ic minus one by
mod r minus xi, ur plus order of epsilon minus del u del n at the point p or r minus one
by epsilon into the u dash term into d s, this is, epsilon squared sine theta d theta d phi
first, we have to, we want to take the zeroth order of the term, then the order of epsilon terms
so, after simplification from this term, you can see that the zeroth order term is integration
over sigma u sin theta d theta d phi and the rest terms are of order of epsilon
therefore, it can be written as again on sigma, we know the value of theta and phi theta varies from
zero to pi, phi varies from zero to two pi
so, after integration it becomes minus four pi and the rest of the terms are of order
operating on h must be equal to zero
epsilon so, if you take epsilon tends to zero, then we can establish, we can get the
left-hand side of the integration in this term, the left-hand side is the surface integral
over s and the right-hand side we just obtained its value is minus four pi u plus order of
epsilon term so, if we equate this two term and taking epsilon tends to zero limit, we
its value is zero
for helmholtz equation so, for that, the function g has to satisfy the following conditions,
it will satisfy the helmholtz equation which is written in one and also g is a finite and
continuous with respect to both the variables r and xi so, we can replace the exponential
and there is third condition on green's function, which is, the value of the green’s function
term by g in equation eight so, if you observe equation eight we are replacing this term by g
so, the expression becomes u r equals to one by four pi surface integral of g del
u del n minus u del g del n ds
so, in this equation you can observe that to find the value of u, we need to find the
value of both u and its normal derivative on the surface but to minimize that condition,
we choose green's function so, in the green’s function we choose g in such a way that the
value of g is equal to zero on the surface therefore, the above equation reduces to the
choice of g we obtain that g will satisfy the helmholtz equation, g is a finite and
continuous with respect to the variables r and xi and g is equal to zero on the surface
g is equal to zero on the boundary and for this case the boundary is x equals to zero
of laplace equation in module two of chapter eight, we shall derive the particular expression
s therefore, g is the appropriate green’s function for the helmholtz equation
now, we want to find the particular expression for green’s function for this particular
equation is valid in the half-space z greater than equals to zero we want to solve this
problem choosing appropriate green's function
is our region where we want to find the green’s function, z greater equals to zero, p is a
particular point in this space
and p dash is the image of p with respect to the plane z equals to zero so, if p has
cartesian coordinates x y z, then p dash must have but cartesian coordinates x y minus z
and, we also assume q is a variable point in that space in the space z greater than
equals to zero
and xi vector is equal to xi eta zeta and you can verify that if q lies on the plane
z equals to zero, then mod of rho minus xi is equal to mod of r minus xi and the expression
for g, which in this case, we are assuming in the form e to the power ic mod r minus
xi divided by mod r minus xi minus e to the power ic mod rho minus xi divided by mod rho
minus xi where, rho is the image of r with respect to the plane z equals to zero
so, under boundary z equals to zero, mod of rho minus xi equals to mod of r minus xi
del g del n is equals to delta g minus del g del xi on del g del zeta on zeta equals
to zero and we can obtain the expression for mod r minus xi, which is in terms of cartesian coordinates
it's written here and we can also find the value of mod rho minus zeta
square
and we can obtain the value of minus del g del zeta, at zeta equals to zero it can be
calculated it's very easy to compute so, we can compute that and after simplification,
you can get the value of this expression as two into del del z of e to the power ic r
eta square plus z square
in the space and xi has the component, xi eta zeta, and which is the point q
from here, you obtain that from equation nine here we have substituted the
value of del g del n and, here we have also used the value of u on the surface s, which is
f for this problem so, this is our required
solution thus, in module two of chapter eight, we have derived the expression of green's function
for laplace equation in two different geometries those are half-space and in a circle we have
also derived the green’s function solution of wave equation we also derived the expression
of green’s function for heat equation in half-space apart from that, it is also possible
to find the expression of green’s function or the green’s function solution of heat equation
now, we want to find the value or the expression for green's function using the method of image
the derivation is available in e-text it is to be noted that the expression for
green's function depends on the equation and boundary condition and also the geometry of the problem
now, we end this module
for that, we consider a point p dash having position vector rho be such that, it is image
of the point p about the plane x equals to zero so, if we see the figure corresponding
figure so, this is xyz plane, and the boundary of the space is x equals to zero
and the laplacian equation is defined in the space, where x is greater than equals to zero
so, in the space x greater than equals to zero p is a peaks point having position vectors
small r and q is a variable point in that space having position vector xi and we have
for green's function, to solve dirichlet problems in half space and in a circle in addition
considered p dash with position vector rho such that p dash is the image of the point
p about a plane x equals to zero
now with this choice of p dash, we choose the expression for the function capital
h as capital h is equals to minus one divided by mod rho minus xi so, if we choose this condition,
the expression for capital g becomes capital g is equals to minus one by mod rho
minus xi plus one by mod r minus xi now, with this particular choice of capital h,
the value of capital g becomes zero on x equals to zero, because the value of mod rho minus
xi is equals to the value of mod r minus xi on the plane x equals to zero in addition
to that, this expression for capital h will satisfy the laplacian equation, which is given
by condition number two in this slide that means, nabla square h is equals to zero for
to laplace problem, we shall also derive green's function solution of wave equation
this particular choice of capital h
therefore, we can take the expression for green's function for this particular problem
have obtained the expression for green's function to find the value of u or the solution of
laplace equation in terms of green's function can be written as u r equals to minus one
the direction of the normal is outward direction to the surface s
so, for this case the surface is x equals to zero therefore, del del n is nothing but
minus del del xi so, the value of the integration becomes one by four pi integration minus infinity
first, we shall derive the expression for green’s function of laplace equation in
to plus infinity, integration minus infinity to plus infinity f del del xi of, this is
plus y minus eta square plus z minus zeta square these represent the quantity
one by mod rho minus xi d eta d zeta
that we have to find the value of del g del n on the surface s that means in the last
line we have to find the derivative of del del zeta of the expression which is written
in curly bracket on the surface x equals to zero means, it is to be computed at the value
or at the point xi equals to zero
half space for the derivation, we are going to the slide presentation to describe the
so, after simplification the expression for u becomes u equals to x by two pi double integration
three by two which is given by equation number one thus, we can obtain the solution of laplace
equation in half space using the concept of green's function
solution of dirichlet problem that means, the value of the unknown function u is given
in the circle so, if we see this figure, p is a fixed point inside the circle having
so, these are the polar coordinates of the two points and p dash, now we choose a point
dirichlet problem in a half space, we considered the half space x greater equals to zero, where
op into op dash equals to a square so, this is definition of inverse point of a point
with respect to a circle therefore, from this definition, we can find the polar coordinates
of p dash as a square by r theta now,
we construct green's function for this particular problem as g equal to h plus log
we have to go back to the figure so, from this figure, you can see the value of p dash
q square is equal to oq square plus op square minus oq into op into cos of
angle between op and oq, which is for this case is phi minus theta
x varies from zero to infinity, y and z lies between minus infinity to plus infinity
so, we have written that expression here, p dash q square is equal to this now, if
we put the values of oq, which is xi square and o p dash is a to the power four pi r square
r square p dash q square is, so we multiply the expression by r square so, it becomes
xi square r square plus a to the power four minus two xi r a square cos phi minus theta
then we divide the expression by a square so, we get the value of r square p dash q
square by r square as xi square r square by a square plus a square minus two xi r cos
phi minus theta
now, if we take the square root of that expression and we obtain the expression for capital h
as capital h is equal to half of log xi square r square by a square, plus a square minus
so, in this problem we have to find the value of the unknown function u, where u satisfies
that nabla square of h is equal to zero and with this choice of h, the expression for
that means for r equals to a, the expression for g becomes g equals to log of r, for r
equals to a the p dash q becomes pq
so, those two factors cancel out and factor within the log becomes one that means the
value of g becomes zero on r equals to a therefore, with this choice of g it satisfies
value or the expression for pq so, for that we use the geometry so, value of pq square
the laplacian equation nabla square u equals to zero, where x greater equals to zero and
now, i am going to start chapter nine this chapter consist of only one module and this
and tau is function of t only
function phi and function tau and if we assume minus lambda as separation constant, we obtain
the equation for phi as the helmholtz equation which is given in equation ten and the equation
corresponding eigenfunction therefore, laplace square phi n plus lambda n phi n equals to
so, let us consider the equation laplace square plus lambda u equals to zero in some region capital
equal to zero for m not equals to n, which is given by equation thirteen
combination of the eigenfunction of the laplacian operator so, u is represented as sum over
that means to equation seven, we obtain a relation which you can see in equation fifteen
left hand side is sum over n cn double dot plus omega n square cn into double integration
r with the boundary condition u equals to zero on c, where c is the boundary of the
now, these are the eigenfunction and we know that these eigenfunctions from orthogonal
set, so using that orthogonality property this reduces to phi cn,
where norm of phi n square is the double integration over r mod of phi n square dx dy
condition, the initial condition is given in equation eight, where value of u at time
t is equal to zero is f and del u del t at time t equals to zero is g so, if we use
region capital r
n equals to f and sum over n cn dot zero phi n equals to g
now, in the first expression you can see that this is the eigenfunction expansion of the
function small f now, using the orthogonality property of eigenfunction phi n, we can find
over the region capital r similarly, using the orthogonality property of eigenfunctions,
we can derive the values of cn dot at zero is equal to one by norm phi n square double
now, if we look back the equation sixteen, so this is a second order ordinary differential
equation now, to find the solution of this equation, we need two initial conditions
so, those two initial conditions are given by equation eighteen one is the value of
now, in this equation you can see that u is equal zero is a solution of this system
cn zero and the another one is the value cn dot zero
omega n t minus xi d xi here, we obtain this solution using the method of variation of
parameters in this method, we first write the solution cn t in the form an cos omega
n t plus bn sin omega n t, then we vary the parameter an and bn, that means assuming an,
bn as function of t we then derive the solution in this form
the initial conditions that means using the values of cn at time t equals to zero and
cn, ddt of cn at time t equals to zero so using those two initial condition, it is easy to
and that solution is a trivial solution of the given equation now, apart from trivial solution,
and in this equation, all the quantities are known an, bn they are given by these two
is given by equation seventeen and we also know the eigenfunction phi n so, this is
the eigenfunction solution of two dimensional non-homogeneous wave equation we have already
defined eigenvalue and eigenfunction of a laplacian operator we have also shown how
to find solution of a partial differential equation in terms of eigenfunction
now, in this section, we are going to derive how to find solution of poisson equation using eigenfunction
there may exist some non trivial solution u of the above system for some particular
and green's function now, we are going to slide presentation
suppose we are going to solve two dimensional poisson’s equation, which is given by laplace
square u equals to f together with the boundary condition u equals to zero on the boundary
c of the region capital r and we want to solve this problem using eigenfunction and
green's function if capital g is the green's function of this problem, then it will satisfy
laplace square g equals to delta function of x minus xi, y minus eta, where x, y belong
then laplace square plus lambda into phi equals to zero in r and phi is equals to zero on
c let lambda mn are the eigenvalues and phi mn are the corresponding eigenfunctions
values of lambda and those particular values of lambda are called eigenvalues of the operator
and we also assume that the green's function of this problem can be written as linear combination
of xi and eta into phi mn
values of b mn so, the values of b mn can be written as b mn equals to one divided by
the property of <?>direct</?> delta function, the value of the integral is phi mn xi, eta
laplace square in the region capital r and the solution u corresponding to a particular
and we know that lambda mn are the eigenvalues of the operator laplace square and phi mn
mn are the eigenvalues of the laplacian operator and phi mn are the corresponding eigenfunction
therefore, the equation twenty four holds now,
eta, from this expression we substitute the values of g and delta in terms of the eigenfunction
laplace square of this is the expression for capital g and this is the expression for,
right hand side is the expression for direct delta function in two variables
value of lambda is called the eigenfunction
now, if we interchange the summation and the laplacian operator, then this laplacian is
mn phi mn so, we substituted that value here so, in the last line we obtain minus lambda
mn sum over m, sum over n a mn into phi mn equals to, in the right hand side we substituted
the values of b mn, which we obtained in the previous slide
so, these are the values of b mn so, b mn equals to phi mn by norm of phi mn
the orthogonality property, we can find the value of a mn as minus phi mn by lambda mn
into norm of phi mn square thus we can find the eigenfunction expansion of the green's
module is devoted to find eigenfunction solution of a partial differential equation the chapter
therefore, for this particular problem, we can obtain the value of green's function in
terms of eigenfunction of the laplacian operator and in chapter eight, we learned how to find
solution of a non-homogeneous equation in terms of green's function there we learned
here, we use double integration because we are solving two dimensional poisson equation
if it is three dimensional problem, then instead of double integration, it would have been
a triple integration so, value of u can be obtained using formula twenty seven,
thus in chapter nine, we solved a partial differential equation using eigenfunction
method we mainly defined eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a laplacian operator using
similarly, one can define neumann eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, when
the eigenfunctions of laplacian operator, we solved laplace equation,
poisson equation and wave equation in the similar way, one can define eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
different operator to solve different type of partial differential equation
now, we end this module
instead of u, if the normal derivative of u is prescribed on the boundary c of the region capital r
a partial differential equation for that purpose, we are considering the helmholtz
equation in two d so, in this problem, we have to solve the equation del two del x square
plus del two del y square plus lambda u equals to zero in some region capital r
for this particular problem, we have considered capital r as a rectangle of sides a and b
zero, y equals to zero, u a, y equals to zero for zero less than equals to y less than equals
to b and u x, zero equals to u x, b equals to zero for zero less than equals to x less
is divided into three sections in the first section, i shall define eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
than equals to a
first, we are solving this problem using the method of separation of variables so, for
that we write u as product of x and y where capital x, capital y are functions of small
x and small y respectively substituting this expression for u in the helmholtz equation,
double dash plus mu square x equals to zero and y double dash plus nu square y equals
to zero, where x double dash and y double dash represent the second order derivative
of capital x and capital y with respect to small x and small y respectively
and if we apply the boundary conditions, it gives the value of capital x at zero and a
is equal to zero and value of capital y at zero and b is equal to zero and there is
of a laplacian operator in the same section, we shall develop the concept of eigenfunction
a relation between lambda and the separation constant mu square and nu square, which is
given by lambda equals to mu square plus nu square and the solution of x equation can
to n pi by b, where m and n are integers
n, that’s why we use the suffix mn so, lambda mn equals to pi square into m square
by a square plus n square by b square and the solution or the eigenfunction is defined
n are integers one, two, dot, dot
taking one example where we shall solve helmholtz equation
positive numbers and they form a countable set of real numbers, accumulating only at
infinity and it is to be noted that the smallest eigenvalue which is denoted by lambda one
one, which corresponds to m equals to one and n equal to one, it has the eigenfunction
eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue lambda one one but for other values of lambda,
it is possible that it may corresponds to more than one choice of m and n
to ab by four if m equals to m dash, n equals to n dash and its value is zero if m not equals
m dash, n not equals to n dash that means the state of function u mn are orthogonal
in the second section of this module, we shall find eigenfunction solution of a non-homogeneous
the value of the constant a mn can be obtained using the orthogonality property of the sine
series
thus, the fourier series five may be considered as an expansion in eigenfunctions of two
so, in this way we can represent a function f x, y in terms of the eigenfunction of the
operator which is given here or in terms of the laplacian operator
now, we want to generalize the concept of eigenvalues <?>of</?> eigenfunction the general
wave equation lastly, in section three, we shall find the solution of non-homogeneous
this is equation one so, the general eigenvalue problem can be studied in many different ways
one of them is the use of green's function, where the solution can be written in the form
the properties of green's operator, we can obtain the values of lambda and the
corresponding eigenfunction u there are another method using which we can obtain the eigenvalues
and eigenfunction of the given laplacian operator the collection of all eigenvalues lambda n
is called the spectrum of the laplacian laplace square and the subject where we study
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an operator is known as spectral theory and this is important
branch of mathematics
laplace equation or poisson equation now, we are going to the first slide of this module
in this section, we shall solve two dimensional non-homogeneous wave equation first, we shall
solve homogeneous wave equation with the help of eigenfunction then we shall try to write
the solution of non-homogeneous equation in terms of those eigenfunctions using the method
of variation of parameters now, we are going to the slide presentation
del two u del t square minus c square into del two u del x square plus del two u del
y square equals to capital f x, y, t and we have the initial conditions, u x, y at
time t equals to zero is equal to f x, y and also del u del t at time t equals to zero
is given by the function g x, y we also have the boundary conditions b u equals to zero
on the boundary c of the region capital r
we have the idea of eigenvalue and eigenfunction of a matrix now, i am going to define eigenvalue
for that case u equal to zero on c, if it is a neumann condition, then the
normal derivative of u that is del u del n equals to zero on c, or it may be mixed type
boundary condition or in other words robin condition for which u plus del u del n equals
to zero on c
wave equation, where we have considered the right hand side of equation seven, which is
of separation of variables first we separate the space variable from time variable so,
we assume u as product of phi and tau, where phi is function of space variable x and y
and eigenfunction of an operator here, we are taking the laplacian operator
in last few chapters, we have discussed about linear, elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic equations
divided by one plus t f dash xi, where capital f is c of small f
one plus t f dash xi is not equals to zero and also it is to be noted that the solution
now,
using the previous result, we can arrive to a theorem which is stated here in the slide
the non-linear initial value problem del u del t plus c u del u del x equals to zero,
four, is devoted to the study of burger's equation finally, in module five, we shall
it will reduce to the linear wave equation four and the solution of this curve or the characteristic curves
xi equals to x minus ct, therefore u is equal to f of x minus ct
physical interpretation of solution is always important because it helps us to visualize
a particular phenomena in this section, we shall give geometrical interpretation of the
solution which we have obtained in the last section now, we shall show, that how solution
represent a shock wave now, this is the time to go the slide presentation
first of all, we assume that c dash t u is function such that it is positive and we
discuss about non-linear schrodinger’s equation and solitons now, we are going to the first
know that, the graph of u at time t is equal to zero is the same as that of the function
and the distance moved depends on xi but here i want to mention that, in this case,
the point which have the lower value of u
there will be a distortion of the wave or the structure or the shape of the wave and
slide of module one
that will result a shock wave and this is due to the non-linear character of the equation
quantity del u del x and del u del t becomes infinite
before going to the discussion on non-linear wave equation, let me start with the linear
x equals to xi plus t f xi and this characteristic also persist through
it cannot be a negative quantity therefore, f dash xi must be a negative quantity
so, if we assume that c dash f is greater than zero, then small f dash xi must be less
will cease to exist for all time, if the initial data is such that f dash xi
is less than zero for some value of xi
wave equation in one dimension the wave equation in one dimension is given by del two u del
the first singularity develops, the value of f dash xi must be numerically largest
since, f dash xi is a negative number, we have to find the minimum of f dash xi for
xi minus infinity to plus infinity
so, for first singularity, tau is equals to minus one divided by minimum of c dash f into
f dash xi, where xi varies from minus infinity to plus infinity of course, this tau must
be greater than zero because this represent a particular time if the graphs of non-linear
t square equals to c square del two u del x square, where t is the time variable and
so here, this is our x axis, this is u axis and this is time axis so, at time t equals
the points will move faster than the points which have the lower value of u
solution will not exist and this particular phenomena is known as shock waves and this
is the characteristic of a non-linear differential equation so, in this wave, we can show that
how shock waves generates or how can we get shock wave solution from a non-linear first order
differential equation or rather we can say from a wave equation
thus, in module one of chapter ten, we have introduced simplest first order wave equation
x is the space variable
we have also introduced non-linear first order wave equation the solution of first order
wave equation is a shock wave which is completely a non-linear phenomena thus, we end this module
and solution of this equation can be written easily the general solution of equation one
the function representing phi denotes a wave which is propagating in the positive direction
however, in nature there are many phenomena such as shock waves, soliton waves,
of x axis, where the function psi denotes the equation of a wave which is propagating
in the negative direction of x axis
c into del del x operating on u equals to zero so, the simplest linear wave equation
can be written as del u del t plus c into del u del x equals to zero
and the solution of this equation is u equals to phi x minus ct, where this represent a
wave moving with the constant velocity c in the positive direction of x axis without change
of shape so, in this way, one can represent wave equation which is of first order and
linear, which is given in equation number four
pattern formations, etcetera cannot be explained in terms of linear differential equation
in our last slide, we got introduced with the linear first order wave equation
in the coming slide, we shall discuss about the non-linear first order wave equation and using that equation,
we shall generate the concept of shock waves this type of particular equation arises to
explain non-linear wave equation when the effect of dissipations are neglected
now, we are going to the slide presentation
x equals to zero in the earlier slide, c was a constant, but for this case, c is now
is function of u therefore, equation five is a non-linear equation and we have also
the initial condition u at time t is equal to zero is equal to f x, for minus infinity
therefore it is important to study non-linear partial differential equation in this regard,
the initial condition six
the linear differential equation, the principle of superposition cannot be applied to solve
this non-linear equation number two, the entire nature of the solution can be changed
due to non-linearity
and study of the above initial-value problem reveals some important ideas for non-linear
parabolic waves, which cannot be observed in case of linear equation and a large number
of physical and engineering problems can be dealt with the above non-linear system or
its extension therefore, the study of the above equation, that means equation five together
with the initial condition six is important
i want to mention that finding solution of a non-linear differential equation is not
now, we shall use the method of characteristic to find the solution of equation four
now, we consider the total differential of u which is du since u is function of t and x, so
it lies on a curve gamma whose slope at any point p is given by dx
del u del x
which is given in equation number five so, the solution of equation five is equivalent
easy because in this case, the principle of superposition does not hold therefore, chapter
and dx dt equals to the slope of any member of the curve on gamma, therefore dx dt equals to c u represent the slope
curves of the equation five thus the solution of the partial differential equation five
is equivalent to solving two simultaneous ordinary differential equations seven and eight
but if we observe equation seven, we can find solution of this equation as u is equal to
eight then we can solve equation eight as x equals to c u t plus another constant
the general solution of equation five depends on finding the family of lines, each line
ten is devoted to the study of non-linear partial differential equation
so, if xi be the initial point on the characteristic curve gamma and if one of these curves gamma
intersect t equals to zero at x equals to xi, then u xi, zero equals to f xi on the
whole of that curve gamma that you can see in this figure so, at time t equals to zero,
x equals to xi and at the same point, the value of u is f xi in this figure, you can
see one characteristic which is denoted by gamma
simultaneous ordinary equation as dx dt equals to c u, where value of x at the point zero
or time t equals to zero is xi and du dt equals to zero, where u at time t equals to
we divide the entire chapter into five modules in module one, we shall discuss about non-linear
zero is f xi
that in this equation, dx dt equals to f xi and if we solve this equation together with
the solution of ten can be written as small x equals to t f xi plus xi
now, this represent the characteristic curve which is a straight line whose slope is not
constant but depends on xi and this is the characteristic of non-linear, solution of
a non-linear differential equation in case of linear differential equation, it would
have been constant therefore, the solution of the initial value problem in parametric
form can be represented as u is equal to f xi and x equals to xi plus t f xi, where capital
one dimensional wave equation in module two, we shall discuss about the phenomena of dispersion
now,
to verify this, we take differentiation, take derivative of u with respect to both
x and t we get del u del x equals to f dash xi into del xi del x and differentiation with
respect t gives del u del t equals to f dash xi into del xi del t and the second equation
we again take differentiation with respect to x and t separately so, it gives, one equals
dash xi into del xi del t
to f dash xi divided by one plus t capital f dash xi and if you eliminate del xi del
and dissipation module three, deals with the discussion on kdv equation and module
now, i am going to start module two of chapter ten this module is devoted to the discussion
square minus alpha plus beta by four del u del xi plus alpha minus beta by four del u
del eta minus gamma by four u equals to zero
e to the power alpha plus beta by four into eta minus alpha minus beta by four into xi
lambda is equal to alpha square minus beta square minus four gamma divided by four
now, if we come back to the original co-ordinate system x and t, our required solution is u
is equal to w into e to the power beta by two into x minus alpha by two into t, where
is a constant these type of waves are called non-dispersive waves
partial_differential_equations_1586
zero but if alpha greater than zero then, the energy will dissipate
integration del u del t square plus del u del x square plus gamma u square dx
now, if you take the time derivative of the energy, so here we have taken the derivative of u,
so right hand side is del u del t del two u del t square plus del u del x del two u
del x del t plus gamma u del u del t
now, we take common the term del u del t from first and third term, so that gives del u
del t into del two u del t square plus gamma u plus del u del t into del two u del x del t
so, for non-dispersive wave, phase velocity c is constant for dispersive wave, c is equal
in the third line, we substituted the value of del two u del t square plus gamma u from
the given equation
then after some simplification, we obtain the last line, where the value of de dt is
equals to minus alpha integration del u del t whole square dx the value of the integral
del u del t whole square dx is a positive quantity and we have assumed that alpha is
a positive number
so, the equation says that de dt is less than zero, less than or equals to zero for alpha
greater than zero that means, the energy will decrease with time or in other words
energy will dissipate and this dissipation, for this dissipation, the term alpha is responsible
therefore, in the equation, if we go back to the original equation or equation number
to some function of wave number k now, what is the difference between a dispersive wave
nine, so in this equation the term alpha represent the dissipation of energy
at the beginning of this module, we have started with a linear one dimensional wave equation
and from that equation, we discussed the phenomena of dispersion and dissipation we also relate
the terms which are responsible for dispersion and dissipation
now, i am going to discuss the domain of dependence of the solution of general wave equation
we consider the cauchy problem of non-homogeneous wave equation so, the problem is given by
del two u del t square minus del two u del x square equals to f x, t since f is present,
the equation is called non-homogeneous and this is the cauchy type problem, that means
the values of u and its time derivative del u del t are prescribed at initial time, that
and a non-dispersive wave? suppose there is a non-sinusoidal disturbance and we know that
and we have already derived the solution of this type of equation and the solution is
given by u at p, p is a fixed point in x-t plane and which has co-ordinates x and t,
we want to find the value of u at the point p
so h is prescribed along the interval q to r and value of the integral f over the region
by the lines pq, qr and rp
this type of disturbance can be written as combination of sinusoidal waves now, for
this domain and this domain is called the domain of dependence it is to be noted that,
the domain d
where the characteristic through p intersect the x axis and d is the domain bounded by
this characteristic and x axis the closure d bar is the domain of dependence of inhomogeneous
wave equation
our equation nine so, if we compare this equation with the inhomogeneous wave equation,
non-dispersive wave, since the velocity of all waves having different wave numbers are
for that we need to take the term alpha del u del t plus beta del u del x plus gamma into
u to the right hand side of this equation
so, if we compare equation nine with the inhomogeneous equation, we can write in this form del two
u del t square minus del two u del x square equals to some function capital f, which is
minus alpha del u del x minus beta del u del t minus gamma u so, this is the expression
for capital f for equation one
same, for this case, the shape of the disturbance will remain same with time
if you observe the solution, the solution u at the point p depends on the value of u
also, which is in the double integral
therefore, the solution for this case cannot be written in explicit form however, if we
think about the domain of dependence of u, we can see that u depends only on the behaviour
of cauchy data in the interval q, r and the functions alpha, beta, gamma and f in the
domain capital d
thus, the domain of dependence of equation one coincides with the domain of dependence
of equation fourteen therefore in module two of chapter ten, we have discussed the
phenomena of dispersion and dissipation taking a simple wave equation we have also obtained
the domain of dependence of that equation now, we end this module
on the other hand, in case of non-dispersive wave, the shape of the non-sinusoidal disturbance
will not remain same with time and this particular phenomena is known as the phenomena of dispersion
in this section, i am going to discuss about this phenomena, taking simple wave equation
on two important phenomena, namely the phenomena of dispersion and dissipation now, i am going
first, we take one dimensional wave equation which is written in one del two u del t square
minus del two u del x square plus alpha del u del t plus beta del u del x plus gamma u
equals to f x, t, where t greater than zero, t represent the time variable and the parameters alpha, beta, gamma
these are functions of x and t in particular, they may be constants
we are going to solve equation two, where there is one extra term lambda into u in the
one dimensional wave equation now, we look for a solution which is called the uniform
the function three is called the uniform wave because, it represents a wave propagating
to tell few words about the phenomena of dispersion suppose we have a one dimensional wave equation
with constant velocity c equals to omega by k
now, if lambda equals t zero, we can prove the value of omega is plus minus k and the
solution becomes u is equal to x plus ct plus g into x minus ct, so which is nothing but
solution of wave equation now, if lambda not equals to zero, then if you substitute
plus lambda phi equals to zero, where phi double dash represent
then lambda by omega square minus k square should be a positive number so, for that
case, the solution can be written in simple form which is given in equation number four
so, phi which is function of kx minus omega t is equal to a into e to the power i kx minus
the equation is given by del two u del t square equals to c naught square del two u del x
square minus k square equals to lambda or omega k equals to plus minus square root k
square minus lambda and this relation is called dispersion relation so, dispersion
relation gives us omega as function of k, which is given in equation number five
so, in case of non-dispersive wave, lambda equals to zero and for that case, omega k
equals to plus minus k so, for non-dispersive <?>wave</?>, we can say that omega is equal
k and this is called the phase velocity i have already defined phase velocity and
in case of dispersive wave, you can see that c is not now a constant this is function
square, where c naught is a constant
since, the uniform wave is dispersive when lambda not equals to zero and non-dispersive
when lambda equals to zero the additional term or the zeroth order
the lambda into u term or the addition of zeroth order term gives rise to a
of these waves is represented in equation six so, u t is represented as linear combinations
that means we can prove that the six or u having expression which is written in six,
now, we want the solution of this equation in traveling waves form so, the solution
will satisfy the equation two, provided omega j equals to omega j some function of kj and
omega j equals to plus minus square root kj square plus lambda, where lambda is not equals to zero
if lambda is not equals to zero, the terms in six, corresponding to different kj will
we can generalize this, taking continuous limit of course the limit will exist as j
tends to infinity so, for that case, we obtain the fourier integrals, u equals to integration
minus infinity to plus infinity a k e to the power i kx minus omega k t dk here omega
is not constant this is function of k and you can show that such solution is also dispersive
for lambda not equals to zero
can be written as u is equal to f of kx minus omega t, where k is the wave number and omega
as half of integration minus infinity to plus infinity del u del t square plus del u del
x square plus lambda u square dx so, this denotes the total energy of the system
del u del t, this corresponds to kinetic energy, del u del x is corresponds to potential energy
and this is the total energy
now, if you take the time derivative of u, that means if we differentiate eight with
is the frequency of the wave now, if we substitute this solution to the equation, we obtain that
this phase velocity is always constant
in this section, we shall discuss about the phenomena of dissipation dissipation is defined
as a process where energy is transformed from one form to the other the example of dissipation
process is friction, heat transfer, etcetera it is an irreversible process some, scientist
defined dissipation process as the conversion of mechanical energy to the heat energy
in case of wave motion, dissipation means decrease in amplitude
in this section, i shall discuss the dissipation process taking an example of wave equation
and in the wave equation, we shall relate the term which is responsible for dissipation
the phase velocity of the wave which is defined as small c is equal to omega by k equals to
now, we are going to the slide presentation
to explain the phenomena of dissipation, we take the homogeneous part of equation one
del two u del t square minus del two u del x square plus alpha del u del t plus beta
del u del x plus gamma u equals to zero and in this equation, we considered alpha, beta, gamma
shall show that the constant alpha corresponds to the dissipation
the co-ordinates to characteristic direction xi equals to x plus t and eta equals to x
minus t and in terms of xi and eta, the equation nine is transformed into del two u del xi
c naught for this case that means for a linear wave equation, c equals to c naught which
﻿in module two of chapter ten, we have discussed the phenomena of dispersion
and they can overtake the shorter one and can emerge from the interaction without change of
shape and this is one of the characteristic of the solitons
and these solitons interactions show that the solitons behave like elementary particles
and this phenomena can be observed only in kdv equation
so, the earlier one was some particular solution, now i am going to obtain a
general solution of the equation so we, if we go back to equation six,
so in this equation in the first case we assume that particular solution for which
a equals to zero b equals to zero now, we are not assuming a b as zero
but we are thinking about a bounded solution and which oscillates between zero,
between zero and alpha so, we are seeking a real bounded solution,
such as plasma waves, magneto hydrodynamic waves and the wave with long wave lengths
so for that f dash square must be greater than equals to zero
and it varies monotonically until f dash equals to zero and it has you can see this is a cubic
equation in f so it has three roots since we are thinking about the real solution so this three
roots must be real and we are also interested to find i have already told the oscillatory solution
which oscillates between zero and alpha so, without any loss of generality we choose f one as
to alpha minus beta which is a negative number so, zero less than alpha less than beta
thus, from equation eleven we obtain one third h zero square f dash square equals to f
into alpha minus f into alpha minus f minus alpha plus beta taking square root both side
we obtain equation twelve, where capital u is the
therefore, we divide the entire module into some sub-sections in section one, we shall
velocity of the wave which is given by the relation which you can see in the slide
now, to find the value of this integral we put alpha minus f as alpha into q square
now, we are changing the variable from f to the variable q so with this substitution the
integral in the right hand side becomes d q by one minus q square into one minus m
square q square whole to the power half, where m is equal to alpha by beta to the power half
and this is the famous elliptic integral,
so its solution can be written in terms of jacobian sin function
so q equals to s n of three beta by four h zero square to the power half into x, m,
where m denotes the modulus of the jacobian elliptic function sn z, m
first introduce the kdv equation then we shall solve this equation
square so, if we substitute that alpha into one minus q square we obtain the value of f which is
written in equation fourteen so, the solution is now in terms of elliptic cosine function
and this cn z, m is called the jacobian elliptic function and it is of modulus m,
where we have used the relation cn square z equals to one minus sn square z
it is to be noted that, this c n function is a periodic function
since cn is periodic f x becomes periodic therefore the solution of the kdv equation
becomes periodic and the period p can be obtained from equation thirteen from here we can find the
value of the period as p equals to which is written here in equation number fifteen
let that period equals to lambda where k m is the complete elliptic integral of first kind
and which is defined as k m equals to integration zero to pi by two one minus m sin square theta
assuming traveling wave solution finally, we shall give or tell about the conservation property
to the power minus half d theta so, therefore the general solution
a nonlinear wave whose shape and wavelength depend on the amplitude of the wave
so, if you draw the picture you can see and this wave is called cnoidal wave, this is periodic in
now, i shall discuss two particular cases of the general solution if you take m going to one
that means alpha goes to beta or alpha is equals to beta,
then this c n z function becomes sech hyperbolic z function and the cnoidal wave solution fourteen
it represent the classical solitary wave with wavelength lambda
and which approaches infinity due to this property k one equals to infinity and k zero equals to pi
of kdv equation now, we are going to the slide show of this module
sin function and cn z goes to cos function, it becomes cos function and the solution becomes
f x equals to the solution can be written in terms of sine function and cosine function and with this
substitution k equals to square root three beta by h zero that means beta equals to this
this transform the value of f x as alpha by two into one plus cos k x minus omega t
equals to u into k and this is the dispersion relation for the small amplitude wave equation
and from this dispersion relation you can find that these first two terms are similar
to the first two terms of the dispersion relation in water wave problem
in this section i shall discuss about conservative properties of kdv equation
first i shall introduce kdv equation which is the short form of korteweg -de vries equation
the kdv equation itself is in conservative form, in late nineteen sixties miura
et al discovered that there are infinite number of integral of motion for kdv equation and
it forms completely integrable hamiltonian system and this integral of motion corresponds to
conservation of mass, momentum, energy, etcetera
in this section, i shall discuss about two conservation of mass and energy now,
we are going to the slide presentation an equation is said to be in conservative form
if it can be written in the form which is given in equation number seventeen
that means if it can be written as del t del t plus del x del x equals to zero
where capital t is called the density and capital x is called the flux
assuming that t and x are integrable in the interval minus infinity to plus infinity
first we shall start with the dispersion relation for water waves in an ocean
and if we assume that capital x tends to zero as mod x tends to infinity then
integrating equation seventeen with respect to x over the interval minus infinity to plus infinity
we get d dt of integration minus infinity to plus infinity t d x equals to value of
dx equals to constant, thus the density is conserved
now, we shall go back to the nonlinear kdv equation which is given by del u del t minus six
u del u del x plus del three u del x cube equals to zero this is the standard
equation, standard form of the equation now, this equation can be written in the form
del u del t plus del del t of minus three u square plus del two u del x square equals to zero,
where capital t is equal to small u and capital x can be assumed as
minus three u square plus del two u del x square now, if we integrate this equation with respect
to x over the interval minus infinity to plus infinity that means over the whole real axis
so, the integral in the left hand side represent the total mass of the system therefore, this
integral of motion represent the conservation of mass now, to get the another integral of motion
we multiply the kdv equation that means the first equation of this slide
by u then we can write the terms in this way as del del t of half u square plus del del
x of minus two u cube plus u del u del x minus half del u del x whole square equals to zero
now, if we again integrate this equation with respect to x over the whole real line
h zero is the depth of the ocean, omega is the frequency of the wave and k is the wave number
u square by two d x equals to constant, so this represent the conservation of energy
so, in this way one can prove the other integral of motion or the other conservative properties
of the kdv equation therefore, in module three of chapter ten we have discussed about kdv equation
the solution of nonlinear kdv equation is a solitary wave which is a new phenomena
so, from that equation we can find the value of omega as function of k as g k
in module one of the same chapter, we have discussed about the nonlinear wave equation
into tan hyperbolic k h zero to the power half now, if we expand this function
we will get omega is equivalent to c zero k into one minus one by six k square h zero square,
in many physical problems wave motion with small dispersion exhibit such
now, the equation for free surface elevation which is denoted by the variable eta
plus sigma del cube eta del x cube equals to zero where, sigma is defined as
the equation two is known as linearized kdv equation
and we find that the nonlinearity and the dispersion play a fundamental role
now, in this equation the phase velocity c p is defined as omega by k and its value is c
zero minus sigma k square on the other hand, the group velocity of the wave <?>train</?> which is
denoted by c g and which is defined as d omega d k is equals to c zero minus three sigma k square
and these definitions are given in equation three
from equation three it can be noted that value of the phase velocity is greater than value of
we get c p equals to c zero and c g equals to c zero that means the values of the phase velocity
and the group velocity becomes constant and this is the characteristic of a nondispersive
to find the water wave motion if we consider nonlinear shallow water wave equation, then
in eighteen hundred ninety-five, kdv derived the nonlinear equation for
long waves in a channel of depth h zero and that nonlinear equation is given by
del eta del t plus c zero into one plus three by two eta by h zero del eta del x plus sigma
del cube eta del x cube equals to zero and in this equation you can see nonlinear term
which is here three eta c zero divided by two h zero into del eta del x
and the kdv equation i have already told it arises in many physical problems like
water waves of long wavelengths, plasma waves and magneto hydrodynamic waves, etcetera
now, i want to find traveling wave solution of nonlinear kdv equation which is written
it leads to the breaking phenomena if we don’t consider dispersion
where x equals to x small x minus u t, where u denotes the velocity of the wave
and f is an arbitrary function and we want to find the functional form of f
now, we substitute five into equation four that means into the nonlinear kdv equation
now, since we are going to find the expression for small f we integrate the previous relation
and after integrating we get one by six h zero square f double dash plus three by four f square
plus one minus u by c zero f equals to a, where a is the integrating constant
again this equation can be integrated, so for that we multiply this equation both side by f dash
but this breaking can be prevented if we can incorporate the dispersion effect
now, let us think about the solitary wave solution that means the quantity f, f dash, f double dash
all goes to zero as mod x tends to infinity and we think about that particular solution for which
capital a equals to zero and capital b equals to zero so, under this condition equation six
reduces to, so in equation six we put a equals to zero and b equals to zero
so, it reduces to one third h zero square f dash square plus f square into f minus alpha
equals to zero, where alpha is a constant equals to two into u by c zero minus one
this equals to three by h zero square f square into alpha minus f, then we take the square
root of f dash and then we integrate so, we obtain x minus x zero equals to h zero square by
three square root into integration zero to f d f by f into square root alpha minus f
therefore, the effect of nonlinearity and dispersion is important to explain some physical phenomena
now, to find the value of this integral we substitute f equals to alpha sec h square theta
so, if you substitute that the value of the integral can be obtained easily
so, after integration it becomes x minus x zero equals to four h zero square by three alpha
to the power half into theta
so, the value of f, so if we go back to the previous slide what is f,
to alpha into sech square this is the value of theta which is written in the square bracket
and the final solution that means the value of eta, eta there is a relation between eta and f,
this is the relation which is written in equation number five, eta equals to h zero into f x
so, expression for eta becomes eta zero into sech hyperbolic square into three eta zero by four h
with this purpose in module three of chapter ten we shall discuss about the nonlinear kdv equation
zero cube to the power half into x minus u t, where eta zero is defined as alpha into h zero
so, equation nine gives the solution of the nonlinear kdv equation
and this solution is called solitary wave solution
so, if you brought the solution, so this represent a single hump
about x equals to zero, capital x equals to zero and the amplitude becomes zero that
means eta become zero as mod x tends to plus infinity or minus infinity and this humps goes
in the right direction of small x axis with velocity u and the value of u can be determined
from this relation in the middle of the slide you can see that
alpha equals to two into u by c zero minus one so, from this relation you can find the value of u
where both the nonlinearity and the dispersion effects are considered
and this u gives the velocity of the soliton so, u equals to one plus alpha by two into c zero
so, here you can get the value of the u, u equals to c zero into one plus alpha by two and you know
the value of alpha, so if you substitute you get u equals to c zero one plus eta zero by two h zero
it is to be noted that the velocity of the wave depends on eta zero or in other words
velocity is proportional to eta zero therefore, the taller soliton moves with
more velocity than the shorter solution or soliton and the width of the soliton
which you can obtain from this, so width of the soliton is
three eta zero by four h cube to the power minus half that means
narrower width, therefore taller solitons moves faster and are narrower than the shorter ones
we have considered kdv equation because this equation arises in many physical problems
one of the major challenges in the field of complex system is the understanding of the
minus two u u minus two a since, it has two roots u one, u two, it can be factorized as
that means du by u minus u one into u minus u two equals to d xi by two nu
we can integrate this after integration it gives its value is equals
to one by u one minus u two, log of u one minus u divided by u minus u two therefore,
our solution u, therefore, our solution u can be obtained from the first line as, u
equals to u one plus u two e to the power xi by two nu u one minus u two, divided by
one plus e to the power xi by two nu into u one minus u two so, it can be written as,
u two plus u one minus u two by one plus e to the power xi by two nu u one minus u two
module is divided into three sections in the first section we shall discuss about or
half of u one minus u two, tan hyperbolic xi by two nu u one minus u two so, if you
this at xi equals to minus infinity its value is u one at xi equals to plus infinity its
since u one is greater than u two so, it will be monotonically decreasing function
of xi
and at the point xi equals to zero, it takes the average value of u one and u two that
you can see from the figure, this so, this is the traveling wave solution, this is the
solve the linear burger equation in the second section we shall try to find the traveling
is a decreasing function of xi, and the shape of the wave form is significantly affected
by the diffusion coefficient nu if you see the solution, the shape of the curve depends
on the parameter nu and this is the diffusion coefficient
affected by the diffusion coefficient nu the diffusion process prevents the gradual
distortion of the wave profile, so it does not break on the other hand, in the absence
of diffusion coefficient nu, the wave profile suffers from gradual distortion and steepening
in burger's equation the nonlinearity and the diffusion term balance each other to make
a stable wave profile
wave solution of burger's equation finally, we shall find the exact solution of burger's
in last two sections, we have discussed about the solution of linear burger's equation,
and we also found the solution of nonlinear burger's equation but, it is to be mentioned
that it is possible to find exact solution of burger's equation in nineteen hundred
fifty, the scientist cole and hopf separately discovered a transformation using which the
nonlinear burger's equation can be transformed to a linear diffusion equation now, i am
going to describe that transformation
i have already discussed about the nonlinear burger's equation, which is written in equation
number one now, i am going to solve that equation together with the initial condition
u at time t equals to zero equals to capital f x now, we write equation thirteen
equation using the cole-hopf transformation now, we are going to our slide show
nu del u del x equals to zero this can be considered as the compatibility condition
for the existence of the function psi such that u can be written as del psi del x and
the term within the bracket that means mu, nu del u del x minus half u square equals
to del psi del t, which are written in equation number fifteen
psi, which is written in equation sixteen nu del two psi del x square minus half del
we are trying to transform the variable psi to another variable phi such that psi equals
to minus two nu log phi and we know that u equals to del psi del x, so in terms of
first, i am defining the burger's equation this is a simple model of turbulence and it can be
is called cole-hopf transformation
now, using this transformation we are trying to write equation sixteen in terms of the
two phi del x square and you can see that this is a linear second order equation with
constant coefficient, so it’s very easy to solve, and this equation contains only
together with the initial condition, let phi is described at time t equals to zero by the
function capital phi
we are going to establish the relation between the function capital phi and capital f, so,
derived from navier-stoke's equation the burger's equation in one dimension is
capital f x equals to u x at time t equals to zero so, that equals to in terms of phi
if we integrate we can obtain the value of phi x zero equals to e to the power minus
one by two nu integration capital f alpha d alpha, which is written in equation number nineteen
therefore, we have to find the solution of equation eighteen, together with the initial
condition nineteen and it is very easy to find the solution of that initial value problem
so, phi can be written as, phi equals to one divided by two square root pi nu t, integration
minus infinity to plus infinity capital phi, e to the power minus x minus xi square by
written as del u del t plus u del u del x equals to nu del two u del x square one dimension
nineteen
now, substituting the value of capital phi in equation twenty, we obtain the solution
in the form phi equals to one divided by two square root pi nu t, integration e to the
zero to xi f alpha d alpha
and del phi del x is equals to minus one divided by four nu square root pi nu t, integration
x minus xi by t, e to the power minus f by two nu d xi therefore, the exact solution
of phi or the expression for phi
so, if you substitute that here in seventeen, you obtain the solution which is written in
means, i want to say that there is only one space variable which is denoted by small x
equation number twenty three so, here you have to substitute the value of phi and the
value of del phi del x, so that gives this solution so, in this way we can obtain the
exact solution of nonlinear burger's equation using cole-hopf transformation
thus, in module four of chapter ten, we have discussed about the burger's equation, where
we have considered both nonlinear terms and the diffusion term the role of nonlinearity
the wave profile therefore, the joint effect of nonlinearity and diffusion makes a stable
wave front now, we end this module
now, equation one, nu represent the kinematic viscosity
so, this is the dissipation term, and the nonlinear term is u del u del x so, burger's
equation is a balance between the time evolution, nonlinearity and the diffusion term
equals to nu del two u del x square, where t is the time variable and x runs from minus
infinity to plus infinity
that means x can take in any value in the real axis we have also the initial condition
another constant value u two, for x greater than zero now, we are going to solve equation
two, together with the initial condition which is given in equation three since, equation
this phenomena can be understood using the navier-stoke’s equation, which is a nonlinear partial differential
two is a linear equation with constant coefficient, we can apply any methods in particular one
can use fourier transform method to find solution
so, if we use fourier transform method and use the initial condition three, it is easy
to find that solution can be written in the form, u equals to half of u one plus u two
minus half of u one minus u two into error function of x divided by two square root nu
out the initial distribution like nu t to the power minus half and you can also verify that,
to plus infinity, u tends to the another constant value u two therefore, solution four satisfies
the initial conditions
equation in nineteen hundred thirty nine, the dutch scientist burger first simplified
we drop the diffusion term in one so, if we go back to equation one that means if you
and we know the solution of first order wave equation, which i have discussed in module
one of this chapter, that this gives a shock wave solution or in other words, the nonlinearity
combines two opposite effects of nonlinearity and diffusion
in the absence of diffusion, the resulting equation which i already told you this is
the shock wave solution does not exist and the shock wave solution is smooth out by the
the navier-stoke's equation dropping the pressure term the term or the equation containing
term is linearized, that means the convictive term is u del u del x here, we are taking
the linear convictive term that means, we are taking the convictive term as alpha into
del u del x, where alpha is a constant
so, we are going to solve equation five, again we are assuming a plane wave solution of this
equation so, solution is assumed in the form u equals to a e to the power i kx minus omega
t, where imaginary part of omega equals to minus nu k square, which is less than zero,
for nu greater than zero
the time derivative, nonlinear term and the diffusion term is known as burger’s equation
written in equation number seven now, this solution represent a diffusive wave with wave
number k and phase velocity c
and if you see the amplitude of the wave, which is a times e to the power minus nu k
wavelength becomes weaker with larger nu
generally, in burger's equation the external force field is not present there are many
only the disturbances of long wavelength will survive and i have already told that if nu
is less than zero, solution seven tends to infinity, that means the solution becomes
so, to analyze that, to find that we assume a traveling wave solution in the form u x,
also given that the wave form with this property
infinity, and it tends to another constant value u two, as xi tends to plus infinity
application of burger's equation in applied mathematics, namely in gas dynamics, fluid
equation which is given in equation number one
two u d xi square equals to zero
now, this shows that there are two roots, if we see right hand side of this equation
dynamics, traffic flow, nonlinear acoustics flow, et-cetera therefore, this module or
those constant values, du d xi equals to zero therefore, the roots of the quadratic equation
u square minus two capital u small u minus two a equals to zero are small u one and small
u two solving this quadratic equation one can get the value of capital u as half of
u one plus u two, and the value of capital a which is product of two roots u one, u two
a can be written in terms of products of two roots, so a equals to minus half u one u two
so, from equation ten you can see that capital u that means the wave speed is the average
the module four of chapter ten is devoted to the study of burger's equation the entire
now, i am going to start module five of chapter ten this module is devoted to the study of
into two factor in f square so,let capital f equals to alpha one minus alpha two f square
into beta one minus beta two f square
where, the constants alpha’s and beta’s are determined from the equations alpha equals
to minus alpha one beta two plus alpha two beta one and capital a equals to alpha one
beta one, and gamma equals to minus two alpha two beta two and we also assuming,
the equation sixteen as df dx equals to square root of alpha one minus alpha two f square
into beta one minus beta two f square
now, we separate the variables f and x, and obtain the value of capital x as integration
one to the power half into f as our new variable u so, in terms of the new variable u, the
above integral becomes sigma x equals to integration zero to u du, by square root one minus u square
into one minus kappa square u square where, the new constant kappa and sigma are given
by which you can be seen in the last line of this slide
now, this integral is a famous integral, and it is an elliptic integral of first kind,
and we can find the value of this integral in terms of the elliptic function, jacobian
function so, the solution can be expressed in terms of jacobian sin function,
we can obtain the value of f x as alpha one by alpha two to the power half into this is
the value of u so, this is our required solution in particular,
if the value of the integrating constant a equals to zero, so if we comeback
to the general solution, which is written in equation number sixteen so, in particular
sixteen gives square root alpha x equals to integration
zero to f, df by f into one minus gamma by two alpha f square to the power half
now, to compute this integral the natural substitution is gamma by two alpha to the power half, into
f equals to the sech h theta
and substituting this, we can find the value of the integral exactly so, f x becomes two
velocity u so, if you observe the solution, so it represent the wave moves with constant
velocity u, and it is to be noted that the solitary wave exist only for unstable case
that means when gamma is greater than zero and one interesting feature is that the amplitude
and the velocity of the wave are independent
whereas, in case of kdv equation, the speed depends on the amplitude of the
wave so, this is the basic difference between the solution of kdv equation and the nonlinear
schrodinger’s equation now, i want to derive nonlinear schrodinger’s equation for deep
water waves problem, starting from the dispersion relation the deep water waves problem,
so, from this relation we can find the value of omega zero dash, omega zero double dash,
and gamma, which is written in equation number twenty one now, substituting these values
in the amplitude equation, we can get the nonlinear schrodinger’s equation for deep
think about that frame, which is moving with linear group velocity omega zero dash
in that frame, equation twenty two reduces to the form, which is written in equation twenty three
a nonlinear schrodinger’s equation for deep water waves starting from the dispersion relation
now, we want to solve this equation mainly, they are interested to find the solitary wave solution
of the previous equation, that means of equation twenty three so, for that we
assume the solution in the form amplitude a equals to g x into e to the power i gamma
square t, where capital x is small x minus omega zero dash t
so, for that we multiply this equation by two dg dx, and then integrate and we obtain
equation twenty six if we see the right hand side of this equation that means the value
g zero square minus g zero into g square minus m dash square g zero square where,
g zero to the power four m dash square is the integrating constant, and if we write
has a sharp peak around k zero, with a narrow wave number of width delta k equals
this expression as two factors then comparing the coefficients we can get the relation between
the parameters as two k zero to the power four equals to one, and we assuming m dash
square as one minus m square so, it gives the value of g zero square as four gamma square
by omega zero k zero square into m square minus two now, if we go back to equation
twenty six, we take the square root of this equation
so, that gives dg dx equals to square root of g zero square minus g square, into g square
minus m dash square into g zero square then we separate the variables g and x, and we
obtain the relation which is written in the third or the last line of this slide now,
the variables g and x are separated, so we can integrate it so, after integration we
get g zero into x minus x zero equals to integration ds by one minus s square into s square minus
to k minus k zero and this delta k is very small, and we are assuming that as order of
the value of the integral is dn g zero x minus x zero into m, where m is the modulus
schrodinger’s equation for deep water wave problem in nineteen hundred seventy two,
zakharov and shabat proved that nonlinear schrodinger’s equation has infinite number
of conservation laws these are in the form of integral with respect to x of the polynomials
in psi and its derivatives
in this section i am going to establish two conservative laws, now we are going to the slide presentation
to prove the conservation properties, we multiply the standard nonlinear
schrodinger’s equation which is given by equation number fourteen by psi bar
of psi x psi bar minus psi x bar psi equals to zero
schrodinger’s equation to find the another integral we multiply equation fourteen again
by psi x bar and its complex conjugate by psi x, and then adding we get equation number
equation number fourteen
taylor series expansion as, omega at k equals to omega at k zero, plus
and the equation for its complex conjugate with respect to x, then we multiply the former
equation by psi bar and the equation for complex conjugate by psi and then we add this
two equation, and this leads to the equation which is written in twenty nine now, subtracting
after simplification equals to d dx of psi bar psi xx, plus psi into psi bar xx plus
gamma d dx of mod psi to the power four
d dt of integration psi bar psi x minus psi psi x bar dx equals to zero that means the
quantity integration of psi psi x bar minus psi bar psi x dx remain constant, and let
that constant is c two in the similar way we can prove that the quantity integration
schrodinger’s equation the discussion on linear and nonlinear schrodinger’s equations
mod psi x square minus gamma by two mod psi to the power four dx also remain constant
the derivation of this integral is available in our e-text
so, we get three integral of motion c one, c two, c three and they are related to the
number of particles, momentum and the energy of the system governed by the nonlinear schrodinger’s equation
so, in this way we can obtain other integrals of this equation thus in module
five of chapter ten, we have discussed about nonlinear schrodinger’s equation in this
equation we have considered the effect of dispersion and nonlinearity the joint effect
in this case the amplitude and the velocity are independent parameters in contrast to
kdv equation, the amplitude and the velocity are not independent velocity depends on the
k zero plus dot dot
amplitude of the wave thus, we end this module, at the same time we are ending the entire
course partial differential equation
so, here omega zero is equal to omega at k zero, omega zero dash equals to omega dash
k zero that is d omega dk at k equals to k zero, and omega zero double dash represent
d two omega dk square at k equals to k zero
to the power i x minus omega zero dash t delta k, minus half i omega zero double dash delta
k square into t, into d of delta k
that omega as the odd function of k, that means omega at minus k equals to minus of
omega k if we see the expression for psi which is written in equation number four,
of x minus omega zero dash t and t
power i k zero x minus omega zero t plus its complex conjugate where the modulated wave
mechanics, fluid dynamics, nonlinear optics, plasma dynamics, et-cetera we shall first
the power i x minus omega zero dash t delta k, minus half i omega zero double dash delta
k square t into d of delta k
now, writing this expression in terms of xi and tau, a becomes a equals to integration
now, in this expression, in the expression six, k zero is considered as constant therefore,
a del tau variation of a with respect to the slow variable tau, can be computed from the
expression of a, which is given in equation number seven
so, from seven we can easily find del a del tau equals to minus half i omega zero double
derive linear schrodinger’s equation and nonlinear schrodinger’s equation starting
del two a del xi square equals to zero, which is given by equation number
now, we want to derive the nonlinear schrodinger’s equation starting from the dispersion relation
from a dispersion relation then, we shall find the solitary wave solution of nonlinear
a square in the dispersion relation
so the slow variation of amplitude can be written as this so,in the previous, from
the previous expression or from equation ten, if we expand it in taylor series expansion,
is nothing but the dispersion relation for the linear equation or the linear dispersion
relation, so, the first term becomes zero
schrodinger’s equation finally, we shall establish conservative laws for schrodinger’s
that del del x star is of order epsilon, and del del t star is of order epsilon square
a square a equals to zero
twelve is known as nonlinear schrodinger’s equation if you observe this equation you
way we can derive nonlinear schrodinger’s equation starting from the dispersion relation
now, we want to solve the nonlinear schrodinger’s equation so, to solve nonlinear schrodinger’s
equation now, we are going to the first slide of this module
equation, we take the standard form of the equation which is written in fourteen
we are interested to find the solitary wave solution, that’s why we have taken the solution
in the form psi equals to f x e to the power i mx minus nt, where capital x equals to small
is written in the first line of this slide, where f double dash represents the derivative
of f with respect to capital x two times and f dash is the derivative with respect
to capital x once
to derive one dimensional linear schrodinger’s equation, we consider the fourier representation
becomes zero so, we assume two m minus u equals to zero, and we take alpha as m square
to simply f so, the above equation reduces to the form f double dash minus alpha f
to find the expression for small f
so, for that purpose we multiply the equation with two f dash, and then we integrate after
integration we get, f dash square equals to a plus alpha f square, minus gamma by two
f to the power four, where, capital a is the integrating constant let the expression in
the right hand side of equation sixteen is function of small f, and that function is
of the quasi-monochromatic plane wave solution in the form phi equals to integration capital
hello friend
the laws of motion
he expressed the equation in terms of ordinary differential equation in seventeenth century
of euler, d’alembert's, lagrange and laplace
they used partial differential equation as a tool to describe the phenomena observed
in continuum mechanics
the partial differential equation was mainly used then for modeling of many physical phenomena
observed in nature
i have already told you in my introductory video that the entire course is divided into ten chapters
algebraic geometry, topology, etcetera
the detailed history of partial differential equation can be found in any book related
to history of mathematics
now, we are going to start the first slide of part one of module one
let me first define what is a partial differential equation?
an equation involving two or more independent variables and one dependent variable and it's
all order derivatives is called a partial differential equation
thus, the general form of a partial differential equation can be represented by equation number
define all other partial derivatives
so, in the first day and in the first week we are going to start module one of chapter one
now, in equation number two, we have shown some partial differential equations so these
are the examples of partial differential equations
now, we want to define order of a partial differential equation, the highest order derivative
present in a partial differential equation is called the order of that differential equation
if you observe equation number three, there are two equations, in the first equation the
highest order partial derivative is two and also in the second equation the highest order
derivative partial derivative is also two
so, equation three gives the examples of second order partial differential equation
now, if we observe equation number four, the highest order partial derivatives present
in this equation is three
chapter one is divided into three modules, so today we are going to start the first module
so, this is an example of a third order partial differential equation
now, according to complexity in a partial differential equation we can categorize a
partial differential equation into four categories
the simplest one is the linear partial differential equation
a partial differential equation is said to be linear if it is linear in the unknown function
and all its derivatives
one example of a linear differential equation is given in equation number five
so, if you see the coefficients of the derivatives in this equation they are only function of
x and y, so this is a linear differential equation
now, we shall define a quasi linear differential equation
and also the module one is divided into two parts
a partial differential equation is said to be quasi linear if it is linear in the highest
order derivative of the unknown function
the coefficient of highest order term may be function of independent variables, dependent variables
and the lower order derivatives
one example of quasi linear equation is the kdv equation which is written in equation
number six and this is a third order quasi linear differential equation and this equation
appears in plasma physics and in nonlinear dynamics
now, we shall define a semi-linear partial differential equation
a partial differential equation is said to be semi-linear if it is linear in the highest
order derivative of the unknown function, but there is a difference between a quasi
so, first we will start part one of module one of chapter one
linear and semi-linear differential equation, in case of a semi-linear differential equation
the coefficients of higher order derivative are only function of independent variables
but in contrast, in case of quasi linear equation the coefficient of highest order derivatives
may be function of dependent variables and the partial derivatives of lower order
one example of semi-linear equation is written in equation number seven and another example
is also given in equation number eight, where del square is the laplacian and which is defined
as del two del x square del two del y square del two del z square
the equation number six appears in differential geometry
and the most complicated equation which does not belong to the earlier categories, that
means the equation which is neither linear nor quasi linear or nor semi-linear that equation
in this part, i shall give definition of partial differential equation and i shall also classify
is called a nonlinear equation
a nonlinear equation is very complex and very difficult to solve
this is one example of non-linear equation
so, in this part you have learned the definition of partial differential equation and its classification
so, there are four types of partial differential equation according to the presence of non-linearity,
but it is to be noted that though the linear pde is the simplest one it is very difficult
to solve a linear problem
in some few cases, in some particular cases we can solve a linear differential equation
and in some few cases we can solve semi linear equations but finding analytical solution
that equation according to the non-linearity present in that equation
to find solution
you can learn this method in the course of numerical analysis
in this way we end this part
so, before going to the main slide, let me say a few words about the history of partial
differential equation
﻿hi friend today i am going to start part two of module one in part one, we have defined
at the end of module one you will get some problem for self-assessment so, in this way we end module
where the partial differential appears together with some supplementary condition
consider a thin homogeneous perfectly flexible string which is under uniform tension along
x axis in its equilibrium position and the end of the string are fixed at x equals to zero
and x equals to l now, the string is pulled aside a short distance and then released
so, the string will now under free vibration so the motion of the string
can be written by the differential equation del two u del t square equals to c square
del two u del x square and this equation is known as wave equation and
there are some conditions those are to be maintained to solve this problem, those are
initial conditions so, initial conditions
which is the condition which is given at time t equals to zero, so u x at zero equals to f x
partial differential equation, we have also classified those equation but, to describe
that means we are assuming the position of the string or being some function f x and the
velocity of the string is given by the function g x and we also have the boundary conditions
u zero t equals to zero and u l t equals to zero since the two end of the string are fixed
so, the initial conditions and the boundary conditions are the supplementary conditions,
so we have to solve the partial differential equation together with these two conditions
now, if the, if the problem is in unbounded medium then we cannot define any boundary conditions,
then the equation is to be solved together with the initial condition
so that type of problems are called initial value problem or cauchy problem
so, this is one example of initial value problem, this is heat equation,
one dimensional heat equation and the supplemented condition is given by u x zero equals to f x so,
some natural phenomena we need to solve a partial differential equation of some physical quantity
this is the initial temperature field so according to the supplementary condition we can divide
a problem or a mathematical problem into some categories like initial value problem,
boundary value problem or mixed initial boundary value problem
before solving a partial differential equation we have to think about the solvability of the
partial differential equation a mathematical problem is said to be well-posed if it satisfies
the following three conditions the first one is the existence, which says that there
is at least one solution of the problem and the second one is the uniqueness which says
that there is at most one solution and the third important criteria is the continuity, that is the
solution depends continuously on the data so, a mathematical problem is said to be
well-posed if it satisfies all three conditions so, it is possible to find a solution of
together with some auxiliary conditions there are two types of auxiliary conditions,
a well-posed problem a problem which is not well-posed that means which does not satisfies
any of the above three conditions is called an ill-posed problem an ill-posed problem cannot be
solved mathematically now, i want to illustrate
the concept of existence, uniqueness and continuity using some examples
let us first consider the example ux square plus uy square equals to one, this is given
differential equation and we have to solve this equation using the auxiliary condition uy is
conditions which do not satisfy the given equation may lead to the no solution of that problem
so this is the example, if you see the boundary condition uy is greater than zero,
this condition will not satisfy the equation, you will not get any real solution of this problem,
one is called initial condition and the other one is called boundary condition
so there does not exist any solution of this problem
now, to illustrate the idea of uniqueness we have considered the motion of transfers
motion of a string which is described by the first order wave equation which is given in the second
example del two u del t square is equal to c square del two u del x square
and the string is clamped at the two points at x equals to zero and x equals to l,
so that is described by the boundary condition u zero t equals to zero u lt equals to zero
and this is to be solved together with the cauchy condition u x zero equals to f x, so these gives
sufficient to find the unique solution, that means what will be the transfer speed of the
string that is not described here so, for different values of the transfer speed one
if the physical quantity is prescribed at some particular time, then those type of conditions
can get different answer, so for this example, uniqueness of the solution is not valid
now, i am going to discuss the continuity or the stability of the solution so, for the
for this case we are considering the same equation, one dimensional wave equation
and the initial conditions is given by u x zero equals to u cap and u t x zero is equal to v cap
let the solution of the first set of equation is u now, we deviate,
now deviate the initial condition in a small amount, so we are trying to find the solution
of the equation but the initial condition is slightly different from the original one
so, you can see that u cap is replaced by u cap is replaced by u one cap
and v cap is replaced by v one cap but these u one cap and v one cap
these two functions are very near to the function u cap, v cap that means in mathematical sense
are called initial conditions, on the other hand if that physical quantity is described
we can define their norm u cap minus u one cap is less than epsilon and v cap minus v one cap
is less than epsilon where epsilon is greater than zero so an epsilon is some suitably chosen
constant and this is valid for zero less than equals to x less than equals to l
now, we can say that this equation is stable, this problem is stable if the solution of the
first set of equation and the solution of the second set of equations are differ by very small
amount so in mathematical sense we can say that if u one is the solution of the corresponding
change initial condition and u is the solution of the original problem,
then if this condition is hold that means norm of u minus u one is less than delta where delta
is greater than zero some suitable constant and delta depends on the constant epsilon
so, if this condition is hold we can say that the continuity condition also hold
at some particular point in space, then those type of conditions are known as boundary conditions
so, we have learned that if these three conditions existence, uniqueness and continuity
condition holds we can say that the problem is well-posed and a well-posed problem is solvable,
we can find solution of a well-posed problem but the solution of ill-posed problem does not exist
so, this is the example of one ill-posed problem this was first observed by french mathematician
hadamard so he tried to solve the laplace equation which is given by uxx plus cyy equals to zero
in the half plane x greater than zero, together with the condition u at zero y equals to zero
and the derivative of u at x equals to zero is e to the power minus root n,
n sine ny this equation has, it can be proved that this equation has a unique solution and that
solution is given by un x, y is equal to e to the power minus root n e to the power nx sine ny
so, this solution will satisfy both the equation and the boundary conditions
in this video we are going to explain those auxiliary conditions
but it is to be noted that if n is very large then un x, y as well the derivative of u and
x tends to zero for y is equal to zero but un x, y takes a large value when y is not equal
to zero so there is a discontinuity in the line y is equal to zero so, when y is equal
to zero the solution is zero and when y is not equals to zero solution increases infinitely
so continuity condition does not holds here so, this is one example of ill-posed problem
therefore in this part you have learned about different auxiliary conditions you also got
introduced with the well-posed problem therefore, in a nutshell we can say that in module one
the knowledge of surfaces and curves are required so, that part is not discussed in this video
if you wish you can go through the study material attached with this video apart from that
now, we shall take one example, so this is example of a physical system
﻿this is module two of chapter one, this module is devoted to the solution of simultaneous
equation we will get three values of rho and let us suppose that those three roots are
rho one, rho two and rho three, therefore in the previous expression each of this quantity
can be written in this form that means the given equation are proportional to
this value, that means here we are taking the value rho as rho one and here we are taking
the value rho as rho two and here we are taking the value rho of rho three and the corresponding
values of lambda mu and nu are considered and these three expressions are same
get an equation of this form and the third, there will be a third relation corresponding to rho
equals to rho three and lambda three, mu three, nu three so equating the first one and third one
we will get a equation of a surface like this thus, we get two integrals
of the given equation so, in this way using method two we can solve the given equation
now, we are going to describe method three which is most simplest, in this case
we are assuming that one of the variable say z is absent from one equation of the
set that means in the equation dx by p equals to dy by q equals to dz by r in this equation,
z is absent so dy dx is q by p but there is no any z, so we can solve it, this is a first-order
differential equation, so we can solve it easily and plate that solution is f xy c one
equals to zero now, from this expression eliminating x or writing y as function
of x and substituting that in the original equation we can get the other integral
now, we will explain that method taking this example, we have to find the integral of this
equation so, if you see this equation you can see that if we take the second
and third one you can eliminate the function x from these two equation so if we eliminate x
from the second and third equation that will give equation dy dz equals to y by z or in other words
we can find the solution as y is equal to c one z, where c one is the integrating constant
now, using this form of y if we substitute in the first equation the functional form of y
or the value of y if you substitute here, we will get a relation like this where c one is
arbitrary constant, now this equation first and third equation this will give a equation which
is solvable and integrating this equation we will get another integral which is written here
x square plus y square plus z square equals to c two z, therefore there are two integral of
that given equation one is y is equal to c one z and the other one is x square plus y
square plus z square equals to c two z so, in this way we can solve the simultaneous equation
ways, this is one way and this is another way now, before solving a simultaneous equation
using method three now, we shall discuss
how the method of solving simultaneous equation can be applied in geometrical problem
in the geometrical problem we shall show that how to find orthogonal trajectories of a system
of orthogonal curves now, we shall discuss how
to find orthogonal trajectories of a system of curves on a given surface
suppose the equation of a surface is given by equation number seven, f x, y, z equals to zero
and there is a system of curves on this surface and let the equation of the curve is given by
together with equation seven and equation eight since, in equation eight there is one parameter c,
so seven and eight together represent a system of curves where for different values of c we
we have to know about the existence and uniqueness theorem it tells about
for example, let us take a cone, the equation of this cone
is given by x square plus y square equals to z square tan square alpha now,
if we cut this plane by the plane z equals to c then different values of c
we will get a curve for this case this is a system of circles so, we are interested to find
a system of curves which are perpendicular to all these circles so for this case,
these are they are nothing but the generator of this cone now, how to find mathematically?
orthogonal trajectories of a system of curves is described in the next slide
now, we know that dx, dy, dz represent the tangential direction to a given curve
and the equation of the curve we already know is represented by equation seven and equation eight
whether a system of equations or simultaneous equation will have a solution or not
plus del f del y dy plus del f del z dz equals to zero and the similar equation for g
now, if we solve these two equation we will get a simultaneous equation like this where p, q,
r they are function of del f, del x del f del y del f del z and del g del x del g del y del
g del z and these expressions are written here so, these are the jacobians of the function f
the curve through x, y, z of the orthogonal system has the tangential direction dx dash, dy dash,
dz dash, then it will satisfy the equation del f del x dx dash plus del f del y dy dash plus
del f del z dz dash equals to zero since the orthogonal systems also lies on the surface f
suppose, the function f which is function of x, y, z and the function g be defined and continuous
and it is perpendicular to the original curve that means dx dx dash dy dy dash dz dz dash
must be equals to zero and dx, dy, dz they are proportional to p, q, r
so, we arrive to the equation number eleven now, we have to solve for dx dash, dy dash,
dz dash and these dx dash, dy dash, dz dash are given by equation ten and eleven
and solving ten and eleven we can write the simultaneous equation in this form,
where expressions for p dash, q dash, r dash are written in equation number thirteen
now, this equation we have to find, we have to solve the equation number twelve
that will give the system of orthogonal trajectories
now, we shall take one example to visualize the thing more clearly
suppose, we have a surface x square plus y square plus two fyz plus d equals to zero and the
in some region mod x minus a less than k, mod y minus b less than l and mod z minus c
orthogonal, the system of curves are represented by this surface and the intersection of this
surface with the xy plane that means the equation of the system of curves is represented by z equals
to k and this surface that means x square plus y square plus two fyz plus d equals to zero now,
satisfy the equation x dx plus y plus fzdy plus fy dz equals to zero and also dz equals to zero
now, solving these two equations we will get this relation, this is a simultaneous equation
in three variables and now we want to find a direction which is orthogonal to this direction
so that direction, if that direction is dx, dy, dz so this will satisfy this equation since the
orthogonal trajectories will must lie on the given surface so this equation will be satisfied
and the orthogonal trajectories is perpendicular to the given system of curves so this equation
will be satisfied so, if we solve these two equations then that will give the differential
equation for the orthogonal trajectories now, we solve the simultaneous equation using the
method, different methods which we have described already we will get the solution like this,
of the surface which is written here so, the system of orthogonal trajectories is given by
this equation and the integral of this curve that means this equation, fyz plus d equals to cx
thus, the solution of the given equation is given by fyz plus d equals to cx which is
integral of this equation and the equation of the surface x square plus
y square plus two fyz plus d equals to zero thus in brief we learned how to find solution of a
simultaneous equation of first order first degree, we have learned three different methods to solve
which are written in equation number two the first one is the lipschitz condition to the
those equations and we have also learned how to find orthogonal trajectories of a system
function f with respect to the variable y and z and the second one is the lipschitz condition to
differential equation of first-order and first degree these type of equations has applications
the function g with respect to the variable y and z so, if these two conditions are satisfied and
here this ai and bi’s are some finite constant so, if these lipschitz condition is satisfied
then the given system of equations, that means the equation dy dx equals to f x, y, z or dz
dx equals to g x, y, z has some solution which is continuous and having continuous derivatives
in a suitable interval mod of x minus a less than h
so, this is an important theorem regarding the existence of a simultaneous differential equation
so, if these conditions are satisfied then only simultaneous equation has some solutions
now, we shall discuss different methods for finding solution of simultaneous equation
now, if we go back to the representation one of the simultaneous equation,
in mathematical physics and in this module we shall solve or rather we will discuss
if you take the first two equation dx by p equals to dy by q,
suppose this equation is solvable then we will get a relation of this form
u one x, y, z equals to c one now, if you take the second and third equation
that means dy by q equals to dz by r then we will get another relation
you two x, y, z equals to c two and we have already read that a function u one x, y, z equals
to c one represent equation of a surface and u two x, y, z equals to c two represent equation
of another surface but these two equations together represent equation of a curve therefore,
equation four represent a system of curve with two parameters and those two parameters are c one and
c two so, here we learn that the simultaneous equation in three variables, the general
solution of this type of equation is a system of curves with two arbitrary parameters
different methods for solving the simultaneous equations and later on we shall discuss how to use
now, we are going to discuss how to find the integral curves, curve of a given equation
we find t one that we want to describe? now, any tangential direction through the point x, y, z to
the above surface will satisfy the relation du one equals to, this is the total derivative of u one,
equals to zero, del u one del x dx plus del u one dy dy del u one del z dz equals to zero and
as the function p dash and del u one del y as the function q dash and del u one del z as the
function r dash, then these equation becomes pp dash plus qq dash plus rr dash equals to zero
so, our aim is to find p dash, q dash, r dash such that the equation five holds and at the same time
the concept of solving simultaneous differential equation to solve geometrical problem
this du one that means p dash dx plus q dash dy plus r dash dz
must be an exact differential, therefore, our aim is to find p dash, q dash,
r dash which satisfy this equation and this is an exact differential
now, we shall take one example then it will be more clear
suppose we have to find integral curves of this simultaneous equation
zero and these p dash, q dash, r dash are such that p dash dx and q dash dy plus r dash dz
this must be an exact differential so, with this choice of p dash, q dash,
r dash it becomes exact differential and that is written here so, for this
in this module, we shall mainly discuss how to solve a simultaneous equations in
equation we get one integral curve u one equals to x plus y into z plus one
now, to find the general solution of this equation we need two integral curves, so
we again choose three functions p double dash, q double dash, r double dash
in this way and we also see that it satisfies this relation pp double dash, qq double dash plus
rr double dash equals to zero not only that it satisfies also this quantity with this choice of p
dash, q dash, r dash, this quantity becomes exact differential so our next, the second integral
is u two equals to x minus y into z minus c therefore, the general solution of the system,
given system of equations can be written in this form so this is one integral and this is another
integral and these two equations represent equation of a curve with two parameters
now, we shall describe another method to find integral, in the previous method
three variables, the general representation of a simultaneous equation in three variables is
we have chosen p dash, q dash, r dash, p double dash, q double dash, r double dash
arbitrary but in other words we can say that with using trial and error method we found
the expressions for p dash, q dash, r dash and p double dash, q double dash, r double dash,
but if we want to find the values, the expressions for these variables mathematically,
we have some derivation now this is our given equation now, this is equals to p double dash
dash, q dash, r dash in such a way that it becomes total differential or exact differential
so, let this is dw dash and this is dw double dash, so if we equate these two quantity,
then we will get a relation between the two integral w dash equals to w double dash plus c
so, using this method we can find the integral curves now, let us take this example
using method two you want to find integral curves of this equation so, this is our p,
this is our q and this is our z and in this equation alpha, beta, gamma are constants now,
now we multiply the numerator with lambda,
d lambda into dx, we compute this mu into dy, mu into dz divided by this,
now we want to find the values of lambda mu nu such that each of the expression
now, we shall take one example to explain the method two, we have to find integral
curves of this equation in this equation alpha, beta, gamma are constants now in method two,
we try to write the equation in this form lambda dx plus mu dy mu dz divided by lambda into y plus
we do not know the values of lambda mu nu and we want this expression is to be exact differential
that means, this expression can be written in the form one by rho lambda dx plus mu dy plus
nu dz divided by lambda x plus mu y plus nu z now, these two equations, the previous expression
and this expression will be equal or equivalent if and only if,
in the numerator these two expressions are same but in the denominator to make the equivalent
rho that means beta mu equals plus nu equals to lambda rho and similarly
equating the coefficients of y from the denominator we will get other two equations
now, to find the nonzero values of lambda mu nu we have the condition,
the determinant of this matrix must be equals to zero, so that will give a cubic equation in rho
in terms where the coefficients are written in terms of alpha, beta, gamma and solving this
﻿this is module three of chapter one in this module we are going to discuss
in last section we have discussed about the solvability of a pfaffian differential equation
in three variables that means if a differential equation is given we can
check whether that equation is solvable or not using the necessary and sufficient condition
of solvability but, how to find the integral of that differential equation is not discussed
so, right now we are going to discuss different methods for solving a pfaffian
differential equation in three variables now, we are going to discuss different methods
for solving a pfaffian differential equation in three variables before discussing
different methods we are assuming the condition of integrability is satisfied for all the equations
the method one is by inspection so, in this method we have to find the integral by inspection
so, let us take one example so, in this example we need to solve the equation
with two variables and pfaffian differential equation with more than two variables
which is given here, so first of all we check the integrability condition of this equation
so x dot curl x become zero, therefore, the given equation is integrable now,
if we look at the equation then it can be written in this form total differential of some function
d of z plus xyz plus x plus dy by y minus d of y plus z by y plus z equals to zero
so, after integrating we get the integral of the given equation like this,
y into z plus x equals to c into y plus z where c is the arbitrary constant
now, we shall discuss method two which is separation of variables so this is a special case
this form it is easy to find the integral, after integrating the equation we can get the integral
so, we shall discuss the equation taking two variables separately and later on we shall
plus two zx dy minus three xy dz equals to zero so, first of all we have to check
whether this equation is integrable or not so, if we use the integrability condition
that means x dot curl x it becomes zero for this given equation and if we look at this equation
the function px, the coefficient of dx, the coefficient of dy and coefficient of dz can
be separable if the equation is divided by x, y and z, so dividing the given equation by x, y and
z it becomes dx by x, two dy by y, minus three dz by z equals to zero so, after integrating
we get an integral xy square equals to cz cube where c is the integrating constant
this is method three in method three only one variable is separable, so for this case
without any loss of generality we assume that the coefficient of dx is only function of x and
discuss a pfaffian differential equation taking three variables
q and r are function of y and z only so, for this case to become integrable this system,
the integrability condition should be satisfied so, if we use the integrability condition
px dx plus d psi equals to zero so, after integrating we can get the integral
easily, so this is the solution or primitive of the given equation to illustrate
that we are taking one example, y square minus z square, x square minus one dx minus two zx dy
plus two xydz equals to zero first of all we have to check the integrability of this equation,
so for that we computed this x dot curl x this is zero, for this example,
therefore the given equation is integrable and the given equation can be written
in the form x minus one by xdx minus two dyz by y by z whole square minus one
so, after integrating we can find the integral very easily and this is the integral
of the given equation where c is an arbitrary constant
now, this is method four in this method four we are assuming that the function
pqr are homogenous function of x, y and z and they are of same degree n
so, for a homogenous function if we substitute this y is equal to u into x and z equals to
v into x, the equation becomes this and we can say that the variable x become separable
an integral, therefore it is possible to find the integral for this case
we shall take one example to illustrate the idea of homogenous equation
q x y dy equals to zero and this equation can be written in the form dy dx equals to f x y
so, this is a homogenous equation in x, y, z and they are of, it is of degree three
and x dot curl x after simplification is zero hence, the given equation satisfies the
integrability condition therefore, we can look for an integral of the given equation
now, if we look at the expression for p, q and r, these are functions of x, y, z
and of degree three not only function, they are homogenous function
of degree three so, the substitution we need to make y is equal to ux and z equals to vx
so, if you substitute this that means now we are changing the equation from x, y, z to x, u, v,
where f x y equals to minus p by q now, the equation three is defined that means the
is also integrable and after integrating we get the integral y cube plus z x square equals to cx
and this is the fifth method, method of reduction in this method we assume that one of
it has the integral phi, phi xy equals to c and here c is independent of x and y but c may
to clear that idea we are taking one example, this is the example x y square minus a square dx
plus y x square minus z square dy minus z y square minus a square dz equals to zero
first we take y as a constant, so if you take y as a constant then the term this term dy become zero,
so the equation becomes x y square minus a square dx minus z y square minus s square dz
function f is defined if a p and q are defined therefore, the equation dy dx equals to f x y
equals to zero or in other words x dx minus z dz equals to zero
and this equation is integrable, we can find easily the integral of this equation as x
square minus z square so in this case phi xz is x square minus z square equals to c,
but you have to remember that this c is independent of x and z but it may depend on y,
so phi xz is equal to c, c is function of y so, if you take the differential of phi
then it will be like this, and if we compare this with the given equation
equals to zero and it is very easy to solve, so after integrating we will get
relation like this c into y square minus a square is equal to c dash and we also have
x square minus z square equals to c so, if we substitute the value of c here,
can be defined in particular if p and q are single valued function then f is also
x square minus z square so this equals to c dash by y square minus a square,
or in other words the integral can be written in this form, x square minus z square into y square minus a
square equals to c dash so, this is the required integral or solution of the given equation
and the last method is the method of auxiliary equation in this equation we
try to find or we try to write an equation, auxiliary equation to find the solution of the
pfaffian differential equation so, if this is our given equation
and if we assume this is integrable then it should satisfy the condition
grad dot curl x equals to zero and this condition leads to the equation
y minus del q del x equals to zero now, x dot dr equals to zero gives the
a single valued function so, for that case the equation three can be solved easily and
equation pdx plus qdy plus rdz equals to zero so, if we compare these two equations
del p del y minus del q del x respectively and this equation is called auxiliary equation
so, in this procedure from a pfaffian differential equation we are constructing an auxiliary equation
which is a simultaneous equation now, using the methods of solving a simultaneous equation
we shall try to find the integral of the pfaffian differential equation
z plus x square dy minus xy in to x plus y dz equals to zero so, first of all we have to verify
the condition of integrability of this equation so x is this and grad of x is this, so x dot
curl x is equal to zero for this equation so, it implies that this equation is
if we take the initial condition as y is equal to y zero at x equals to x zero,
about pfaffian differential equation first we shall define pfaffian differential equation
integrable, so it is possible to find the integral surface of the given equation now, the auxiliary
equation becomes this, now this is a simultaneous equation and we have already read how to find
solution of a simultaneous equation in earlier module so, in this equation we can solve taking
this three equation in this way, this is the one integral, x plus y into z equals to constant
and x y minus z equals to constant, this is the another integral of this simultaneous equation,
therefore these two equation together implies the equation solution of this
equation, simultaneous equation so, this is the solution of the given pfaffian
differential equation in module three of chapter one, we learned pfaffian differential equation,
we have established the necessary and sufficient condition for solvability for a pfaffian
differential equation and we have also discussed six different methods for solving a pfaffian
then the solution of three is a curve which passes through the point x zero y zero
differential equation in three variables in this way we end this module and chapter one
so, the general solution of the equation three can be considered as a one parameter family of curves
in xy plane which is given by phi x y equals to c, where c is a constant
now, i shall discuss how to find the integral of the pfaffian differential equation with two variables
let, phi x y equals to c is an integral or solution of the equation three
then, the p expression pdx plus qdy can be written as d of phi
now, if we expand d of phi we will get del phi del x dx plus del phi del y dy equals to zero
so, if we compare this equation with pdx plus qdy, we will get the relation
one by p del phi del x equals to one by q del phi del y equals to mu, which is function of x and y
and this function mu is called an integrating factor of the differential equation
and then we shall establish the necessary and sufficient condition for solvability of a pfaffian
mu xy so that the expression mu pdx plus qdy equals to an exact differential d phi
and we can establish that for two variables
if pfaffian differential equation always possesses an integrating factor
now, we are going to discuss about a pfaffian differential equation in three variables
equation five is a general form of a pfaffian differential equation in three variables
and dr is equals to dx, dy, dz there is a lemma, a necessary and sufficient
condition for the existence of a relation of the form f u, v equals to zero between two functions
differential equation and lastly we shall discuss various methods to solve these type of equations
this lemma can be proved very easily if anyone is interested to see the proof of this lemma,
they can go through the study material of this lecture now, there is another lemma,
let x be a vector function of x, y, z and mu is a function of x, y, z then
mu x dot curl of mu x equals to zero if and only if x dot curl of x equals to zero
and this lemma is also can be proved very easily and this proof is given also in study material
and these two lemmas are very important to prove the theorem which is stated here and this theorem
is very important in the sense that it says about the necessary and sufficient condition
for the pfaffian differential equation to be integrable so, a pfaffian differential equation
x dot dr equals to zero if this condition is satisfied, x dot curl of x equals to zero
now, we are going to prove this theorem we shall first prove the necessary part of
so, let us go to the first slide of module three of chapter one
this theorem, that means we are first assuming that the pfaffian differential equation x dot dr
plus del phi del z dz equals to zero and if we compare this equation with the given
equation we will get a relation between pqr and the function phi and this is the relation among
them mu p equals to del phi del dx, mu q equals to del phi del y and mu r equals to del phi del z
so, mu x can be written as gradient of the function phi now, if we take curl of mu x
that gives zero, therefore mu x dot, curl of mu x equals to zero now, if we recall
lemma two, it says that if mu x dot curl mu x equals to zero, it
first of all i am defining pfaffian differential equation in this first slide
implies x dot curl of x equals to zero so, using that lemma we can conclude
that x dot curl x equals to zero therefore, the necessary part of this theorem is proved
curl x equals to zero and we have to proof that x dot dr equals to zero is integrable
so, to prove that first we assume that z is a constant, then the given differential equation
a pfaffian differential equation with two variable always possesses an integrating factor,
therefore, there exists an integrating factor mu such that this expression pdx plus qdx will become
total differential of some function so, let mu is our integrating factor
so, if we multiply this equation by mu then we can write the equation in this form where mu p
in equation one sum of fi dxi is called the pfaffian differential
equals to del phi del x mu q equals to del phi del y and the equation becomes in this form
now, this part del phi del x dx, now think z is not a constant, so if we take z as a variable
then this part del phi del x dx plus del phi del y dy plus del phi del z dz can be written as d of
phi and the rest part is written in this form, psi into dz equals to zero where psi is the function,
mu r minus del phi dz now, mu into x it becomes
del phi del x del phi del y del phi del z plus psi, so it can be written in this form,
that means del phi del x del phi del y del phi del z plus psi dot
del psi del y minus del psi del x zero, it becomes jacobian of phi and psi with respect to x and y
and the equation sum of fi dxi equals to zero is called a pfaffian differential equation
we can write that mu x dot curl of mu x equals to zero
therefore, this jacobian del phi psi, del xy equals to zero again if we use lemma one,
phi and z therefore the equation eight becomes d phi dx plus psi phi z equals to zero so, we have
to remember that this psi is now only function of phi and z again this is a pfaffian differential
phi, capital phi phi z equals to c now, replacing phi by its expression in terms of
of the given differential equation x dot dr equals to zero or in other words we can say
that the pfaffian differential equation x dot dr equals to zero is integrable
here, fi is function of n variables x one, x two and x n
therefore, assuming the condition x dot curl of x equals to zero we arrive to the conclusion that x
now, we want to apply this theorem to prove the solvability of a given pfaffian
differential equation the equation is given in this form, yz plus z square dx minus zx dy
plus xy dz equals to zero we have to prove that this equation is integrable
x dot curl of x if becomes after simplification zero hence the condition
x dot curl x equals to zero is satisfied so, using the necessary and sufficient condition
of the previous theorem we can say that the given differential equation is integrable
there is a fundamental difference between a pfaffian differential equation
﻿now, we are going to start chapter two this chapter is devoted to first-order partial
xyz pq equals to zero from the given differential equation one can eliminate p and q from the
equation capital f equals to zero del f del p equals to zero and del f del q equals to zero
and that equation is the singular solution of the given differential equation
now, let us take one example, z square into p square plus q square plus one equals to c
square where c is a constant and we have to prove that this is x minus a whole square plus y minus b
whole square plus z square equals to c square is a complete integral of the given equation
and we have to find also singular integral and the general integral assuming b equals to a
so, the given relation is x minus a whole square plus y minus b whole square plus z square minus
c square equals to zero so, if we differentiate it partially with respect to a and b we will get
the relation x minus a equals to zero and y minus b equals to zero or a equals to x, b equals to y
in mathematical physics, chemistry, etcetera, in different fields and
from this two equation if we eliminate a and b from the equation f xyz ab equals to zero
we will get the solution z equals to plus minus c and this equation is a
singular solution of the given equation alternatively one can find this singular solution
from the given differential equation capital f xyz pq equals to z square p square plus q
square plus one minus c square equals to zero so, if you differentiate partially
with respect to p and q we get p equals to zero and q equals to zero so, if you substitute
the values of p and q in the given equation, we will find a solution z equals to plus minus c
this is a singular solution and we are getting the same singular solution
which we have obtained by eliminating a and b from the general solution
now, we are interested to find the general solution
this is easy to handle moreover, the concept of first order differential equation
making b is equal to a, so the equation becomes x minus a whole square plus y minus a whole square
plus z square minus c square equals to zero now, differentiating this
minus y whole square plus z square minus c square equals to zero so, this solution
is the required general solution or general integral of the given first order equation
now, we are going to establish a function and relation between two first order partial
differential equation under which these two equations are compatible
suppose we have two first order partial differential equations, capital f xyz
pq equals to zero and capital g xyz pq equals to zero now, these two systems
is useful to understand or study the higher order partial differential equation
are said to be compatible if a solution of the former satisfies the latter and conversely
zero that means we can find the solution for p and q from the equation twelve
and it is possible provided it satisfies the sufficient condition of integrability that means
now, differentiating the first equation of twelve that means capital f equals to zero we get
so now, we are going to start module one and we are going to our first slide of module one
now, multiplying the first equation by one and the second equation by p and then if we add
differentiating the function capital g with respect to x and z in the similar way we can find
a relation which is written in fourteen b now, if we eliminate
px plus p p z from equations to fourteen a and fourteen b we will get a relation
from this equation one can find the value of qx plus pq z
which is written in fifteen a, so the value of qx plus pq z is one by j,
we have classified a general partial differential equation in chapter one now,
with respect to the variable p and q similarly,
and using these expressions if you substitute those in equation number thirteen
that means if we put the values of qx plus pq z and py plus qp z
we will obtain a functional relation between the function f and g which is written here
so, if the function f and g satisfies this relation we can say that these two systems
are compatible, that means the solution of the function f satisfies the equation g and the
we want to do this classification in the context of first order partial differential equation
to explain the procedure more clearly so, this is one example
so, there are two given first-order partial differential equations we have to prove their
in this way the box fg
the expression which is written here, so where capital f is given and capital g is given
so, if you compute this we will get the value of box fg equals to zero
x y equals to zero are compatible systems therefore, in module one of chapter two we have
given some basic ideas about first order partial differential equation first we classified a
the general form of a first order differential equation in two variables can be written
first-order differential equation, then we have discussed the origin of a first-order
differential equations we have defined different type of solutions like general solutions,
complete solutions and singular solutions and lastly we have discussed about the compatibility
in standard notation zx is denoted by small p and zy is denoted by small
q so, equation one is written as f xyz pq equals to zero
differential equation the entire chapter is divided into five modules, in module one,
in the similar way one can define a first-order partial differential equation in three variables
xy u in this form which is written in equation number three here,
form of a first-order linear differential equation is given by equation number four,
zx and zy and a quasi linear equation is defined as a differential equation
where the coefficients of p and q are function of xy and z
so, the general form can be written in this way which is given in equation number five
we shall discuss about some basic ideas of first-order partial differential equation
so, this is one of the example of quasi linear equation x into z minus two y square p plus y
into z minus y square minus two x square q equals to z into z minus y square minus two x
square and z p plus q plus nz square equals to zero this is also a quasi linear equation
and the next type of equation is semi-linear equation so, in the general form of a semi-linear
first-order equation the coefficient of p and q are function of only independent variables
x and y, but in case of quasi linear equation a and b may be function of the dependent variable
z so, this is one of the example of semi-linear equation
so, in both the equation the coefficient of p and q are function of x and y only
and the most complicated type is the nonlinear equation
where the equation does not belongs to any of the three types which we have described already
in module two, we shall discuss about first order quasi linear partial differential equation,
so, these are the examples of nonlinear equation pq plus q cube equal to three pq, q plus xp equals
to p square now, i am going to discuss the origin of a first-order partial differential equation
that means from which problem a first order differential equation comes and
what is the relation between a first order differential equation and its solution
in this regards i want to mention that in case of ordinary differential equation if there is a one
parameter system of curves, then it corresponds to a first-order ordinary differential equation
in case of two parameter family of curves, we get a second-order ordinary differential equation
now, we are going to discuss is that any relation like that in case of partial
differential equation so, to get that answer let us go to the next slide suppose we have a
in module three, we shall discuss about nonlinear first-order partial differential equation
and q equals to del z del y now, from these two equations
if you eliminate a and b and substitute the values of a and b in equation seven, you will
let us take one example to explain it clearly x minus a whole square plus y minus b whole
square plus z square equals to one it represents a system of spheres with center at a b zero
now, if we differentiate that equation with respect to a, x and y we will get the relation x
and in module four, we shall discuss about the charpit’s methods and jacobi's methods
minus a plus zp equals to zero and y minus b plus zq equals to zero from these two equations we can
find the values of a and b and if you substitute these values of a and b in the original equation,
we will get a relation of the form z square into p square plus q square
plus one equals to one so, this is the first order differential equation whose
solution is x minus a whole square plus y minus b whole square plus z square equals to one
so, in this case eliminating two arbitrary constants a and b we obtain a first-order
y and z where z is the dependent variable which is function of x and y
and the function u and v are related by the relation phi u v equals to zero
for solving a first-order differential equation and in last module we shall discuss
which are written here now, from these two equations we can eliminate
zx q equals to del u v del xy or in other words capital p small p plus capital q small q equals
to capital r where capital p capital q capital r has the expressions which are written in equation
a first order differential equation by eliminating the arbitrary function phi
to explain the above procedure we are taking this example
let z is some function of xy by small z now, from this equation if we differentiate it with
about solution of a first-order differential equation satisfying some given conditions
so, from these two equations we get the value of p by q in this form that means
in the above two equation if we eliminate f dash x, then we will get a relation
in the form px minus qy equals to zero and this is a first order differential equation
so, in this case eliminating the function f we are getting a first order differential equation
now, we will explain what is the difference between the solutions of a first-order
differential equation in the first case we have shown that a first-order differential equation
can be obtained by eliminating two arbitrary constants a and b from a given function f
xyz ab equal to zero and so this is the solution of a first-order differential equation and
this solution is known as complete solution or complete integral
first of all let me explain, what why should we read first-order partial differential equation
a first order differential equation therefore a solution of the type phi u v
equals to zero is called a general solution of the given equation
there is another way to find general solution in which we find the locus of a parametric family of
curves which is called the characteristic of the envelope of the family <?>f xyz f psi a</?> equals
to zero where b is supposed to be a function of a now, we shall illustrate all this concept
using taking one example so, before explaining that example let us discuss about a singular
solution this is another type of solution in which case we eliminate a from the equation
small f equals to zero and del f del a equals to zero and del f del b equals to zero
and there is another way to find singular solution from the given differential equation capital f
the first order differential equation is important because this type of equation arises
﻿now, i am going to teach module two of chapter two
cosines of the normal to the surface therefore, this capital p capital q
capital r represent the direction ratios of some straight line which is perpendicular to the normal
to the surface to the integral surface of the quasi linear equation
therefore, the straight line having direction ratios pq r represent the tangent to the given surface
suppose a particle starts from a point capital n and move in the direction p q capital r, then
the curve prescribed by the particle lies on the surface and for a given particular point in the
values of p q r is unique therefore, it represent that from through a given fixed point capital m,
the integral there is only integral, one integral curve passes through that given point
therefore, the integral curve of dx by p equals to dy by q equals to dz by r
lies entirely on the integral surface of p p plus q q equals to r
which is function of xy and z is equal to c one and v which is function of xy and z is equal to
or in other words one can say that the integral curves of the simultaneous equation generate
the integral surface of the given quasi linear equations p p plus q q equals to r so, this is
the geometrical interpretation of a quasi linear first order partial differential equation
which is the solution of the simultaneous equation and those curves are called characteristic curves
so, how can we obtain the equation of a characteristic curve? suppose the equation
of a characteristic curves is given in parametric form that means xy and z can
be written as some function of parameter, a parameter small t, then the tangent vector
to this curve is dx dt, dy dt and dz dt since the tangent vectors, the direction ratios
of the tangent vector is proportional to capital p capital q capital r, so dx dt must be equals to
c two are solution of the simultaneous equation dx by capital p equals to dy by capital q equals
capital p, dy dt must be equals to capital q and dz dt must be equals to capital r, so equation
three gives the equation of the characteristic curves of the quasi linear equation one
in the last section we have learned how to find solution of a quasi linear partial differential
equation now we shall use that concept to solve some geometrical problems especially we shall
find the integral surface passing through a given curve and we shall obtain or learn how
to find the system of integral surface which is perpendicular to a given system of surfaces
now, i am going to discuss how to find integral surface passing through a given curve
suppose we have a quasi linear equation p p plus q q equals to capital r
and u equals to c one and v equals to c two are the solution of the lagrange
auxiliary equation dx by p equals to dy by q equals to dz by r
so, the solution of the quasi linear equation p p plus q q plus q q equals to r
is phi uv equals to zero and we are interested to find the integral surface through the curve gamma,
the equation of gamma is given in parametric form, xyz are some function of parameter t,
so u equals to c one and v equals to c two are solution of the curve, therefore, uxt yt
zt equals to c one and v xt yt zt equals to ct and where t is the parameter and from these above two
equation one can eliminate t to find a relation of the form phi c one c two equals to zero
therefore, our desired solution or the general solution of the given quasi linear equation
is phi u v equals to zero now, i shall illustrate this idea taking one example,
suppose we want to find the integral surface of the quasi linear equation two y z minus
three into p plus two x minus z q equals to y into two x minus three and the integral surface which
so, in this theorem we can see that the solution of the quasi linear equation
passes through the circle z equals to zero x square plus y square equals to two x
now, the auxiliary equation for the given equation
can be written as dx by this equals to dy by this equals to dz by
as x square minus three x minus z square plus six z equals to c one where c one is a constant
and the another integral can be found easily dx plus two into y dy minus dz equals to zero
after integrating v is x plus y square minus two z equals to c two where c two being constant
therefore, the general solution of the given quasi linear equation is phi
u v equals to zero where the expressions for u and v we have already derived, so phi of
x square minus three x minus z square plus six z comma x plus y square minus two z equals to zero
p p plus q q equals to r is involved with the solution of the simultaneous
so, this is the general solution or the integral surface of the given quasi linear equation
now, we are interested to find that integral surface which passes through the given circle
now, the equation of the circle can be written in parametric form as x equals to one plus cos t,
y equals two sin t, z equals to zero and if we substitute this parametric form to the one
integral u equals to c one it becomes one plus cos t square minus three into one plus cos t
equals to c one and v equals to c two, it gives one plus cos t plus sin square t equals
to c two now, from these two equation one can eliminate t and get the relation
two plus c one plus c two equals to zero therefore the equation of the required surface is
two plus x square minus three x minus z square plus six z plus x plus y square minus two z
equals to zero and this relation is obtained from two plus c one plus c two equals to zero
equation which is given in equation one now, we shall first prove this theorem,
and substituting the values of c one and c two, so after simplification this is the required equation
of the surface x square plus y square minus z square minus two x plus four z equals to zero
now, we shall develop an idea where we shall discuss how to find
the system of surfaces which are orthogonal to a given system of surface
suppose there is a one parameter system of surfaces and this system is given by equation
are proportional to del f del x del f del y del f del z, that we have already know
orthogonally, then the normal to this surface z equals to f xy which are proportional to del z
del x del z del y minus one must be perpendicular to del f del x, del f del y, del f del z so,
then we shall apply this theorem to solve some mathematical problems
using the condition of perpendicularity, we can obtain a relation del f del x into del z del x
plus del f del y into del z del y plus del f del z into minus one equals to zero
or in other words or with this notation capital p small p plus capital q small q equals to capital r
where pqr assumed as del f del x del f del y and del f del z and we are interested to find the
values of p q that means now we obtain a quasi linear equation which is given in equation six
and we want to find the solution of the quasi linear equation six
and we already know that the solution of the quasi linear equation is related to the solution
of a simultaneous equation which is known as the lagrange auxiliary equation and this is written in
equation number seven dx by del f del x equals to dy by del f del y equals to dz by del f del z
so, solution of the equation seven will give the solution of the
now, u equals to xyz equals to c one is a solution of equation one, therefore, if you take the total
quasi linear equation which is written in six and that will be our required system of surfaces
which are orthogonal to the given system of surfaces which is written in equation number five
now, we shall illustrate the idea taking one simple example so, let us take this
example we have to find the equation of system of surfaces which cut orthogonally the cones of
system x square plus y square plus z square equals to c xy where c is a parameter
so, the auxiliary equation for the system of surfaces which are orthogonal
to the given surface is dx by del f del x equals to dy by del f del y equals to dz by del f del z
so, if we know the expression for capital f, so if we substitute these values,
we obtain the simultaneous equation which is written here
and from this simultaneous equation one can obtain easily two integrals so one integral
differential of u you will get the relation ux dx plus uy dy plus uz dz equals to zero
is x square plus y square plus z square equals to c one and another integral is x square minus
y square by z square equals to c two so, the general solution of this simultaneous
equation or not this simultaneous equation, the general solution of the quasi linear equation
is phi x square plus y square plus z square comma x square minus y square by z square equals to zero
or in explicit form, in explicit form one can write equation in this form
x square plus y square plus z square equals to f of x square minus y square by z square
now, we shall take another example to make the concept more clear
so, in this example we have to find the surfaces which intersect the given system of surfaces z
into x plus y equals to c into three z plus one where c is the arbitrary constant
that means we have to find the system of surfaces which cut this given system of
and we also have that u equals to c one is the solution of the simultaneous equation one
this module is devoted to the theory of first order quasi linear partial differential equation
surfaces orthogonally and we have to find that surfaces which passes through the
circle x square plus y square equals to one and z equals to one
so, let us first try to find the system of orthogonal surfaces so, for that
first the given system of surfaces can be written in this form f xyz is from the given system of
surfaces if we divide the left-hand side by three z plus one, we obtain f xyz as z into x plus y,
divided by three z plus one equals to c, where c is the parameter
so, if we vary the parameter c we will get a system of surfaces now, the auxiliary equation
for the orthogonal system of surfaces is given by dx by del f del x equals to dy by del f del y
equals to dz by del f del z now, substituting the values of f from here, we can obtain the equations
in this simplified form dx by z equals to dy by z equals to three z plus one into dz by dx plus y
therefore, this equation ux dx plus uy dy plus uz dz equals to zero and
and from this equation one can obtain two integrals easily, one is dx minus dy equals
to zero, that means after integrating we will get one integral x minus y equals to constant
and some manipulation of this equation will give the another integral
so that can be obtained from this equation x plus y into dx plus y minus six z square
plus two z into dz equals to zero therefore one integral is u which is x
minus y equals to c one and the another integral is v which is equals to x minus y whole square
minus two z square into two z plus one equals to c two here c one c two are arbitrary constant
now, we want to find that integral surface which passes through the given circle
now, the parametric equation of the given circle can be written in this form x equals to cos t,
y is equals to sin t, z equals to one so, if we substitute xyz, from this equation u equals
the simultaneous equation one are compatible to each other
to c one, we obtain this relation cos t minus sin t equals to c one and if we substitute the
values of xyz in the second integral v equals to c two, we obtain the another relation cos t
plus sin t square minus six equals to c two that is sin two t equals to, so from these two
equation if we manipulate one can obtain the value of sin two t as one minus c one square
and from the second equation the value of sin two t can be obtained as five plus c two so,
from these two equation we can eliminate t to obtain a relation between the constant c one
and c two, like c one square plus c two plus four equals to zero now, if we substitute the
values of c one c two, where c one is x minus y and c two is written here the expression for v,
so if you substitute those values we can obtain a function relation like this
so, this x square plus y square after simplification we get that function as
now, from the earlier site, since dx dy dz are proportional to p q r, so from this equation we
x square plus y square equals to two z cube plus z square minus two so,
this is our required integral that means this is the system of integral surfaces which are
orthogonal to the given system of surfaces and it also passes through the given circle
thus, in module two of chapter two we have discussed about a quasi linear first order
differential equation we have defined that equation we have derived the lagrange’s
auxiliary equation for a quasi linear equation and we discuss about the geometrical interpretation
of that quasi linear equation and lastly we apply the idea of solving a quasi linear differential
equation to solve some geometrical problems so, in this way we end this module of chapter two
in the similar way taking v is equal to xyz as a solution of the equation
dx by p equals to dy by q equals to dz by r, we can obtain the similar relation
we will get p divided by del uv del yz equals to q divided by del uv del zx equals to r divided by
del uv del xy now, we have already seen in module one of this chapter that the relation phi uv
equals to zero leads to the partial differential equation p del uv del yz plus q del uv del zx
we shall show that the solution of a first-order quasi linear partial differential equation
and this equation is known as the equation, this equation means,
the equation one is known as lagrange auxiliary equation, so we obtain that phi uv equals to zero
is a solution of the quasi linear equation p p plus q q equals to r, where this u and v are the
solution of the simultaneous equation one, which is known as lagrange’s auxiliary equation
now, we shall apply the previous theorem to solve this mathematical problem
in this example we have to find the general integral of this quasi linear equation
now, we can write this equation in standard form as this, some function of xyz
into p and this is a function of xyz into q equals to some function of xy and z
is linked with the solution of a simultaneous equation and that simultaneous equation is
capital q equals to dz by capital r, here capital p is the coefficients of small p for this example
it is small x into z minus two y square and capital q is the coefficient of small q,
which is for this example, y into z minus y square minus two x cube and capital r is z into z minus y
square minus two x cube now, it is easy to find the solution of these simultaneous equation,
if we observe this equation carefully, we can see that from last two equations one can find
the solution easily like this dy by y equals to dy by z and solving this equation one can obtain
y is equal to c one into z therefore, one can take
an integral of the simultaneous equation u is equal to y by z equals to c one now, we need
to find another integral of the simultaneous equation that means the function v, for that
known as lagrange’s auxiliary equation we shall give the geometrical interpretation
we need some manipulation of the simultaneous equation so, we have done some mathematical
formulas, we have manipulate this equation and we obtain an equation like this which is written here
dx by x equals to d into y square minus z divided by y square minus z plus two x cube equals to dw
so, our another integral is x square minus w by x equals to constant that equals to c two now,
substituting the value of w from here that means putting the value of w as y square minus z,
we will obtain the value or the expression for v xyz as x square plus z by x minus y
square by x square equals to c two therefore, the general integral is phi of uv equals to zero where
u is y by z and v is x square plus z by x minus y square by x square equals to zero
of a first-order quasi linear equation and lastly we shall use these concepts
so, in this example we find that the solution of the quasi linear equation can be obtained
from the solution of the corresponding auxiliary equation and it is easy to find the solution
of quasi linear equation from the solution of auxiliary equation now, now the previous idea can
be extended for n number of independent variables and the corresponding theorem is stated here,
if ui x one x two x n z equals to c i where i equals to one to n, vn independent solution of the
ci’s are the constants and pi’s are functions of the independent variables
x one x two xn and the dependent variable z and z is the function of x one x two xn
and capital r is function of n independent variables and the dependent variable z
so, the solution of the ui’s are the solution of the simultaneous equation four then the
to give or to solve some geometrical problems so, let us go to the first slide of this module
solution of the quasi linear equation which is written in equation number five, p one p one plus
p two p two plus pn pn equals to r is given by phi of u one u two u n equals to zero,
where these pi’s in equation number five, small pi's are the derivative of the dependent
variable z with respect to the independent variable xi i equals to one two up to n
now, we illustrate the idea for taking this example in this example
there are three independent variables xyz and one dependent variable u so, this is a first order
quasi linear differential equation and we have to solve this equation so, the corresponding
lagrange auxiliary equation is dx by u plus y plus z this is the function which is coefficient of del
this is coefficient of del u del z equals to du by x plus y plus z
now, i am going to state an important theorem which says that
and from this equation, simultaneous equation one can find easily three integrals since there
are three independent variables for the general solution we need three integrals
so, from this equation one can obtain three integrals as
x minus y by y minus z equals to c one and the another integral y minus z by z minus u equals
to c two and x plus y plus z plus u to the power one-third into z minus u equals two c
three therefore, the required general solution of the given equation can be written in the form
some function of u one u two u three equals to zero so, this is our required solution
now, i want to give geometrical interpretation of a quasi linear first order differential equation
that means the equation capital p small p plus capital q small q equals to r
i want to give how the solution of a quasi linear first order differential equation is what related
the quasi linear first-order partial differential equation capital p small p plus capital q small q
to a solution of simultaneous equation and what is the geometrical meaning of this relation
so, let us first take that z is equal to fxy
is an integral surface of the given quasi linear equation p p plus qq equals to capital r
now, if we write the equation of the surface, integral surface in the form, in implicit form
like f xyz minus f xy minus z equals to zero, then the direction cosines of the normal to the surface
can be written as del z del x del z del y minus one and with the standard notation we can write
look at the given equation, p p plus q q equals to capital r and this equation can be written in this
way capital p small p plus capital q into small q plus capital r into minus one equals to zero
now, if you observe these small p small q's minus one this is the direction
equals to capital r has the general solution phi u v equals to zero where u
﻿this is module three of chapter two this module is devoted to the theory of nonlinear
determines a plane element of the type x zero, y zero, gx zero, y zero, gx, x zero, y zero and gy,
x zero, y zero and this is called tangent element of the surface s at the point x zero, y zero,
the important theorem as which is written here, a necessary and sufficient condition for a surface
to be an integral surface of a partial differential equation is that
at each point, its tangent element should touch the elementary cone
now, we want to derive cauchy’s characteristic equations to derive that equation, we first
consider there is a curve gamma the equation of which curve is given in parametric form,
where t is the parameter so, x is some function of t, y is some function of t and z is also some
function of t and which lies on the surface s therefore it will satisfy the equation
which is written in equation two and which involve two arbitrary constants, a and b, one can derive
of the surface, so z equals to g, xt, yt, for all t belongs to some interval i
then, if p zero is a point on gamma, determined by the parameter t zero, then the direction
ratios of the tangent line p zero p one are x dash t zero, y dash t zero, z dash t zero,
where dash denote the derivative with respect to t, at the point t equals to zero, t zero
the picture of this is given in figure two, where p p zero is the tangent line to the curve gamma
now, the direction p zero q zero minus one is perpendicular to x dash, y dash, z dash
therefore, p zero x dash plus q zero y dash plus minus one z dash equals to zero so, from this
equation, one can write the value of z dash as z dash equals to p zero x dash plus q zero y dash
defines a strip at the point x, y, z of the curve gamma, as it is shown in figure two
a first order partial differential equation, which is written in equation number one
if such a strip is an integral element of the
equation one, equation one means the equation capital f x, y, z, p, q equals to zero, then
that strip is called the integral strip of the given equation
the condition six and the condition f x, y, z, p, q equals to zero for all t belongs to i
now, we are in the position of finding solution
of a cauchy problem if at each point the curve gamma touches a generator of elementary cone,
then the corresponding strip is called characteristic strip so, let there is a
point neighboring to the point x, y, z and having coordinates x plus dx, y plus dy, z plus dz,
it lies on the tangent plane to the elementary cone, then dz must be equals to p dx plus q dy,
so, starting from equation two, we can go to equation one and conversely one can prove that
where p, q satisfy the equation one equation one means the given equation
dq dp equals to zero and from equation eight, if we differentiate the equation with respect to
which is written in nine so, eliminating dq dp,
or putting the value of dq dp from the first equation to the second,
we can get a relation between dx and dy now, the equation eight and nine are compatible
so from eight and nine, we can derive the dx, dy and dz are proportional to fp, fq
and pfp plus qfq respectively along the characteristic strip now, we choose the parameter
the solution of a first order equation, which is written in equation one
so, along the characteristic strip p is also function of the parameter t
and that function can be obtained in this way, if you take p dash t, compute p dash t, it is
del p del x dx dt plus del p del y dy dt now, substituting the values of x dash t and y
dash t, we get this equals to del p del x del f del p plus del p del y del f del q
now, the value of del q del x is equals to the value of del p del y,
which is proved here the value of del p del y can be written as del two z, del y del x
now, if we interchange the order of the derivative,
we get del two z, this equals to del two z del x del y and which is nothing but del q del x
so, in the previous equation we have used the relation del p del y equals to del q del x
thus, we obtain the value of p dash t is this now, if we substitute,
is of the form, which is written in equation two now, i shall define again,
now if we differentiate equation number seven with respect to x, equation number seven means
the given equation, differential equation p, where all the variables x, y, z, p, q are function of t
so, if we differentiate equation number seven, we will get with respect to x,
we will get a relation in this form and here, if we use the relation,
if we use the value of p dash t as del f del p del p del x plus del f del q del q del x,
we obtain a relation, or rather we can find the value of p dash t as minus of fx plus p fz
in the similar way, we can find the value of q dash t as minus of fy plus qfz now,
in equation number eleven and this equation is known as cauchy’s characteristic equations
and there is an important theorem which says that, if a characteristic strip contains at least one
various type of solution of a nonlinear partial differential equation
integral element of f x, p, q equals to zero, then it is an integral strip of this equation
now, we are interested to find the integral of a given equation, nonlinear equation
which passes through a given curve gamma
thus, we are interested to find the solution of capital f equals to zero and which passes through
gamma and the equation of gamma is written in parametric form, small x is some function
of zeta, y is some function of zeta and z is some function of zeta
and we know that for a given equation, we can find cauchy’s characteristic equation, which is set of
five ordinary first order differential equation which is written in equation number eleven so,
solution of that equation is of the type x is some function of x zero, y zero, z zero, p zero,
q zero, t zero, t similarly, all variables, y, z, p, q, they are functions of x zero, y zero,
so, we have seen in our first slide that equation two is a solution of one, involving
we are taking the given value of x from the curve which passes through the curve gamma
value of p zero, q zero can be obtained in this way, dz equals to p zero dx plus q zero dy
and z is function of chi zeta so, dz, so if you take derivative,
so chi dash zeta equals to p zero, phi dash zeta plus q zero psi dash zeta
so, we have a relation between, liner relation between p zero and q zero in the first equation
and we also have capital f which is function of phi, psi, chi, p zero, q zero equals to zero
so, solving this two equation, we can find the values of p zero and q zero therefore all the
variables, x, y, z, p, q are known in terms of x zero, y zero, z zero, p zero, q zero and t zero
two arbitrary constants a and b this solution is called complete integral of equation one
so, x, y and z, they are function of only
xi and t so, there are three relation between xi and t so, among these three relation,
we can eliminate xi and t to obtain a functional form between x, y and z
theta x, y, z equals to zero, which is written in equation number fourteen so, this is our required
general integral passing through the given curve gamma, the equation of which is known
now, we shall take one example to make the clear, to make the concept more clear
so, take this example, we have to find the characteristic of the equation pq equals to z and
to have to determine the integral surface which passes through the parabola x equals to zero, y
square equals to z so, here, capital f that means the given equation is pq minus z equals to zero
and we can immediately write down the corresponding cauchy’s characteristic equation
suppose there exist a relation between the parameters a and b of the form
which is written here, x dash t equals to fp, for this case it is capital q y dash t equals to p
and z dash t equals to two pq and p dash t is p, q dash t is q
the equation of the given curve is x equals to zero, y square equals to z so, our initial
condition is x zero equals to zero, y zero equals to zeta and z zero equals to zeta square
so, this is parametric form of the given curve
now, using this relation, z zero dash equals to p zero x zero dash plus q zero y zero dash
we can obtain the value y zero dash is one so, substituting these values, we can find the
the values of p zero q zero in the given equation, we can obtain the value of p zero as
first order partial differential equation we have already defined different type of integrals
zeta by two now, we have five equations, x dash t equals to q, q dash t equals to q,
and x, so from these two equation, we can find a relation between x and q as x equals to q plus c
one and also y dash equals to p, p dash equals to p, we obtain a relation y is equal to p plus
c two where c one, c two are constants so, using the initial conditions one can obtain
a relation between x and q as x equals to q minus two zeta and y is equal to p plus zeta by two
but in this equation, we also have p zero t equals to p and q dash equals to q
so, it gives p as c three e to the power t, and after integrating we similarly get q is equal to
c four e to the power t and the values of c three, c four can be obtained using the
initial value so, these values become zeta by two and c four two zeta
so, we get the value of p as zeta by two e to the power t and value of q as two zeta e to
zero is also a solution of the given equation and the envelope of this one parameter system
the power t so, we get x is some function of x and zeta, y is also some function of x and zeta
so, from these two equation, we can find value of e to the power t, which is written here and
value of zeta which is some function of x and y, which is also written here
but, we need to apply the differential equation for z, which is z dash t equals to two pq so,
if you substitute the values of p and q, and after integrating we get z equals to zeta square
e to the power two t, where we have used the initial condition z zero equals to zeta square
at t equals to zero now, in this expression, if we substitute the value of zeta and e to the power
t from the previous slide, we obtain z as some function of x and y, which is written
here sixteen z equals to x plus four y whole square
so, this is our required integral, so this is our required integral which passes through the
constitute a solution of the given equation one, and that solution is known as general integral
given parabola and the equation x equals to two zeta e to the power t minus one, y is
equal to zeta by two e to the power t plus one and z equals to zeta square e to the power two
these are the cauchy’s characteristic curve we know that, a nonlinear partial differential
equation is very difficult to solve compared to a linear and quasi linear differential equation
in this module we have discussed a geometrical way to solve a nonlinear partial first order
differential equation, which is known as cauchy’s method of characteristic
of equation one there is another type of integral which is known as singular integral and it is,
it can be obtained by considering the envelope of the two parameter system of surfaces two
so, if we calculate or evaluate the envelope of two parameter
system of surfaces two, that solution will give a singular solution of the equation one
now, we shall take one equation, one example to explain all type of solutions
we have to show that the solution of this equation is z equals to ax plus b y plus a plus b minus ab,
and which is complete integral of the given equation
of a first order differential equation in this module, we shall define different type
and we have to show, that envelope of all planes corresponding to complete integrals
provided singular integral of the differential equation and we have to determine a general
integral by find the envelope of these planes, and which also passes through origin
now, we write the function f which is the general integral in the form f x, y, z, a,
value of p in this solution is constant that means we can obtain the complete integral
to zero is a complete integral of the equation z equals to px plus qy plus p plus q minus pq
now, the envelope of this two parameter system will give the singular solution
of the given equation so, to obtain the singular solution, we solve the equation f equals to zero,
of integrals taking a nonlinear equation, first order non linear equation
del f del a equals to zero, and del f del b equals to zero
so, if we write the equations it will be in this form the first equation corresponds to f equals
to zero and the second equation corresponds to del f del a equals to zero and the third equation
corresponds to del f del b equals to zero so, from last two equation, one can obtain the values
of a and b easily and if we substitute the values of a and b in the first equation,
we will get z as function of xy which is written here as x plus one into y plus one
and this solution is the singular solution of the given equation
now, we want to find a general integral of the given equation
to find general integral, suppose a and b are related by the relation b is equal to psi a
now, from f equals to zero, if we put the value of b as psi a, we obtain a relation
and then mainly we shall discuss the cauchy’s method of characteristic, to find solution of a nonlinear
which is written in the slide and to find the general integral, we have to find the
envelope of the one parameter system which is written here so, to obtain the envelope
of one parameter system, where a is the parameter, we have to solve f equals to zero
together with del f del a equals to zero the expression for del f del a
is written here so, now we have to solve f equals to zero, del f del a equals to zero
and we have to find that integral which passes through origin so, in the previous expression,
in the expression for f, we substitute x equals to zero, y equals to zero and z equals to zero
since the integral passes through origin, we get a relation minus a minus psi a
plus a psi a equals to zero, which gives the expression for psi a as a by a minus one
and we can immediately find the value of psi dash a
first order partial differential equation so, let us go to the first slide of this module
as minus one by a minus one whole square now, we have another equation del f del a equals to zero
so, in del f del a equals to zero, if we substitute the values of psi a
and psi dash a, we can obtain a relation which is written here and from that equation,
we can find the value of a as square root of y by x plus one so, taking this value of a,
we can write down the functional form of psi as root y plus root x by root y
now, in the expression f equals to zero, if we substitute, in the expression f equals to
zero if we substitute the values of a and psi a, we obtain a function z equals to
root y root x by root y into x plus root y root x by root y into y and so on, which is written here
so, after simplification, we get equation of the integral surface or the general integral is x
plus y minus z whole square equals to four xy so, this is our general integral so, in this example,
suppose a nonlinear partial differential equation is given,
we calculate the complete integral, singular integral and the general integral
now, i am going to explain cauchy’s method of characteristic to find complete integral of a
given nonlinear first order differential equation this method is based on a geometrical idea
first of all, we shall derive the cauchy’s characteristic equations,
then using that concept we shall find general integral of a nonlinear equation passing through
a given curve so, let us go to the slide show of the cauchy’s characteristic equation
before describing cauchy’s method of characteristic,
i will give some definition of some elementary things suppose, there is a point p
having coordinates x zero, y zero, z zero and we want to draw a plane through the point p
so, one can draw infinite number of planes passing through point p so, to uniquely specify a plane,
which is written in this slide in equation number one, where capital f is function of x, y, z, p and
we need the direction ratios of the normal to the plane let, let us fix that direction
at, in the direction n which has the components p zero, q zero, minus one
suppose a plane element x zero, y zero, z zero, p zero, q zero satisfy the equation one, that means
equation one is the given partial first order differential equation
so, then the plane element is called the integral element
and the equation in equation one, we have capital f x, y, z, p, q equals to zero and from that
equation, we can obtain the value of q as some function of p, which is written in equation
three and suppose that function is g now, if we fix the point x, y, z and vary the point p,
q this small p is del z del x and small q is del z del y and capital f is a nonlinear function
we will get a set of plane elements in the form x zero, y zero, z zero, p, g x zero, y zero,
z zero p that means the set of elements are such that all the planes passes through the fix point
x zero, y zero, z zero, but the direction of the normal are different for the different planes
therefore, this set of planes envelope a cone and all this cone passes through the fix point p
and this cone is known as elementary cone of the given equation one at the point p
the picture of that elementary cone is shown here so, p is our fixed point and
a particular position of the plane element is given here, and n is the normal to the plane
now, consider a surface s, having equation z equals to g x, y, where the function g x, y and
its first order partial derivatives with respect to x and y are continuous in some defined region,
capital omega in x, y plane then the tangent plane at every point of s,
and we have already seen that if we start with a function,
this is module four of chapter two in this module, we shall discuss about two powerful
becomes dz equals to one by square root za square plus a square dx plus a by za square
plus a square dy
after integrating, we can get a relation which is written here and the last relation we obtain
after simplification function of x, y, z which is z into square root z square plus a square
plus a square log z plus square root z square plus a square equals to two into x plus ay
thus it represent a now, i am going to discuss the third type of equation where
the given equation is separable
that means suppose the given equation is capital f x, y, z, p, q equals to zero, and the equation
is said to be separable if the equation can be written in the form some phi xp equals
equals to zero which is written in equation two and in this equation there is one arbitrary
then the corresponding charpit equation becomes dx by phi p equals to dy by minus psi q equals
to dz by p psi x minus q psi y equals to dp by minus phi x equals to dq by minus psi y
and taking the first dx by phi p equals to dp by minus phi x, we can get a relation of
the form phi p dp plus phi x dx equals to zero so, after integrating we can get an
integral phi xp equals to a similarly, we can get psi yq equals to a now, we shall
so, f can be written as p square y into one plus x square minus q x square equals to zero
so, from this equation, we can separate the function of x and p on left hand side and
the right hand side a function of q and y so, let the function of x and p as phi, so
constant a is involved
phi xp is p square into one plus x square by x square, and psi yq equals to q by y
then charpit’s equations can be written in the form which is given in the slide
will get a relation between q and y as q equals to some a square y where a square is a constant
so, psi is q by y equals to a square therefore phi, since phi is equals to psi, so phi must
be equals to a square that means p square into one plus p square by x square equals
to a square so, from here one can obtain the value of p as ax by square root one plus
x square now, if you take the differential object dz and if you substitute the values
after integrating, we get z equals to a square root one minus x square plus half a square
and we also assume that we can solve equation one and two are solvable for the variables
y square plus b square so, this is the, of the given equation and the last type i want
to discuss, when the given equation is given in clairaut’s form an equation f x, y,
equals to dp by zero equals to dq by zero
so, from this equation, one can easily obtain that dp equals to zero so, it gives the solution
p equals to a constant a and q equals to another dq equals to zero gives the solution q equals
to b where a and b are constants so, if you substitute the values of p and q in equation
p and q therefore solving equation one and two, one can obtain p, as function of x, y,
where the equation is given in clairaut’s form so, this is our equation z minus px
minus qy equals to p square plus q square
so, this equation can be written in standard form as z equals to px plus qy plus p square
plus q square so, the corresponding charpit’s equations are written below dx by x plus
two q square equals to dp by zero equals to dq by zero so, solving this equation, we
can get p is equal to constant a and q is equal to constant b so, the complete integral
is z equals to ax plus by plus a square plus b square
now, i am going to discuss jacobi’s method for solving a nonlinear first order partial
differential equation in the in this course, i shall discuss the method taking two independent
z, a and similarly q as function of x, y, z and a now, consider about the total differential
variables and one dependent variable the advantage of jacobi’s method over charpit’s
variables, whereas charpit’s methods cannot be extended that much easy way for n number
of variables so, let me discuss the jacobi’s method in the first slide
suppose, if we have a nonlinear equation which is written in equation number ten, f x, y,
minus u one by u three and q, which is del z del y, can be written as minus u two by
x, y, z respectively
of the dependent variable z which is function of x and y, so it can be written as dz equals
therefore, substituting the values of p and q from equation twelve to equation ten, we
can obtain a relation of the form f x, y, z, u one, u two, u three equals to zero, which
is written in equation number thirteen now, we shall introduce another two first order
partial differential equations involving two arbitrary constants which are g equals to
zero and h equals to zero, which are written in equation number fourteen and we also assume
that equations thirteen that means the given equation here and equation fourteen
are solvable for u one, u two, u three
is integrable so, under this two assumption, we can find the solution of the given equation
now, what is the meaning of this conditions? so, if we take equation thirteen and fourteen,
so those two equations are compatible that means, the box fg equals to zero, box gh equals
to zero, box hf equals to zero now, box fg equals to zero , if you expand the box, you
del fg del z u three equals to zero
so, after expansion we will get the next line now, the auxiliary equation for this equation
can be written as dx by f u one equals to dy by f u two equals to dz by f u three equals
to d u one by minus f x equals to d u two by minus f y equals to d u three by minus
f z, which is written in equation number sixteen and this equation is known as jacobi’s equation
so, solving this jacobi’s equation, if we can get two integral, then that will solve the purpose
of solving the given equation
q so, substituting the values of p and q from the above equation, one can write the
so, if you take one example, the idea will be more clear so, let us take this example
we have to find the solution of z square equals to pqxy by jacobi’s method so, the given
relation can be written as f equals to z square minus pqxy equals to zero so, here p which
is del z del x is minus u one by u three, q is minus u two by u three so, from the
given equation if we substitute the values of p and q, we obtain small f function as
u one u two xy minus u three square z square equals to zero
and from this equation, one can get the jacobi’s equation as dx by u two xy equals to dy by
u one xy equals to dz by minus u three z square equals to d u one by minus u one u two y equals
to d u two by minus u one u two x equals to d u three by two u three square into z so,
equation three
equals to minus d u one by u one after integrating we can get u one x equals to constant, let’s
say a and taking dy and d u two, so dy by y equals to minus d u two by u two we get
another integral u two x equals to constant say b
so, from the equation f x, y, z, u one, u two, u three equals to zero, if we substitute
the values of u one, u two, that means in the equation u one u two xy minus u three
square z square equals to zero, we can obtain the value of u three as u three equals to
square root ab by z so, now we have the values of u one, u two and u three now, we have
u three dz
so, substituting the values of u one, u two and u three after integrating we get the complete
now, integrating equation three, one can get a relation of the form small f x, y, z, a,
methods, namely charpit’s method and jacobi’s method for finding solution of a nonlinear
integral as u equals to log c x to the power a y to the power b z to the power square root
ab where c is a constant so, in this way, one can obtain the complete integral of a
given equation using jacobi’s method in this module we have discussed, charpit’s
method and jacobi’s method, and how to apply these methods to find solution of a first
order partial differential equation
these two methods are very useful because this method can be applied to any type of
first order differential equation means to a linear differential equation, quasi linear
differential equation overall one can apply these methods to a nonlinear first order partial
differential equations so, this module ends here
b equals to zero and equation four is of the given equation one since it involves
in this way which is described in this slide so, in the charpit’s method, the basic assumption
is j jacobean of the function f g with respect to p and q is not equals to zero
that means, we can find the values of p and q from the relation f equals to zero and g
that means the box f g equals to zero and we have already learned that compatibility
of two functions gives the box of f g equals to zero now, if we expand this box, we obtain
partial differential equation we shall find the complete integral of a given nonlinear
we obtain this relation in chapter one now, from this equation, like lagrange’s auxiliary
equation, we can write another auxiliary equation which is known as charpit’s equation and
it is written in equation number five so, charpit equation is given by dx by fp, dy
qfz which is coefficient of del g del q
now, solving this simultaneous equation is easy so, now our task is to find the solution
of the simultaneous equation which is written in five now, we shall take one example to
partial differential equation and the entire module, we shall take two independent variables
pq plus qy minus yz equals to zero this is a nonlinear first order partial differential
equation so, this equation can be written in the form capital f equals to pxy plus pq
the charpit equations, equation for the given function can be written as we have discussed
so, after integrating p is some constant equals to a say and from the given equation, see
if you substitute the value of p in the given equation, that means pxy plus pq plus qy minus
yz equals to zero, one can obtain the value of q as y into z minus ax by y plus a
and one dependent variable so, let me first explain the charpit’s method in our first slide
can get a solution z minus ax into y plus a to the power a equals to b into e to the
power y, where b is a constant and a is also a constant therefore this is our required
integral and this is the general integral since it involves two arbitrary constants
small a and small b
now, charpit equations can be simplified in some particular cases now, i am going to
discuss those particular cases suppose the equation is given in the form such that it
involves only p and q, that means the equation can be written in the form capital fpq equals
to zero, which is written in equation number six so, the corresponding charpit equation
first we shall discuss charpit’s method of solution suppose we have a given equation
so, from this equation, we can find dq equals to zero means q equals to constant a
now, if we substitute the value of a in the given equation, we can find value of p as some function
f of a, which is also a constant now, if we substitute the values of p and q in the
expression for dz, so we obtain dz equals to pdx plus qdy therefore it becomes f adx
now, we shall take another example which we have to solve using charpit method, the equation
is given p plus q equals to pq so, here the given equation can be written in the form
p plus q minus pq equals to zero and the corresponding auxiliary equation or the charpit
equation can be written in this form dx by one minus q equals to dy by one minus p equals
capital f x, y, z, p, q equals to zero, which is written in equation number one
to dz by this, dp by zero equals to dq by zero
so, after integrating we get one value of q as q equals to constant equals to a and
substituting this value of q in the given equation means p plus q equals to pq, we can
get the value of p as a by a minus one now, substituting the values of p and q in dz,
now, i shall discuss another simplified form of charpit equation where the given equation
does not involve the independent variables x and y so, the equation can be written in
the form fzpq equals to zero, which is written in equation number seven so, the corresponding
auxiliary equation is written in the next line dx by fp equals to dy by fq equals to
so, this is a nonlinear equation and this is first order equation where small p and small q are
so, from this equation, for this particular form, we can see that last two equation, from
the last two equation we can obtain a relation between p and q, like q is equal to a into p
where a is a constant now, if you substitute the value of q in the given equation, that
means in equation number seven, we can find the value of p as some function of az
that means we get p as some function of az and q is some function of az
now, in the total differential of z that means dz equals to pdx plus qdy, we get relation
solution of the given equation seven easily now, we shall illustrate this idea taking
one example suppose this is our given, so let us take this example example we have
respectively del z del x and del z del y so, in charpit’s methods, the basic idea
to solve the equation p square z square plus q square equals to one so, this is a nonlinear
first order partial differential equation and the equation does not involve any x and y
so, this is our case two, so in this case, the auxiliary equation can be written in this
form, dx by two pz square equals to dy by two q equals to dz by two p square z square
plus two q square equals to dp by minus two pqz equals to dq by minus two p square qz
so, from last two equation, one can obtain a relation between q and p as q is equal to
a into p where a is an arbitrary constant
now, if we substitute the value of q in the given equation, that means p square z square
plus q square minus one equals to zero, one can obtain the value of p as p equals to one
divided by square root za square plus a square thus, the equation dz equals to pdx plus qdy
in module five of chapter two, i shall discuss about integral surfaces satisfying some given
and this is obtained by substituting the value of z from equation of gamma to the equation
z plus a square x equals to axy plus bx square now, the condition for having two equal roots
we get a relation between b ac d as b is equals to d plus minus ac now, taking b is equal
to d plus ac, the subsystem becomes z plus a square x equals to axy plus d plus ac into
now, it has the envelope x square cx plus y whole square equals to four x into z minus
dx square, that means this is the solution and we know that the envelope is also the
solution of the given equation, therefore x into y plus cx whole square equals to four
into z minus dx square represent another integral of the given equation and since this solution
involve two arbitrary constants c and d, so this is the complete integral of the given
be a particular case of the general integral corresponding to two, that is the envelope
equation so, in this example we have explained or rather we can say we have derived one complete
integral from the other
now, i shall discuss how to find integral surface circumscribing a given surface two
surfaces are called to circumscribe each other if they touch in a curve that curve may not
be a planar curve for example, a conicoid and its circumscribing and its enveloping
cylinder are circumscribed by each other the procedure of finding this type of integral
surface is similar as we described in the previous section so, for derivation let us
go to the slide show of this topic
suppose we have the partial differential equation f equals to zero, and let it has complete
of a one-parameter subsystem of two or it may be the envelope of a two-parameter system
a given surface sigma, the equation of that surface is phi equals to zero, which is written
so, now we are interested to find the integral surface e which is touched or circumscribe
by the surface gamma through the curve, by the surface sigma through the curve gamma
now, e is the envelope of a one-parameter subsystem s of a two-parameter system two
and so it is touched at each point p of gamma by a member sp of the subsystem
envelope of the set of equations or set of surfaces two, which touch the surface seven
now, the surface two that means the complete integral of the given equation touches the
of two, that means it may be a singular integral but, in practice the case two occurs most
x equals to fy by phi y equals to fz by phi z are consistent
the equation nine represent that where the two surfaces two and eight meets the
y, z, from the four equations, that means two equations in equation number nine and
one equation in two and one equation in seven so, there are four equations, so from these
four equations, if we eliminate x, y, z, we can find a relation between a and b which
is written in equation ten as chi a, b equals to zero
from chi a, b equals to zero we can find the value of b as function of a chi one a or it
frequently, so we shall discuss only case two now
of two each of which touches seven and the intersection of this surface with sigma gives
the curve gamma and each of the relations eleven defines a subsystem whose envelope
e touches sigma along gamma
now, we shall take one example, which is given here in this slide we have to find integral
surface of the equation, the given equation is two y into one plus p square equals to pq
whose equation is circumscribed about the cone so, circumscribing surfaces is a cone
which is given by the equation x square plus z square equals to y square so, this is our
required, we have to prove the required integral is z square equals to y square into four y
square plus four x plus one
now, we shall go to the solution of this problem, so the given equation capital f is two y into
one plus p square minus pq equals to zero so, the corresponding auxiliary equations
are written in the next line and from this equation, simultaneous equation, it is easy
to find that dp by dp equals to zero so, p equals to constant, let say that constant
is small a and from the given equation, capital f equals to zero if you substitute the value
of p, we will get the value of q as two y into one plus a square divided by a
now, using the relation dz equals to pdx plus qdy, substituting the values of p and q, we
get a relation between dx, dy, dz which is written here and after integrating we get z
is some function of a and b where a, b are two arbitrary constants so, this represent
a complete integral of the given equation now, this equation can be written in this
the complete integral and which passes through a curve gamma then at its every point the
form small f equals to z minus ax minus y square into one plus a square by a minus b
equals to zero
and the equation of the circumscribing surface psi is given as psi equals to x square plus
y square minus z square equals to zero so, for circumscribing a surface we have the relation
fx by psi x equals to fy by psi y equals to fz by psi z so, using that relation we get
small x as some function of a which is written here and small z is another function of a
which is written here, a by two into one plus a square and also we have to satisfy f equals
to zero and psi equals to zero
so, f equals to zero gives y square as two into a minus two b by two into one plus a
envelope s is touched by a member of the subsystem in particular, at each point p of the curve
now, we remain to apply the condition psi equals to zero so, if we use this condition
where psi is x square plus y square minus z square is equal to zero, we obtain a functional
relation between a and b which is for this case b is equal to a by four now, in the
given equation means in the complete integral, f equals to zero, that means z minus x minus
y square into one plus a square by a minus b equals to zero
in this complete integral, if you substitute the value of b as a by four and if we calculate
the envelope of this one parameter family of curves, we get the envelope as z square
equals to y square into four y square plus four x plus one so, this is our required
integral which circumscribe the given equation of the surface for this case it is a cone
now, we have reached the last module of chapter two this chapter is devoted to the theory
of first order partial differential equation in the first module of this chapter we have
discussed about the basic ideas of a first order partial differential equation in module
two we have discussed about a quasi linear first order partial differential equation
we have derived lagrange auxiliary equation for a quasi linear equation and in third chapter
we have discussed about a nonlinear partial differential equation and in this chapter
we have derived and discussed the cauchy’s method of characteristic to find a nonlinear
charpit’s method and jacobi’s method to find solution of a nonlinear partial first
order differential equation
and in the last module we have just discussed how to find integral surface of a given equation
since sp touches s at p, it also touches s at the same point so, s is the envelope of
satisfying some given conditions so, in these five modules we have discussed different type
of first order partial differential equations and we have discussed different type of solutions
of these equations, thus this chapter will help us to understand any kind of first order
partial differential equation in this way we end the last module and the chapter two
a one-parameter subsystem two each of whose members touches the curve gamma, provided
conditions i shall mainly discuss three different things like integral surfaces passing through
that such a subsystem exist now, to determine s we have to consider subsystem made up of
the curve gamma touches the surface two, the equation two has two equal roots
so, solving equation three and four, we can get a functional relation between a and b as phi a, b equals to zero
and from that equation we can find b is some function of psi one a or b is some
function of psi two a so, this each of this subsystem will give the envelope of the original equation
now, we shall explain the previous method taking this example, we have to find complete
a given curve, and i shall discuss the integral surface circumscribing a given surface and
integral of the equation p square x plus qy equals to z and we have to find the integral
surface which passes through the curve, for this case it is a line y is equal to one,
x plus z equals to zero so, our given equation is capital f equals to z minus p square x
minus qy equals to zero, and we have already learned in module two the charpit’s equations
so, the corresponding charpit's equation becomes which is written in the next line dx by minus
two px equals to dy by minus q equals to dz by minus two p square x minus qy equals to
dp by p square plus p equals to dq by zero now, from the last equation we get q as constant
equals to a, say now, from the given equation f equals to zero, if we put the value of q,
we can obtain the value of p, which is written here z minus ay by x to the power half
now, using the relation dz equals to pdx plus qdy and substituting the values of p and q
i shall derive one complete integral from a given another complete integral
we get the equation dz minus ay by z minus ay to the power half equals to dx by x to
the power half so, after integration we get a relation z minus ay to the power half equals
to x to the power half plus b to the power half, where b is an arbitrary constant and
that equation can be written in the form x plus ay minus z plus b
whole square equals to two bx
now, this equation involves two arbitrary constants a and b, so this is the complete
integral of the given equation now, we have to find that integral which passes through
the given equation of the line, now the parametric form of the equation of the line can be written
in this form x equals to t, y equals to one, z equals to minus t if we substitute the
values of x, y, z from two to one, we get a relation which is written here, four t square
so, let us first discuss the first integral surface passing through a given curve
plus four at plus a plus b whole square equals to zero
since this is the envelope of the given system, it has two equal roots so, the condition
of two equal roots gives a square equals to a plus b whole square and after simplification
the complete integral which is written in one can be obtained by substituting the value
of b s minus two a
so, that one-parameter system is written here, y minus two whole square a square plus x minus
z whole square plus two into x y plus two minus z y minus two into a equals to zero
the envelope of this system we have to solve this equation together with del del a of this
so, go to the slide show of that equations suppose we want to find integral of the equation one,
function equals to zero
so, solving these two equations if we eliminate a from those two equation we get a function
which is written in the last line x into y plus two minus z into y minus two whole square
equals to y minus two whole square into x minus z whole square so, the function z defined
by this equation is the solution of the problem so, this is the general integral of the given
equation which passes through the given line
complete integral small f x, y, z, a, b equals to zero and we now show that there exist
another relation g x, y, z, c, d equals to zero and which is also the complete integral
of the given equation since in the solution which is written in six involves two arbitrary
capital f equals to zero, which passes through the curve, which is written in parametric
constants c and d, it also represent a complete integral
now, on the surface six we choose a curve gamma whose equations contain two arbitrary
constants c and d now, we shall find the envelope of the one-parameter subsystem of
two touching the curve gamma, where two is the equation small f x, y, z, a, b equals
to zero now, we illustrate this idea taking one simple example
suppose we have a partial differential equation two xz plus q square equals to x into xp plus
yp we have to show that it has the complete integral z plus a square x equals axy plus
bx square and from that we have to derive that x into y plus cx whole square equals
to four into z minus dx square is also a complete integral of given equation
now, i shall discuss the solution the given equation can be written in the form capital
form x equals to xt, y equals to yt, z equals to zt, where t is the parameter
f equals to two xz plus q square minus x into xp plus yq equals to zero now, the corresponding
charpit equations are dx by minus x square equals to dy by two q minus xy equals to dz
by minus px square plus two q square minus qxy equals to dp by minus two z plus yq equals
to dq by minus qx
now, from this auxiliary equation, if you take the first and last equation, we can find
the integral easily q as function of ax as ax, where a is a constant now, from the given
equation f equals to zero, if you substitute the value of q, we can find the value of p,
obtain a pfaffian differential equation which is written here
and this can be solved, we can find the integral of this equation, the integral of this equation
now, the integral, maybe particular case of a complete integral small f x, y, z, a, b
is written in the last line z plus a square x equals to axy plus b y square
so, this is the complete integral of the given equation which we need to proof, so that is proofed here
in equation one
so, from the equation of the surface if we put y is equal to zero, we get the value of
z as c square x cube plus four dx square by four so, equation of the curve gamma is written here
now, at the intersection of the complete integral which we have obtained as function
a square equals to zero
now, i am going to start module one of chapter three chapter three is devoted to the theory
telegraphy equation and this is an equation with unknown function e
similarly, from the equation, from the above equation nine and ten, if we differentiate
the first equation nine with respect to t and equation ten with respect to x, we obtain
the equations which is written here, del two e del t del x plus r del i del t plus l
del two i del t square equals to zero and del two i del x square plus g del e del x plus
c del two e del x del t equals to zero
and from these equations if we eliminate the variable e, one can obtain an equation in
variable i to the equation, which is similar to the equation thirteen only e is replaced
by the variable i that means one can say that the equation thirteen is satisfied by
and we shall show that with some transformation in independent variables, we can transform
equivalent to zero and if we put g is equal to zero and l equals to zero in equation number
thirteen, one can see that thirteen reduces to the equation del e del t equals to k del
two e del x square, where k equals to rc to the power minus one
this equation is also called telegraphy equation but it is mostly known as the heat conduction
we are interested to high frequency phenomena so, for that case time derivative is most important,
so one can assume r equals to zero and g equals to zero in equation number nine
so in, so if we assume r equals to zero and g equals to zero in equation nine and ten,
the equation to a second order equation with constant coefficients and lastly in third
we can get equation which is written here del two e del t square equals to c square
del two e del x square, where c equals to lc to the power minus half and this equation
partial differential equation
now, i am taking one example from electronics where one can get second order pde so, in
electronics we are considering this example, so according to gauss’ law of flux of electric
vector e out of a surface s which bounding an arbitrary volume v is four pi times the
charge contained in the volume v so, that can be written in the integral form like integration
of e ds over s equals to four pi integration of rho dv
in the left hand side, the integration is the surface integration and in the right hand
module we shall discuss about the canonical form of a second order differential equation
side, it is volume integration and rho is the density of electric charge and all of
we know that gauss' divergence theorem says that surface integration of e over the surface
s is equals to divergence of the function e over the volume v which is written here
so, from if we use the gauss' theorem then we obtain the surface integration of divergence
then we get divergence of e is equals to four pi rho
now, if we assume that e is derivable from a potential phi such that e is equals to minus
equation which is written in equation number fifteen grad square phi equals to minus four
pi rho and this is a famous equation which is known as poisson’s equation
and we shall derive how to obtain the canonical form from a given equation and in this way
and this is again we are getting a second order partial differential equation and this is a linear equation
and if there is no any charge then rho can be assumed as zero, then fifteen is reduces
to an equation grad square phi equals to zero and which is known as laplace equation or
a second order partial differential equation and which are also linear
now, i am taking few example to illustrate that how a second order differential equation
can be obtained when the dependent variable is sum of two unknown function so, let us
take this example, let z is sum of two unknown function f and g, where f and g are function
of x square minus y, x square plus y respectively and we don’t know the functional form of f and g
so, they are arbitrary function
we shall finish chapter three
take derivative of the functional relation with respect to x, so we get del z del x equals
to two x f dash plus two x g dash and if you take derivative with respect to y, we
get del z del y equals to minus f dash plus g dash and taking derivative with respect
to x once again the first equation we get, del two z del x square equals to, the expression
is written here
so, from this equation we want to obtain a functional relation between the derivatives,
so for that we need to eliminate the unknown functions but, in these equations the unknown
functions are present in the form of derivatives, so we need to eliminate f dash, g dash, f
double dash and g double dash so, the expression for del two z del y square can be obtained
so, let us go to the first slide of module one of chapter three now, i am going to discuss
in the similar way
so, if we eliminate these functions f and g and their first order derivative and second
order derivative and if we compute this del two z del x square minus one by x del z del
equation, so we started with functional form where z is sum of two unknown function so,
eliminating these two unknown function we are getting a partial differential equation
of second order
phi dash so, from this equation we want to obtain a partial differential equation, so
for that so take z equals to one by x phi plus phi dash if you take first order derivative
origin of a second order equation that means how a second order partial differential equation
with respect to x of this equation, we obtain del z del x equals to minus one by x square
respect to y, so del z del y is equal one by x phi dash plus phi double dash
and we take the second order derivative of z with respect to x to obtain the expression
which is written here and we also need to take the second order derivative with respect
to y, del two z del y square equals to one by x phi double dash plus phi double dash
so, from these four equations, del z del x, del z del y, del two z del x square, del two
del two z del x square minus del two z del y square equals to two z by x square
so, taking this example we also see that, if z is sum of a function and its derivative,
can be generated from a solution so, first take one example, let z is a function of x,
the partial differential equation corresponding this functional form is a second order partial
differential equation thus, in this module we have discussed the origin of a second order
partial differential equation, we have seen that if a function or the dependent variable
and we shall also take two examples, one from electric flows and one from electronics to
derive a second order differential equation for a physical problem there are many examples
where these type of second order differential equation arise in practice so, in this way
we end module one of chapter three
v and u, v, w are functions of independent variables x and y
of second order partial differential equation the discussion with second order partial differential
in the entire discussion we are bounded to take the two independent variables so, here
in in this discussion we have only two independent variables, which are denoted by x and y
let small p be del z del x and q is del z del y, small r is del two z del x square, s is
del two z del x del y and t is del two z del y square these are the standard notation
which are used in in the theory of pde
so, let us first take derivative of equation one with respect to x, here z is our dependent
variable so, if we take differentiate with respect to x then del z del x equals to f
of equation one with respect to y, so del z del y which is q is equals to f dash u uy plus
g dash v vy plus wy now, thus we obtain equations in three, taking derivative of equation
equation is important because second order partial differential equation arise in many
one once with respect to x and y
now, we take derivative of equations which are written in three with respect to x and
y again, so we take the first equation r which is del two z del x square which is obtained
by differentiating p with respect to x and the equation is written in equation number
four so, if we take the derivative with respect to y of the equation p equals to f dash u
ux plus g dash v vx plus wx, we obtain the equation s equals to f double dash u ux uy
plus g double dash v vx vy plus f dash u uxy plus g dash v vxy plus wxy
now, if you take derivative with respect to y, the equation which is written as q is equal
to dot dot, we get the equation t equals to f double dash u uy square plus the terms
which are shown in equation number four thus we obtain five equations taking derivative of
problems in mathematical physics these types of equations arise to describe wave motion,
equation one now, in these five equations the unknowns are the function f and g, so
we eliminate the derivative f dash g dash, f double dash and g double dash from these
five equation and we obtain the relation, the determinant which is written in equation number five
now, if we expand this determinant with respect to the first column, then we obtain a relation
in the form which is written in equation number six, capital r small r plus capital s small
s plus capital t small t plus capital p small p plus capital q small q equals to w
and these capital r, capital s, capital t, capital p, capital q and capital w are functions of
independent variables x and y
so, if we observe equation number six, we can see that from equation number one we obtain
equation number six which is a second order linear partial differential equation
diffusion equation and electric flow, fluid flow, etcetera
so, we can say that if we observe equation one there are two unknown functions f and g
order which is written in equation number six
so, let me take one example, let z is some function of f and g, where f and g are some
unknown function and f and g are function of x plus ay and x minus ay respectively
now, we want to form a partial differential equation from the equation seven, so for that
purpose we take derivative of equation seven twice with respect to x so, we obtain the
relation r equals to f double dash plus g double dash
and if we take derivative with respect to y of equation seven, we obtain the relation
t is equal to a square f double dash plus a square g double dash and from these two
the entire chapter is divided into three modules, in first module i shall discuss about origin
equation if we eliminate f double dash and g double dash, we obtain a relation of the
form small t equals a square small r, which is a second order linear partial differential equation
so, using this example we also see that if the original equation which is written in
equation number seven contain, if z is written as sum of two unknown function then from that
function one can obtain a second order partial differential equation now, this concept can
be generalized for n number of functions
are some functions of x and y so, from this equation, from this relation one can lead
to an nth order linear partial differential equation in the last section we have discussed
the origin of a second order pde that means how a second order pde can be generated starting
of second order differential equation and we shall show that how a second order equation
from a solution and how they are linked with each other
now, i am going to discuss the application of, not application, how a second order differential
equation can come in some physical problem i shall take two examples, one from electric
flows and another from electronics and how a second order equation can come to solve
this type of problem that i am going to discuss, so go to the slide show
first i shall take one example from electric flow for that we consider a one-dimensional
flow of electricity in a long insulated cable and i is the current, e is the corresponding
voltage since there is a one-dimensional flow so in spatial direction there is only
one coordinate which is denoted by x and we have another variable which is time t
thus for the fall of potential in a linear element of length delta x situated at the
can arise starting from a solution in module two we shall discuss about the solution of
point x can be written, the equation can be written in this form minus delta e equals to
length and g is the conductance per unit length, then we have the another equation
now, from the above two equation, we can obtain these two partial differential equations,
from the first equation dividing it by delta x and the second equation can be obtained
from the equation which is written here minus delta i equals to ge delta x plus c into del e del t
del x and dividing this equation by delta x so, we obtained two equations with
a second order pde with constant coefficients and we shall also discuss in module two, a
two unknowns e and i
now, we want to obtain the equation with one unknown variables, so for that we differentiate
equation nine with respect to x to obtain the equation which is written in equation
number eleven and we obtain equation number twelve from equation ten taking derivative
with respect to t of the equation ten now, from the equation eleven and twelve if we
eliminate del i, the variable i that means from the equation eleven and twelve one can
eliminate del two i del x del t and del i del x can be eliminated from the equation ten
so, from equation ten, eleven, twelve, eliminating the variable i we can obtain a relation which
is written in equation number thirteen del two e del x square equals to lc del two e
special type of <?>equa</?> with variable coefficient which is known as cauchy-euler form
﻿now, i am going to start module two of chapter three in this module, we shall find or we shall
of beta r x minus alpha r y and this phi r are the unknown functions since there are n
reducible factors, so there are n unknown function or arbitrary function and so the solution in the
solution, the unknown functions are coming as sum of this function which is written here
now, we are taking one example to illustrate the previous idea
so in this equation in this example the equation is given d cube minus four d square d
dash plus four d d square z equals to zero so, capital f can be factorized in this way
d into d minus two d dash whole square z equals to zero so, you can see that d minus two d dash
is a double <?>dot</?> so, we need to use the concept which we
have learned just now to find the solution so, one solution the first one z equals to phi
zero minus y this corresponds to the factor d and there are two solutions or two unknown function
which corresponds to d minus two d dash which is sum, which is written here as sum over s x to the
so, this is the general solution of the given equation where the roots are repeated
till now, we have discussed how to find complementary function when the operator or the
irreducible form so, for that case it may not be possible to get a solution containing
full number of arbitrary functions, but it is possible to find solutions containing
as many arbitrary constants as we desire to illustrate this idea we shall take one example
so, before going to the example we need to explain one theorem which is stated there f
in equation number one, where capital d is the partial derivative with respect to x and d dash
operated over e to the power a x plus b y is equal to f of a b e to the power a x plus b y
the proof of this theorem is very simple because we know that if we operate a differential operator
to an exponential function then the coefficient of x will come instead of d and the coefficient of y
that means b will come instead of d dash
now, using this theorem one can see that f if the equation is given in the form capital
f z equals to zero we can assume a solution in the form e to the power a x plus b y
so, if we apply this function instead of z we will get according to this theorem capital f a b e to
one can obtain a set of values for a and b which satisfies this equation
let those set of values are ar, br now, these are the solution of the given equation,
so their linear combination that means sum of cr exponential of arx plus bry is the solution
ar, br satisfies the equation f ar, br equals to zero
so, in this example if you see the first factor this is reducible
because the first factor is a linear factor but the second factor is not reducible
that means that factor cannot be retained as the product of two linear factors so, for that case,
we can assume the solution in the form e to the power arx plus bry, where
ar, br satisfies the relation ar square plus br plus three equals to zero
and for the reducible factor the solution is e to the power minus five x phi of two x plus y
c r s d to the power r d dash to the power s where c r s are some constants
therefore, the required solution of the given equation is z equals to the linear combinations
of these functions here we have to note that, there are infinite number of points
which satisfies the relation ar square plus br plus three equals to zero
so, the summation, in the summation there are infinite number of terms, there may be
infinite number of terms in this summation but this series should be uniformly convergent
in the last section we have discussed about the method of finding complementary function of a
linear pde with constant coefficients now, we are going to discuss how to find particular integral
of a nonhomogeneous pde with constant coefficient and we shall discuss some particular cases,
we shall take the function, exponential function, polynomial function, sine or cosine functions
and the combination of these functions taking this type of function, we shall derive
now, we shall first discuss the general solution of the equation capital f
some rules for finding particular integrals we shall also discuss when the equations
are given in the form of cauchy-euler form that means when the coefficients of the
differential equations are not constants but those coefficients are variables but those
variables are in some particular form to discuss all this we need to go to the slide show
suppose we have an equation capital f z equals to small f x,
y, say particular integral can be considered as an operator one by f operating on small f
and we shall discuss to find particular integral for some particular cases that means
when small f is some particular functions first we shall start taking small f
to the power s, where r and s are positive integers or zero and ars are constants
d, d dash z equals to zero and the general solution of the equation which is written
so, if small f is given in this form particular integral can be written
the idea will be more clear if we take one example
so, we take this example, so in this example small f function is x square plus xy plus y square
and capital f is capital d plus d dash square so, it’s very easy to find the complementary function,
so complementary function is written here, since there is a repeated root we will get
the complementary function in this form phi one x minus y plus x into phi two x minus y
now, particular integral is one by capital f d dash operator, so in this case it is one
in equation number three is called the complementary function of the equation one
by d plus d dash square operating on x square plus x y plus y square
now, here, we take the factor d square and then the denominator becomes one plus d dash
by d to the power two, so we need to operate one plus d dash by d to the power minus one
and we have to expand this series in binomial so, the binomial expansion of that operator becomes
one minus two d dash by d plus three d dash square by d square minus dot dot
this binomial series contains infinite number of terms, but since in small f, that means
in the function x square plus xy plus y square, the highest order of the polynomial is two,
then it is sufficient to take the terms up to d dash square by d square
so, that’s why we took only the first three terms in the expansion
so, in the second line we write, we first operate one on the function x square plus xy plus y square, so
and any particular solution of equation one is known as its particular integral
it becomes x square plus xy plus y square and if we operate the second term minus two d dash by d,
this d dash is the differential operator with respect to y
so, if we differentiate x square plus xy plus y square with respect to y, it becomes x plus two y
and now if we operate the third operator three d dash square by d square, that means d dash is
the derivative with respect to y, so d dash square represent derivative with respect to y twice so,
if we take second order derivative of x square plus xy plus y square twice with respect to y, it
becomes y so, the terms becomes one by the second line, its written in the second line, one by d
square x square plus xy plus y square minus two by d x plus two y plus three by d square into two
now, you have to remember that d represent a differential operator with respect to x,
therefore one by d represent the integration with respect to x so, one by d square is nothing but
and there is an well known theorem which states that if u be the complementary function and
twice integration of the function x square plus xy plus y square with respect to x, so this gives the
term x to the power four by twelve plus x cube y by six plus x square y square by two now, come to
the second term two by d operating on x plus two y that means you have to operate two by d cube
on the term x plus two y, so it gives minus two into x to the power four by twenty-four
plus x cube y by three and the last terms give the fourth
so it gives x to the power four by twenty-four so, after simplification it becomes one by four
x to the power four minus two x cube y plus two x square y square
so, the required solution or the general solution of the given equation
is the complementary function plus particular integral, so its z equals to phi one plus x phi
z one be a particular integral of the equation one then
discuss about the methods for solving a second order partial differential equation with constant coefficients
two plus one by four x to the power four minus two x cube y plus two x square y square
now, i am going to discuss the case when small f y is in exponential form so,
the particular integral can be written as one by f d operating on e to the power ax plus b y
so, one by f d can be considered as the inverse operator of the operator capital f so, we know
the property of exponential function, so using that property we can write the particular integral
as one by f a, b into e to the power ax plus b y, provided capital f a, b is not equals to zero
and the case when f a, b equals to zero, we shall discuss that case separately
now, take this example, so in this example,
we can see that it’s in the complementary function its reducible to linear factor
so, it’s easy to find the complementary function which is linear combination of phi one, phi two,
phi three, where phi one is function of y minus x, phi two is function of y plus three x
and phi three is function of y minus two x so, particular integral is one by f d operating
on e to the power two x plus y, so if we use the rule which is written in b,
we need to replace d by the coefficient of x that means two and d dash by coefficient of y
in this case it is one so, it becomes one by two plus one two minus three into two plus two
into e to the power two x plus y, so minus one by twelve e to the power two x plus y
the general solution becomes z equals to phi one plus phi two plus phi three minus one by twelve e
to the power two x plus y that is complementary function plus particular integral
now, i am going to discuss the case when small f is either a cosine function or sine function
first of all, we shall discuss when capital f is in the form
of which is written here phi of d square d d dash, d dash square that means the function
f is some function of d square d d dash or d dash square, so for that case if we operate
phi on the function cos ax plus b y, d square will be replaced by minus a square and d d dash
will be replaced by minus ab and d dash square will be replaced by minus b dash square
so, using this property one can find particular integral in this form,
so particular integral is one by f operating on cos ax plus b y, so this equals to one by phi
operating on cos ax plus b y, so that equals to one by phi minus a square minus ab minus b square
cos ax plus b y, provided phi minus a square minus b square minus b square is not equals to zero
the same rule is applicable when there is sin function instead of cos function
so, here is one example, the right hand side is sin x into cos two x,
so to apply the previous rule we need to write this function as in this form,
sin of x plus two y minus sin of x minus two y so, complementary function is very easy to find,
so complementary function becomes phi one y plus phi two x plus y and the particular integral
so, according to previous rule we need to replace d square by minus one square and d d dash by minus
one into two, so that rule is applied here and for the second function we are using the same rule
and getting the particular integral as half of sin x plus two y plus one by six sin x minus two y
thus the required solution becomes z equals to cf plus pi
now, i am going to discuss the case where capital f a, b is equals to zero so, if capital f a,
b becomes zero then the earlier methods will not be applicable, so for that case
in the function capital f d d dash, there will be a factor bd minus ad dash so,
we can take out that factor from f and the f can be written as bd minus ad dash into some g
which is function of d and d dash and we also assume that g a, b is not equals to
zero now, consider the differential equation bd minus ad dash z equals to capital f ax plus b y
now, the corresponding subsidiary equation, this is a first order partial differential equation, so
we can write the corresponding lagrange equation which is written here dx by b equals to dy
by minus a equals to dz by f of ax plus b y taking first two equation,
one can obtain a solution as ax plus b y equals to constant, let that constant is c now,
taking the first and third equation and using the relation ax plus b y equals to c, we get the
equation dx by b equals to dz by f c and solving this equation we get z equals to x by b into f c
is also a solution of this equation and this is called the super position principle
now, we replace c by the function ax plus b y we get, z equals to x by b into f ax plus b y
so, the particular integral for this equation can be written as z equals to one by bd minus
ad dash operating on f is equal to x by b f ax plus b y
now, we shall use this concept to solve the equation where f a, b equals to zero
now, think about the equation where f a, b equals to zero, for that case particular integral is
one by f operating on small f now, capital f can be written as bd minus ad dash into
capital g d d dash, since capital g a, b is not equals to zero after operating one by capital g
d d dash on f ax plus b y, one can replace in the function g d by a and d dash by b, so we
obtain the expression one by g a, b into one by bd minus ad dash operating on small f
and now we need to apply the previous concept, where we obtain the solution of bd minus ad dash
so, for a linear equation one can apply super position principle
z equals to f, using that concept we can write this expression as x by b into f ax plus b y
so, the particular integral for this case becomes x by bg a, b into f ax plus b y
now, think about the expression for capital f which is bd minus ad dash into g, now if we
differentiate the function f with respect to d, we get f dash d d dash equals to bg
plus bd minus ad dash into g dash so, f dash a, b is equal to b into g a, b
so, particular integral becomes x by f dash a, b into f ax plus b y so, here b into g
is replaced by f dash, provided f dash a, b is not equals to zero
now, we shall illustrate that idea using this example
so, this is a second order linear partial differential equation with constant coefficient
but, the right hand side is some function of x plus two y, so in this case we can see that,
so now we shall categorize a linear differential operator f d, d dash into two classes,
complementary function, since there is a repeated root in capital f, so complementary
function can be written in this way phi one x plus two y plus x phi two x plus two y
now, the particular integral it becomes one by f d square
four d square minus four d d dash plus d dash square operating on sixteen log x plus two y
and just before we have learned that this becomes zero, so a particular integral can be written as
x by f dash a, b into small ax plus b y so, we use that concept, so it becomes one
divided by f dash, so it is f d minus four d dash operating on log x plus two y
again the denominator vanishes for d equals to one and d dash equals to two so, its again becomes x
divided by f dash, so in this case f function is f d minus four d dash, so its derivative
with respect to d is only eight so, particular integral is sixteen x square divided by eight
one is the reducible and the another one is the irreducible form the function
into log x plus two y so, after simplification it becomes two x square into log x plus two y
now, f may be combination of exponential function and the another function so it can be written as
e to the power ax plus b y into v so, for that case, particular integral can be written as one
by capital f operating on e to the power ax plus b y into v and e to the power ax plus b y can be
taken out from the operator one by v, one by f and in the function f d will be replaced by d plus a
and d dash will be replaced by d dash b and that will be operated on the function capital v
now, i want to discuss about a particular form of a second order differential
equation where the coefficients are not constant but the variable coefficients
but, these variable coefficients has some particular form that means capital f,
the function capital f can be written as function of x into capital d and y into d dash so,
f is said to be reducible if it can be written as the product of linear factors of the form
if the capital f is in this particular form that equation is known as cauchy-euler equation
this equation can be transformed into an equation with constant coefficient
with some transformation in the independent variables x and y and the transformation is this
x equals to e to the power u and y is equal to e to the power v so, if we write down the equation,
the given equation in terms of the variables u and v instead of x and y,
the equation will become a differential equation with constant coefficients
and we know how to find the solution of a equation with constant coefficients,
so using those concepts one can solve this particular type of equation or the cauchy-euler
equation using this transformation thus, in module two of chapter three we have learned how to find
alpha d plus beta d dash plus gamma where alpha beta and gamma are constants and capital f,
in the entire discussion we shall be confined on taking two independent variables
complementary function of a partial differential equation with constant coefficient
and we have learned how to find particular integral of that equation taking some
particular functions such as exponential function, polynomial function, sine and cosine function and
the combination of these functions we have also discussed how to find solution of a equation
the case b where capital f is called irreducible if it cannot be factored into linear factors
as it is done in class a now, i am taking here one example,
where you can see one reducible factor and another irreducible factors
so, in this example, capital f is d cube minus d square d dash minus two d d dash square
plus d dash so, in this factors you can see that all the factors are linear factors
square d dash into d dash plus one plus d d dash minus d dash square
minus d dash cube if we factorize this f we will get two factors which is written here d
square plus d dash and d minus d dash minus d dash square if we observe these two factors, these two
and this process or method can be extended when there are nth order partial differential
factors are not further reducible to linear factors, so this f is called irreducible
now, i shall discuss the case where the function f can be factored into reducible
and we also assume that alpha r is not equals to zero, then u r equals to
exponential of minus gamma r by alpha r x into phi r beta r x
minus alpha r y is the solution of the equation f z equals to zero
but if, alpha r equals to zero then the theorem is the next theorem which is stated here,
for that case we are assuming that beta r is not equals to zero so, beta r d dash plus gamma r
if this is a factor of f and phi r xi is an arbitrary function of the single variable xi
equation with constant coefficient the entire module is divided into two section
x so, using these two theorems we can find the solution of a homogeneous equation
so we, to illustrate the idea we are taking one example
so, capital f the expression for capital f is written here d cube plus three d dash minus four
into d square plus three d dash square minus eight d plus three d plus three minus four d
dash plus d dash square into d dash z equals to zero so, if we observe the function capital f
then we see that capital f can be factorized which is given in the solution in this form
d plus d dash minus one into d plus d dash minus three into d plus d dash z equals to zero
so, for this example f is reducible to linear factors,
so using the first theorem the one solution is e to the power x into phi one y minus x
in the first section, i shall discuss how to find general solution of a homogeneous equation then
and e to the power three x into phi two y minus x and the third solution phi three y minus x
now, the linear combinations of these three solutions will be the general solution of
the given equation which is written here z equals to the sum of these three functions
now, suppose that there is a linear factor of f but that factor is repeated so, let us take
one example where the linear factor comes twice and it is written in equation number four
so, to solve this equation we assume another function, another variable z as alpha r d
plus beta r d dash plus gamma r into z so if we assume the expression for capital z
like this the equation four reduces to the form alpha r d plus beta r d dash plus gamma r
operating on capital z equals to zero now, z is our unknown function, so using the previous
theorem we can find the expression for z as z equals to exponential of minus gamma r by
in the next section, i shall discuss how to find particular integral of a nonhomogeneous
now, if we see what is our capital z, this capital z we have assumed as alpha r
equation alpha r del z del x plus beta r del z del y plus gamma r z equals to some function of x and
y which is written in the right side now, this is a first order partial differential equation
and we know how to find solution of a first order differential equation
we have learned that in chapter two so, using that concept one can find the
corresponding auxiliary equation or lagrange auxiliary equation is like that dx by alpha r
equals to dy by beta r equals to dz by which is written here
now, this simultaneous equation can be solved easily so, if we take first two equation,
pde with constant coefficient so, let us start the first slide of this module
we can get a solution beta r x minus alpha r y equals to constant let’s say that constant is
c one and we can say there is one expression beta r in the equation in the denominator
of the last expression dz by some function so where beta r x minus alpha r y is present
so in that place one can replace that function with the constant c one
so, putting that value we obtain the relation which is written here so taking the first equation
and last equation of the simultaneous equation that means dx by alpha r equals to dz by minus
gamma r z plus exponential of minus gamma r by alpha r x into phi r c one
since, c one is a constant this is a ordinary first order linear differential equation so,
one can solve this linear differential equation easily and the solution is written here z equals
to one by alpha r phi r c one x plus c two into exponential of minus gamma r by alpha r into x
as i have told, in this module i shall discuss about the solution of a linear partial
now, to find the solution of the original equation we need to
replace c one by the function beta r x minus alpha r y, so replacing c one and also the c two
the expression for c two we can obtain the function z equals to x
phi r beta r x minus alpha r y plus <?>psi r</?> beta r x minus alpha r y into exponential
of minus gamma r by alpha r into x, where phi r and psi r are the arbitrary function
so, this idea can be generalized when there are n repeated roots in the function capital f
so, that theorem is stated now if alpha r d plus beta r d dash plus gamma r to the power
then a solution of the equation f z equals to zero is z equals to exponential of minus
gamma r by alpha r x into sum of x to the power s minus one phi r s
differential equation with constant coefficient the general form of linear pde with constant
now, i am going to start module three of chapter three in module two, we have discussed with
and the calculation is shown in the slide
therefore, our equation becomes b equals to this which is written here, x square plus
eta eta x minus x into zeta xi xi y plus zeta eta eta y, minus two into x square minus y
these values in the transformed coordinate system, the equation becomes zeta xi eta equals
to eta square minus one divided by eta square plus one whole square
so, the complete integral, so this is the canonical form and this is of second order
partial differential equation with constant coefficient, so, we can solve it easily so, its
method or green’s function method to find solution of a linear hyperbolic partial differential equation
general solution is complementary function plus particular integral so, the general
square plus one so, if we come back to our coordinate system x, y, z, the solution becomes
discuss about the parabolic case where s square minus four rt equals to zero
so, let us start from the quadratic equation r lambda square plus s lambda equals to zero
since this is the parabolic equation, this quadratic equation has two equal roots, let
equals to constant is a solution of the equation dy dx plus lambda x, y equals to zero
now, a zeta x, xi x, xi y equals to zero, and a square minus four rt equals to zero
so, let us go to the first slide of this module the general form of a linear second order
so, from equation six, we have b equals to zero, but a eta x, eta y cannot be zero
otherwise, j will become zero, so we cannot choose eta and xi as two independent coordinates
thus, the equation four reduces to the form, zeta eta eta equals to some function psi of
xi, eta, zeta, zeta xi, zeta eta, which is written in equation number twelve so, this
is the canonical form of a parabolic partial differential equation, and it can be solved
easily because its coefficients are constant now, we shall take one example to illustrate
so, in this case capital r is x square, capital s is minus two x y, capital t is y square,
so, s square minus four rt equals to zero now, consider r lambda square plus s lambda
plus t equals to zero, so, substituting the values r, s, t we get the quadratic equation
partial differential equation can be written in this form, which is given in equation number
which is written here so, the roots of this equation is lambda equals to y by x, y by
x, so this is repeated row so, the the solution can be obtained from the equation dy dx plus
y by x equals to zero and if we solve this equation, we get one integral as xy equals to constant
provided the jacobian of xi and eta is not equals to zero, so, we take in this case eta
as y by x so, our transformation is xi is equal to x y and eta is equal to y by x
so, using this transformation we can calculate the value of a as zero, and value of a xi
x, xi y is zero but, value of a eta x, eta y is not equals to zero, its value is four
into y square by x square the detailed calculation can be seen in the slide and the value of
b is written here
one capital r small r plus capital s small s plus capital t small t plus small f which
value of capital f which is minus eight into zeta eta minus one into y by x substituting
x y plus x by y f two x y plus x by y, so it can be written in some different form
like this, f one x y plus x square by x y into f two x y plus y by x
so, it can be written as z equals to phi one x, y plus x square phi two x y plus y by x,
the elliptic case where s square minus four rt is less than zero so, for this case the
quadratic equation r lambda square plus s lambda plus t equals to zero has complex roots
let those two roots are xi equals to alpha plus i beta and eta equals to alpha minus
i beta to get the normal form for this case we need another transformation from xi eta
to alpha, beta
so, let’s take alpha equals to half of xi plus eta, and beta is equal to half of eta
plus xi this transformation is required because xi and eta they are not real quantity, but
we want to get the equation in real variables but, if we do this transformation, alpha and
beta becomes real now, we want to write the equation in terms of the real variables, alpha
partial derivative of capital z with respect to x twice that means small r is del two
zeta del xi del eta is one by four del two zeta del alpha square plus del two zeta del
beta square
and the value of a xi x, xi y it becomes zero, and value of a eta x, eta y this is also zero
but, the value of b square it becomes negative, so the equation four deduces to the form,
del two zeta del alpha square plus del two zeta del beta square equals to chi which is
function of alpha, beta, zeta, zeta alpha, zeta beta so, equation thirteen is the canonical
form or the normal form of an elliptical partial differential equation now, we are discussing
one example which is elliptical, so in this example, the values of r is one, s is two,
capital t is four and small f is two p plus three q
and if we compute s square minus four rt, its value is less than zero and the quadratic
equation r lambda square plus s lambda plus four equals to zero, it has two complex roots,
minus one plus minus i into root three so, the characteristic equations are dy dx plus
minus one plus i into root three, that means this is lambda one equals to zero and dy dx
plus lambda two equals to zero so, it has solution, y plus lambda one x equals to constant,
and y plus lambda two x equals to constant so, we we can choose xi as y minus x plus
i into root three x and our eta as y minus x minus i into root three x
now, to get the equation in terms of some real variables we do this substitution,
alpha equals to half of xi plus eta and beta equals to i by two eta minus xi so, this gives alpha
as y minus x, and beta as root three x so, in terms of alpha and beta the expression
for a becomes zero, and the value of a eta x, eta y, this is zero, zeta x, zeta y this
and small p is del z del x and small q is del z del y
is also zero and the value of capital b after simplification becomes zero, and the value
of capital f which is minus zeta minus two root three zeta beta
so, the equation becomes zeta xi eta equals to one by four del two zeta del alpha square
of the given equation becomes zeta alpha alpha plus zeta beta beta equals to minus one by
three zeta alpha plus two root three zeta beta now, i am going to discuss very powerful
method known as riemann’s method or the method of green’s function to find solution
of a linear hyperbolic partial differential equation
this method is very useful to find solution of a one-dimensional wave equation, so, to
explain that method we need to go to the slide show suppose, we have a linear hyperbolic
partial differential equation which are in normal form and the equation is written in
equation number one, del two z del x del y plus a del z del x plus b del z del y plus cz
equals to f so, in compact form, we can write that l z is equal to f, where l is the
operator, del two del x del y plus a del del x plus b del del y plus c
let w be an arbitrary function of x and y such that its first order derivatives are continuous
so, for that function w we can compute this, w del two z del x del y minus
z del two w del x del y as del del y of w del z del x minus del del x of z del w del
y and w a del z del x plus z del del x of a w is equal to del del x of awz, and similarly,
capital l is equivalent to capital r del two del x square plus capital s del two del x
a partial differential equation, linear with constant coefficients, and we have also discussed
a w minus del del y of b w plus c w
and the function u is of the form, awz minus z del w del y, and v is equal to bwz plus
w del z del y the relation which is written in equation number two is called lagrange
identity, and the operator l star which is defined in equation number three is called
be an arbitrary point in this plane, and sigma be the area enclosed by the contour abpa
you see the diagram, then it will be clear
sigma del u del x plus del v del y because these two quantities are same these equals
to integration of udy minus vdx using green's theorem so, using green's theorem this surface
so, it can be seen in the figure abpa, so this is our closed contour small c so,
now this contour can be decomposed into three parts
the contour c into three parts a to b, udy minus vdx plus b to p if you see the line
b to p, here there is no any change of x, so dx equals to zero along bp so, here the
dx part is zero, only udy is present and along the curve p to a there is no any change of
y, so, dy is zero so, here p to a vdx part is there
y and we also assume that these functions possesses continuous partial derivatives of
v, we get bwz plus w del z del x dx so, it can, with some manipulation we can write in
equals to, which is written in the last line of this slide, p to a z into bw minus del
a vdx
minus the expression which is written here, and this can be obtained using relation five
so, using relation five we are substituting the value of p to a vdx so, after that substitution
discussion, you can notice that the function w is arbitrary we didn’t assume any form
of w, so now we want to choose w in such a way that it satisfies these four conditions
so, w is such that l star w equals to zero throughout the xy-plane and del w del x equals
to bw when y equals to eta
and del w del y equals to aw when x equals to xi and w equals to one when x equals to
xi, y equals to eta the function w which satisfies these four conditions is called
the green's function the function which satisfies this condition is called green's function
or riemann-green’s function of l z equals to f x, y so, value of z at the point p can
be written with the expression which is written in equation number seven so, the vale of
z at any point can be obtained if z and del z del x are prescribed on sigma again, we
know the relation zw at b minus zw at a equals to integration a to b del del x of zw dx plus
del del y of zw dy
so, if we use this relation, we can obtain another value of z at p, which is written
in equation number eight therefore, z at p can be also obtained if the values of z
written in equation number nine so, we can see that if the values of z del z del x and
hyperbolic equation so, take this example and it is given that the green's function for this
square minus four rt is greater than zero and it is called parabolic if s square minus
equation w is x plus y into two xy plus xi minus eta into x minus y plus two
xi eta, divided by xi plus eta whole cube so, we have to find the solution of this the
given differential equation which satisfies the condition z equals to zero, del z del
x equals to three x square on y is equal to x
adjoining operator to l, l star can be written this which is shown here
now, this l star, now the green's function for this example, for this equation will satisfy
this four conditions, l star w equals to zero throughout the xy-plane del w del x equals
to two by x plus y into w on y is equal to eta, and del w del y equals to two by x plus
y into w on x equals to xi, and w equals to one at xi, eta so, these four conditions
four rt equals to zero
are satisfied by our supplied green's function w
and from this function, one can calculate del w del x, del w del y, del two w del x
del y, and we can also calculate w l minus z l star equals to del u del x plus del v
del y so, u becomes two zw by x plus y minus z into del w del y, and v is two zw by x plus
twelve by xi plus eta cube, integration xi to eta is to the power five plus x cube xi eta dx
so, z at xi eta becomes after simplification xi minus eta into two xi square minus xi eta
plus two eta square, so, xi z x, y equals to x minus y into two x square minus xy plus
two y square so, in this way we can find solution of a linear hyperbolic differential
and it is called elliptic if s square minus four rt is less than zero at any point x zero,
equation using green's function thus, in module three of chapter three, we have discussed
about canonical form of a second order partial differential equation taking two independent
variables we have also discussed the powerful method or green's function method to find
solution of a linear hyperbolic differential equation in this way, we end module three
of chapter three
so, let us take that transformation as xi and eta so, xi is some function of x and
y, and eta is also some function of x and y and we also assume that xi and eta they are
with the equation with variable coefficients when the equation is given in cauchy-euler form
continuously differentiable, and one important assumption is the jacobian of this transformation
j equals to del xi, eta by del x, y, which can be written in determinant form as xi x,
so, one of the basic assumption in this transformation is the jacobian of this transformation is
not equals to zero if jacobian of this transformation becomes zero then we cannot choose xi and
eta as our independent variables; they will become dependent now, we want to write the
given equation in terms of the new independent variables xi and eta and we are writing the
dependent variable zeta in the transformed space instead of z so, small p which is del
del eta del x
in this module, we shall discuss with a linear second order partial differential
also, q can be written as zeta xi into xi y plus zeta eta
also, we can see the variable t which is del two z del y square, it can also be
these values in the original equation, that means in equation number one, then equation
one is transformed into the form which is written in equation number four, which is
capital a into zeta of xi xi plus two b zeta of xi eta
equation with variable coefficients and we shall show that with some suitable transformation
and the function b is defined as which is written in equation number five, r u one u
two plus half s u one v two plus u two v one plus t v one v two and the function capital f
we get the coefficient of the second order derivatives are related by a relation which
is written in equation number six
b square minus a square is equal to s square minus four rt into j square this j is the
jacobian of the transformation, which is given in equation number three now, i shall discuss
three cases separately first, i am taking the case hyperbolic case, that means when
capital s square minus four rt is greater than zero so, in this case, we think about
the equation r lambda square plus s lambda plus t equals to zero since, s square minus
of the independent variables any second order linear partial differential equation can be
four rt is greater than zero, this quadratic equation the quadratic equation in lambda
has two real and distinct roots
let those roots are lambda one and lambda two now, we choose xi and eta such that xi
x equals to lambda one into xi y and eta x equals to lambda two into eta y now,
think about the equation xi x minus lambda one xi y equals to zero now, the corresponding auxiliary
equation this is a first order partial differential equation so, the corresponding auxiliary
equation is dx by one equals to dy by minus lambda one equals to d xi by zero so, solving
this equation we get d xi equals to zero or xi equals to constant
and the another taking other two variables dx by one equals to dy by minus lambda one,
from this equation we get another equation dy dx plus lambda one, which is function of
transformed into some normal form, and this form is known as canonical form
we get a solution eta x y equals to constant and we get another equation dy dx plus lambda
two x, y equals to zero, which is written in equation number eight so, from these two
constant, and solving eight we get another integral f two x, y equals to zero
zero which is shown in the slide and a eta x, eta y, in the similar way we can show that
xi x, xi y zero, a eta x, eta y equals to zero so, it becomes b square equals to a
and this canonical form is useful to categorize any second order linear differential equation
square minus four rt into j square so, since a square minus four rt is greater than zero
we get b square is greater than zero
zeta eta and this is our required canonical form for the hyperbolic partial differential
differential equation this is the canonical form or the standard form now, we shall take
one example so, this is our given equation which is a second order linear differential equation
now, for this equation capital r is x y, s is minus x square minus y square,
capital t is minus x y
so, a square minus four rt, it can be calculated which is a positive quantity, so, this is
there are three types of canonical forms, they are parabolic, elliptical and hyperbolic
a hyperbolic type equation now, think about the quadratic equation r lambda square plus
s lambda plus t equals to zero so, substituting the values of r, s, t, it becomes the equation
which is shown here so, from this equation the two roots, lambda one and lambda two are
x by y and minus y by x so, our one equation is dy dx plus x by y equals to zero, so it
gives one constant, x square plus y square equals to constant
and the another equation, dy dx minus y by x equals to zero, it gives another integral
x by y is equal to constant so, we can choose the transformation, xi is equal to x square
yy now, substituting these values we can compute the value of a xi x, xi y and its
apart from canonical form i shall discuss a very powerful method which is known as riemann’s
﻿now, i am going to start chapter four
equal to grad square psi one minus grad square psi two so, its value equals to zero in v, and
so, that equals to g minus v that means equals to zero on s now, if we recall
property number one, from that property we can say that the solution of the equation,
that means psi one is equal to psi two on the domain v as well as
now, this is property number four,
and i shall also discuss how to derive laplace equation in different coordinate system
it’s regarding neumann problem it says that if the neumann problem for a bounded region
has a solution, then it is either unique or differs from one another by a constant
so, proof is given here, if possible we assume that there are two distinct solutions,
and del psi one del n equals to some known function h on s and psi two will satisfy
grad square psi two equals to zero in v, and del psi two del n equals to h on s
in the similar manner, we assume a function psi which is difference of the above two functions,
psi one and psi two so, psi equals to psi one minus psi two, and if we see grad square psi
now, i am going to the first slide of module one the laplace equation with n independent variables
one del n minus del psi two del n so, that is equals to h minus h equals to zero on s
if the constant is zero then psi is psi one is unique,
that means psi one is equal to psi two in v so, this proves this property
so, for this case psi the solution may be unique or they may differ from one another by a constant
now, i am going to define spherical mean
let v be a bounded region enclosed by a closed surface s and p be a point within v
so, figure is given here, so p is a point which has coordinates x, y, z
and around p we are drawing a sphere of radius small r, and the surface of the sphere is denoted
can be written as grad square psi equals to zero, where the domain of the function is the set omega
one divided by four pie r square surface integral of psi
d sigma that means we are taking the integral over the surface of the sphere sigma,
and q is any variable point on the surface of the sphere sigma
and d sigma is the element of surface so, this is nothing but average of the value
be a sphere with center at p and radius r such that sigma lies entirely within the domain then
which is subset of r n the equation is written in equation number one
now, there is one important theorem which is known as maximum-minimum principles and these principles
can be proved using the property of harmonic function first, i shall state the theorem
and then i shall prove this theorem so, this theorem states that if
psi be a continuous function in v plus s and it is harmonic in the region v,
which is bounded by the closed surface s and we also assume that psi is not constant everywhere
on v plus s then the maximum and minimum values of psi must occur on the boundary
proof - if possible we assume that psi attains its maximum value m at some interior point p of
some of the values of psi on sigma must be less than m this is the property of having maximum
and the poisson equation is written as grad square psi equals to f,
its spherical average is less than capital m so, it contradicts the fact that it will have the
same value as it is at the point p, hence psi must be constant over the entire sphere sigma
now, suppose q be another point in the domain capital v, now we connect the point q with the
with spheres and using heine-borel theorem for choosing a finite number of covering spheres
we conclude by considering the above argument that psi has the same constant value at q as at p
hence, it is impossible for psi to attain its maximum value at any point inside v so,
it implies that psi must attain its maximum value at some point on the boundary s of v
so, similar argument shows that psi attains its minimum value on s
so, in this theorem, we learnt that maximum or minimum value of the function psi
is attained only on the boundary s of the domain v
now, there is another important theorem which is called stability theorem,
which says that the solution of dirichlet problem depends continuously on the boundary values
proof - let psi one, psi two be two solutions of the dirichlet problem
satisfying the equation, grad square psi one equals to zero together with
the boundary condition psi one equals to g one on the boundary s, and the another solution
psi two will satisfy the laplace equation, grad square psi two equals to zero and it will also
satisfy the boundary condition psi two equals to g two on the boundary s of the region capital v
del square is defined as del two del x one square plus del two del x two square plus del two del
now, we construct a function psi which is equals to psi one minus psi two now,
if we think about the equation satisfied by the function psi is grad square psi is equal to zero
in the region v and psi equals to g one minus g two on the boundary s
s is the boundary hence, at any point within v,
we have for any given epsilon greater than zero minus epsilon less than psi minimum
is less than equals to psi less than equals to psi maximum, which is less than epsilon
that is mod of psi is less than epsilon if the difference of the psi
max minus psi mean is less than epsilon or in other words, we can say that if
g one minus g two mod is less than epsilon on s, then mod of psi one
boundary condition which is in this case mod of g one minus g two, so, in this way we prove this
theorem the solution of dirichlet problem depends continuously on the boundary values
it is sometimes required to find solution of laplace equation in different geometries
in this section, we shall derive the expression of laplace equation in different coordinate systems
like polar coordinate system, spherical and cylindrical coordinate system
so, for derivation we need to go to the slide show now, i am going to derive laplace equation
in plane polar coordinates in polar coordinates system, there are two independent variables,
r and theta so, here we are trying to write the laplacian operator grad square in terms of the
independent variable r and theta, the derivation is shown here the corresponding transformation
because the cauchy problem for laplace equation in a bounded domain v is over determined
is x equals to r cos theta and y is equal to r sin theta so, from this transformation we
can derive that r square equals to x square plus y square, and theta equals to tan inverse y by x
the laplace equation in cartesian coordinate is written in equation number five, psi xx plus psi
yy equals to zero now, to write that equation in terms of r and theta we have to compute psi x,
so, psi x equals to psi r rx plus psi theta, theta x here, we have used chain rule,
so that is equals to psi r into the value of rx is cos theta minus psi theta into sin theta by r
here we have put the value of theta x as sin theta by r similarly, we can derive the value of psi
y using chain rule psi equals to psi y is equals to psi r ry plus psi theta, theta y
so, this equals to psi r into sin theta plus psi theta into cos theta by r
so, here we have used the value of ry and theta y
we cannot specify both psi and its normal derivative, del psi del n
this chapter is devoted to the elliptical partial differential equation
which are given here so, if you take the second order derivative of psi x with respect to x,
in the similar way we can find an expression for psi xx and in the similar way if we take the
second order derivative of psi with respect to y, that means if we compute psi yy
in terms of the derivative of psi with respect to r and theta and if we substitute those values
in equation number five, we will get an equation which is written here psi
rr plus one by r square psi theta theta plus one by r psi r equals to zero
the derivation is not shown here if anyone is interested,
they can go through the e-text of this module the detailed calculations are there,
so we get equation number six this is the laplace equation in plane polar coordinates,
now this is the derivation of laplace equation in cylindrical coordinates
on the surface s of the bounded domain capital v
in cylindrical coordinates, there are three independent variables r, theta and z
independent variables r, theta and z and this is the relation between cartesian
coordinate and the cylindrical coordinates is x equals to r cos theta, y is equal to r sin theta
and z is equal to z so, using this transformation one can transform the equation seven
to equation nine the detailed calculation can be found in e-text,
this is the last one here, we have derived laplace equation in spherical polar coordinates,
and the corresponding transformation is x equals to r sin theta cos phi, y is equal to r sin theta
sin phi and z equals to r cos theta so, using this transformation
we can derive the expression for laplace equation which is written in equation number ten
thus in module one of chapter four, we have discussed about different type of boundary value
problems, namely neumann problem, dirichlet problems, robin problems etcetera we have
discussed about harmonic functions and its properties, and we have also discussed about
maximum-minimum principle and its consequences and lastly, we have derived the expression for
laplacian operator in different coordinate systems in this way, we end this module
now according to the boundary condition, we can categorize the problem into four categories
now according to boundary condition,
we can divide the problems into four categories, so, now i am going to discuss about dirichlet
on the boundary s of a bounded region capital v then the problem is to determine a function
psi, which is function of three independent variables, x, y, z satisfying the equation
i shall take laplace equation and poisson equation for this discussion because these equations come
on the other hand, we can define an exterior dirichlet problem in exterior dirichlet problem,
the function psi will satisfy grad square psi equals to zero outside the region v,
where capital v is a finite simply connected region and on the boundary of v that is
now, i am going to discuss about neumann problem so, in neumann problem, the function psi will
satisfy the equation, the laplace equation, grad square psi equals to zero within v
if it is an interior neumann problem and its normal derivative del psi del n equals to some function h
at every point on the boundary of v that is on s similarly, we can define
exterior neumann problem for exterior neumann problem,
in many fields of mathematical physics like electrostatics, magnetostatics,
psi will satisfy the equation, grad square psi equals to zero outside some region capital v
and on the boundary of capital v, the normal derivative of psi, that means del psi del n
is equals to some known function capital h so, any kind of neumann problem, it may
be an interior problem or exterior problem, is called a second boundary value problem
now, i shall tell about churchill problem in interior churchill problem,
we want to find the value of the unknown function psi, which satisfies the equation,
grad square psi equals to zero within some bounded domain capital v
and on the boundary, that means on s del psi del n plus g psi equals to f,
so, in case of churchill problem, the boundary condition is different from the previous cases
surface waves in fluids and motion of gravitation, motion of particle in gravitation etcetera
when the boundary is given in this form, that means on the boundary, the function,
the sum of the function psi and its normal derivative is defined then it is called
churchill problem in the similar way, we can define exterior churchill problem,
and churchill problem is also called a third boundary value problem
now, i am going to discuss about robin problem
for interior robin problem, we mean we have to find an unknown function psi,
which satisfies the equation, grad square psi equals to zero, within a finite domain capital v
and on the boundary of capital v, that means on s psi is equal to f one on s one and del
psi del n equals to f two on s two, where s is the union of two boundaries s one and s two
in the similar manner, we can define exterior robin problem
and i shall show that there is an important role of boundary condition in the solution of
robin problem is also referred to a mixed boundary value problem or fourth boundary value problem
it is to be noted that the boundary value problem
associated with poisson’s equation can be formulated in a similar way
in this section, we are going to discuss about harmonic function and its properties
in case of three independent variables, the equation is del two psi by del x square
plus del two psi del y square plus del two psi del z square equals to zero a function psi is
said to be harmonic in a closed region r if it is harmonic at all interior point of that region
so, in this section, we shall discuss harmonic functions and its properties apart from that,
poisson’s equation and laplace equation so, it is important to discuss about the
i shall discuss the mean value theorem on harmonic function,
and lastly, i shall discuss about maximum-minimum principle and its consequences
so, for the discussion we have to go to slide show, i have already defined the harmonic function
now, i am going to discuss some properties of harmonic function
the first property it’s written here, if a harmonic function vanishes everywhere on the
boundary of a domain, then it is identically zero everywhere proof is also given here
the value of psi equals to zero on the boundary s of v now using green’s identity
boundary condition together with the solution of a laplace equation, thus, the entire chapter
now, we have to note that grad square psi equals to zero in the domain capital v, and psi equals
to zero on s so, if we use the condition grad square psi equals to zero in v, the first integral
in the left hand side is equals to zero now, using the condition psi equals to zero
and grad psi is also a real quantity, so this implies that grad psi must be equals to zero
so, psi must be equals to zero in v using the continuity condition,
so this property is proved here
is divided into three modules in module one, i shall discuss about different boundary conditions,
similarly, we can prove the another property, this is property number two
in the domain v this property can be proved in the similar way as we have done
dirichlet problem for a bounded region has a solution, then it is unique
i shall prove this property here, so if possible let there are
two different solutions, psi one and psi two for the interior dirichlet problem
that means psi one will satisfy the laplace equation, grad square psi one equals to zero in v
and psi one equals to some known function g on the boundary s and there is another solution psi two,
which will satisfy the laplace equation, grad square psi two equals to zero in v
apart from that i shall discuss about harmonic function and its application
﻿we know that laplace equation comes in the problem of potential theory in some problems
now, i am going to discuss about the solution of a neumann problem neumann problem means we have
to solve the laplace equation together with the boundary condition and in the boundary condition
instead of the unknown function phi the normal derivative of the unknown function phi,
psi are prescribed on the boundaries so, the corresponding problem is written here,
so you have to solve del two psi del x square plus del two psi del y square equals to zero
at any interior point of the rectangle zero less than equals to x less than equals to a,
zero less than equals to y less than equals to b, subject to the boundary condition del psi del x
in cartesian coordinates the laplace equation is given in equation number one now, we are going
at the point zero y equals to del psi del x at a y equals to del psi del y
at the point x zero equals to zero and del psi del y at the point x b equals to f x
here, we also assumed that the fourier cosine series expansion of small f x exist
so, in this case we are considering neumann problem in a rectangle
now, i am going to tell about the solution of that problem we have already seen that
if solution four and five are not acceptable for rectangular boundaries so, we have to
take solution six which is given here psi equals to c one cos p x plus c two sin p x
into c three e to the power p y plus c four e to the power minus p y
now, if we use the boundary condition del psi del x at zero y equals to zero,
then it gives that c two equals to zero and del psi del x at a y equals to zero
to solve equation one using the useful technique known as method of separation of variables
because sin of n pi equals to zero for all n equals to zero one two dot, dot
and if we use the boundary condition del psi del y at x zero equals to zero
these gives c four equals to c three, hence the solution satisfying the above boundary conditions
now, the only boundary condition we need to apply is del psi del y at x b equals to a f x
can be obtained using the orthogonality property of the cosine series so, to get the constants a n
we need to multiply f x with cos n pi x by a and then we need to integrate over zero to a
in that method we assume the function psi as product of two function capital
thus, the solution of the interior neumann problem is given by psi equals to a naught plus sum
n equals to one to infinity a n cos n pi x by a sin hyperbolic n pi y by a,
where a zero is arbitrary constant and a n is given which is written here
now, i am going to discuss about solution of laplace equation in polar coordinate
system the laplace equation in polar coordinate system, which we have derived in module one
of this chapter is written in equation number eleven here we are using the same techniques,
the method of separation of variables so, psi is written as product of two function capital r
and theta, which are functions of small r and small theta respectively
so, substituting this expression for psi in eleven we can separate the equations
for capital r and capital theta, which is written in equation number twelve
now, let k is the separation constant, so the equations for capital r becomes
r square, d two capital r d r square plus small r d r d r minus p square capital r equals to zero
and if you see this equation this is an ordinary differential equation
and it is given in cauchy euler form so, with some transformation that means if we
substitute r is equal to e to the power u so, in terms of the independent variable u that equation
can be transformed into an ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients and that can
the power p plus c two r to the power minus p and the equation for theta is d two theta d theta
so, assuming the solution in the form which is written in two,
square plus p squared theta equals to zero and we can find its solution easily as theta is equal to
combination of sine function and cosine function which is written here
so, the solution psi becomes c one r to the power p plus c two r to the power minus p into c three
cos p theta plus c four sin p theta so, in case one we have taken k as a positive constant
now, for the second case we are assuming k as zero so, in similar way we can prove that the
expression for capital r is c five log r plus c six and theta is c seven theta plus c eight
and psi consequently psi becomes c five log r plus c six into c seven theta plus c eight
now, for the case when k is less than zero, the solution becomes which is written in equation
number fifteen so, for polar coordinates the solutions can be written in three different forms,
which are retained in equation number thirteen, equation number fourteen and equation number
if we substitute this expression in equation one, equation one can be written in the form,
fifteen and all these expressions the c j, j equals to one to twelve are constants
now, we are taking a boundary value problem specifically interior dirichlet problem
for a circle the interior dirichlet problem for a circle is defined as follows,
we have to find the value of the single valued function which is continuous that function is psi
and which satisfies the laplace equation and on the circular region that means on r equals to a
psi satisfies some boundary condition which is written here, psi a theta equals to f theta
for zero less than equals to theta less than equals to two pi
and f theta is a continuous function of theta
since psi is a single valued function,
it will satisfy the periodicity condition that means psi r theta plus two pi
which is written in equation number three that means, one by capital x
must be equals to psi r theta, for zero less than equals to theta less than equals to two pi
now, we note that r equals to zero is a point of the domain of definition of the problem
and we know that log r is undefined at r equals to zero
so, if you see the solution, the solution in polar coordinates can be written in three different
forms, we have already derived that so, if you look at those forms,
so if we look at the form which is written in equation fourteen,
this solution is undefined at r equals to zero so, solution which is written in
equation number fourteen is not acceptable and if we look at the solution which is
written in equation fifteen here is also the solution is undefined at r equals to zero
so, the solution fourteen and fifteen are not acceptable
so, the only solution we can think about which is retained in equation number thirteen
so, starting from equation number from the solution which is written in equation number
thirteen, we need to apply the boundary condition and the periodicity condition
so, if we apply the periodicity condition in equation sixteen it gives c three cos p theta
equals to c four psi plus c four sin p theta is equal to c three cos p two pi plus theta
plus c four sin p two pi plus theta so, after simplification we get the values of p is equals
to n, where n is zero, one two, three, that means all positive integer values and zero
now, using the principle of superposition the solutions psi can be written as sum over n c n
r to the power n plus d n r to the power minus n into a n cos n theta plus b n sin n theta
again you can see that psi r theta is finite at r equals to zero
let’s say a constant k, where k is called the separation constant
so, it is possible only when d n equals to zero so, substituting d n equals to zero and
defining the constants in this way which is written here we get or we can write down the
equation in the form the solution in the form psi equals to half a zero plus sum over n r to the
power n a n cos n theta plus b n sin n theta now, we are applying the boundary condition
which says that psi at r equals to a theta equals to f theta so, satisfying this condition we get
f theta equals to half a zero plus sum of n equals to zero to infinity a n
a to the power n into a n cos n theta plus b n sin n theta so, from this expression it is clear
that this is the fourier series expansion of the function f theta so, the coefficients
a n b n can be obtained using the fourier transformation like which is written here
now, if we equate one by x d two x dx square is equal to k, we will get an equation
of potential theory the physical conditions are such that they are identical in some planes
function cos n theta and sin n theta, we get the expression for a n b n, which are written here
now, it is to be noted that there is an infinite series in the summation and we want to find the
sum of the value of this sum to find the value of this sum we assume c as this, sum
power n into sin n phi minus theta now, if we calculate c plus i s
r by a is less than one and mod of e to the power i phi minus theta is also less than one
so, the sum of the gp series can be written in this form r divided by one minus r so,
this is written here now, if we
equate the real part and imaginary part from the both side we can get the expressions for c and s
since we are interested to find the value of c, we equate the real part from the right hand side
and we get the value of c which is written here
therefore, the solution psi becomes one by two pi integration over zero to two pi a square
minus r square f phi by a square minus two a r cos phi minus theta plus r squared d phi,
where r is less than a this integral is known as poisson integral formula
and this gives a unique solution of the interior dirichlet problem for a circle
now, i am going to discuss exterior dirichlet problem for a circle the exterior dirichlet
problem for a circle is defined as follows, we have to find the value of the
square equals to k, we will get another equation d two y dy square plus ky is equal to zero
function single valued function psi which is also continuous at any point exterior of a circle r is
equal to a, which satisfies the laplace equation which is written in equation number eleven,
for r greater equals to a, zero less than equals to theta less than equals to two pi
and it will psi will satisfy the boundary condition psi a theta equals to f theta,
where f theta is continuous function of theta and psi is bounded as r going to infinity
now, there is a difference between an interior dirichlet problem and an exterior dirichlet
their term is not bounded as r going to infinity so, the solution is of the form
which is written in equation number twenty and in the solution you can see that the term
r to the power minus n is present, because these term is bounded as r going to infinity
now, this separation constant k may take different values so, according to the values of the
now, if we use the boundary condition psi a theta equals to f theta we get f theta equals to half a
zero plus some n equals to one to infinity a to the power minus n a n cos n theta plus b n sin n
thus the solution of exterior dirichlet problem becomes psi equals to which is given here
then proceeding exactly as we have done in the earlier case in case of interior
dirichlet problem, we can obtain the value of the infinite series and we finally subsequently
we can get the expression for psi which is written here psi equals to one by two pi
integration zero to two pi r square minus a square f phi by r square minus two a r cos phi minus
theta plus a square d phi, for r greater than a, and this is our required solution
now, i am going to discuss interior neumann problem for a circle so, for this case
separation constant k, three cases may arise so, first we take the case where k is positive
we have to find the continuous function psi, which satisfies the laplace equation
together with the boundary condition, where the normal derivative of the function psi
is prescribed so, we have to solve the laplace equation eleven together
with the boundary condition del psi del n equals to for this case it is del psi del r
equals to g theta, where g theta is some continuous function of theta
since phi must be bounded at r equals to zero,
we take the solution in this form where r to the power minus n term is missing and you have to
consider only r to the power n term so, solution is written here and so this solution can be
written in the form which is written in equation number twenty one, where the constants
so, in case one k is equal to some p square, where p is a real number
condition we set it which says that del psi del r equals to g theta
so, using that condition we get g theta equals to sum over n n a to the power n minus one into a n
cos n theta plus b n sin n theta, it is again a fourier series expansion of g theta so, using
the theory of fourier series we can obtain the values of a n and b n, which is written here
therefore, solution becomes psi equals to half a plus integration zero to two pi g phi
into the infinite sum of r by a to the power n a by n pi to cos n phi minus theta
d phi again we can find the value, value of this infinite sum using the procedure,
which we have done in the earlier cases assuming c as the sum and s as the sum and
then computing c plus i s you can find the value of the infinite sum, then equating the real part
of the previous expression from both sides we get the expression for c which is written here thus
so, the corresponding equation becomes d two x dx square minus p square x equals to zero
psi equals to half a minus a by two pi integration zero to two pi log of one minus two r by a cos phi
minus theta plus r square minus a square g phi d phi, where r is less than a
now, i am going to discuss about the laplace equation in spherical polar coordinates,
where the independent variables are r theta and phi,
in some cases there is some axial symmetry in the problem so, for that case
there is a symmetry about the polar axis theta equals to zero and psi is independent
of phi so, the laplace equation
in spherical polar coordinate becomes which is written in equation number twenty three
again we are using the method of separation of variables to find solution of this equation
so, we assume psi as product of function r and theta where r theta are function of small r and
and its solution is capital x equals to c one e to the power px plus c two e to the power minus px
small theta respectively and the surface theta is called the zonal surface harmonic
so, if you substitute twenty four into twenty three, we get the equation, we can
separate the expression for capital r and capital theta, which is written in twenty five like k is
the separation constant and we are substituting the value of k as n into n plus one
so, if you substitute that we get the r equation,
equation for capital r which is written in equation number twenty six and equation
for capital theta which is written in equation number twenty seven
equation number twenty six is an ordinary differential equation, which is in cauchy euler
form so, its solution can be obtained easily now, if we look at equation number twenty seven
we need to substitute mu equals to cos theta now, the equation taking mu as independent
and the solution of d two y dy square plus p square y equals to zero is capital y equals
variable equation twenty seven reduces to the form which is written here d d mu of
one minus mu squared d theta d mu plus n into n plus one into theta equals to zero
this is famous legendre equation and we know the solution of legendre equation is legendre function
or legendre polynomials so, the solution is written in equation number twenty nine
so, this is linear combination of legendre functions of first kind and second kind
thus, the solution can be written using the superposition principle psi is equal to sum over
n a n r to the power n plus b n r to the power n plus one into c n p n mu plus d n q n mu
thus in module two of chapter four, we have discuss about the solution of a two dimensional
laplace equation using the method of separation of variables we have discussed the cases
taking different coordinate systems like cartesian coordinate system,
to c three cos py plus c four sin py so, the solution of the original equation
polar coordinate system and spherical polar coordinate system we have also shown that
that means solution of equation one is psi is equal to capital x into capital y, so that
which are parallel to a given plane for example, let us take that given plane
equals to c one e to the power px plus c two e to the power minus py into c three cos py plus
c four sin py where, all c j's are constants, for j equals to one, two, three, four
now, come to the case when k equals to zero
c five x plus c six and the y equation becomes in the same form d two y dy square equals to zero,
so it's solution is c seven y plus c eight, so psi becomes c five x plus c
square which is a negative number where p is a real constant so, for this case
till now we have discussed about the solution of a two dimensional laplace equation
but we didn't discussed about the boundary condition of those problem
now, we are going to discuss about the dirichlet problem of laplace equation
that means we have to find the solution of equation number one together with the boundary condition
which is shown here so, here we are assuming the boundary is a rectangle, so the value of psi are
given in the boundaries y is equal to zero, y is equal to b, x equals to zero and x equals to a
and the boundary conditions are written here psi at zero y equals to psi
at a y equals to psi at x b equals to zero and psi at x zero equals to some known function f x
thus this is an interior dirichlet problem
the function del psi del z and del two psi del z square is identically equals to zero
where you have to find the solution of laplacian equation, grad square psi equals to zero
in the interior points of the rectangle zero less than equals to x less than equals to a
and zero less than equals to y less than equals to b, subject to the boundary conditions
which are written in equation seven and we also assume that f x can be expanded
in fourier sin series now, if we consider this boundary condition seven, if we use the first
gives we have to put x equals to zero and x equals to a, so it gives c one, if we put
x equals to zero we get c one plus c two equal to zero if we put x equals to zero in equation four
we get c one plus c two equals to zero and if we put x equals to a in equation four
we get c one e to the power pa plus c two e to the power minus pa equals to zero
thus, the laplace equation becomes del two psi del x square plus del two psi c del y square equals to zero
so, those two equations are written here, so if we solve these two equations
we get the solution c one equals to c two equals to zero so, the function psi becomes zero
so, this psi is a trivial solution of the laplacian equation, but we are not
interested to the trivial solution, so to find the non-trivial solution we have to think about
the other two solutions which are written in equation number five and equation number six
now, consider the solution five, so in that solution if we put the condition psi zero
y equals to zero and psi a y equals to zero, this leads to the solution again psi equals to
zero thus, the solution four and five are not acceptable
so, the only solution remains is the solution six so, if we look at the solution six,
so this is our solution six so, in this solution if we put the boundary
so, this is the laplace equation in two dimension thus, in module two of chapter four
into sin pa into c one one e to the power p y plus c twelve e to the power minus py equals to zero
since we are looking for a non-trivial solution c ten is not equal to zero
and the expression which is written in the bracket this cannot be zero, so the only option remains is
sin pa equals to zero and we know the solution of this equation is sin pa equals to zero equals to
where n takes the values one, two, three, four, dot, dot
so, for all values of n this is the solution of the laplacian equation
so, since laplace equation is a linear equation, so linear combinations of all the solution is
also the solution of the laplace equation and this is called the superposition principle
we are going to discuss about the solution of a two dimensional laplace equation
so, using superposition principle we can write the solution as psi equals to sum
of n equals to zero to infinity sin n pi x by a into a n e to the power n pi y by a
plus b n e to the power minus n pi y by a but, we need to apply another two boundary
conditions, one of them is psi xp equals to zero so, if we use this boundary condition
we can express the constant b n in terms of n which is written here, b n equals to minus a n
by e to the power minus n pi d by a into e to the power n pi b by a
therefore, the expression for psi becomes psi is equal to half sum over n a n sin n pi x by a
the constant a n is equals to two a n exponential of n pi b by a
for the discussion we have to go to the slideshow first of all i am going to discuss about the
which we want to satisfy so, that boundary condition is psi x zero equals to f x
n pi b by a and from this summation you can see that the right hand side is nothing but,
the fourier series expansion of the function f x in terms of the sin series
zero to a, we will get the coefficient using the orthogonality property of sin function a
so, from the last equation we can get the values of the unknown numbers capital a n
thus the required solution of the interior dirichlet problem
solution of laplace equation in cartesian coordinates
﻿i am going to start module three of chapter four, in module two of chapter four, i have discussed
now, you have to remember that, there is one boundary condition left
so, to satisfy that boundary condition and that boundary condition is psi x, y, c,
equals to f x, y now, if we apply this boundary condition to our solution,
is given here so, if you see this expression you can see that this is very known series and
this is called the double fourier series so, the coefficients a m, n can be obtained
in cartesian coordinate system, cylindrical coordinate system,
in this way, we have to multiply this series with sin m pi x by a into sin n pi
y by b from in both sides and then integrate over zero to a and zero to b, that will give
the values of m, n, through this relation and to find the values of a m, n, we have to use
the orthogonality property of sin functions so, using that property, we can find the values of
are for m equals to one to infinity, n is from one to infinity, and these lambda m n is
given here pi into square root m square by a square plus n square by b square and a m n
can be determined from the relation which is given here thus this is our required solution
in cartesian coordinate system
and spherical polar coordinate system first i shall discuss about cartesian
now, i am going to solve laplace equation in cylindrical coordinate system in cylindrical
coordinate system laplace equation is written in the form which is given in equation number five
here we shall use the same technique, the separation of variables method
to find the solution, for that purpose we have written psi as product of functions
capital r, capital theta and capital z, where r, theta, z are functions of small r,
small theta, and small z, respectively so, if you substitute the expression for psi
from six to equation five we get the equation, which is written in equation number seven
so, our aim is to separate the variables, so for that purpose first we separate
coordinate system for that, now we have to go to the slide show as i have told
capital z equals to c five e to the power m z plus c six e to the power
minus m z, where c five, c six are constants
so, from equation seven, we have already separated the variable z,
one by theta d two theta, d theta square equals to minus n square so, here n square is the another
separation constant so, the equation for theta becomes d two theta, d theta square
plus n square theta equals to zero and its solution is theta equals to
c three cos n theta plus c four sin n theta, where c three and c four are constants
but, there is another equation, which is equation in r
we want to find solution of a three dimensional laplace equation in different coordinate systems
minus n square by r square, capital r equals to zero and this is very famous equation
and this equation is known as bessel’s differential equation and we know that the solution of bessel’s
differential equation is the bessel function so, the solution is written as capital r is equal
first and second kind respectively therefore the solution of laplace equation in cylindrical
coordinates becomes xi equals to product of capital r, capital theta and capital z
and these are the expressions for capital r, capital theta and capital z
now, we want to solve a physical problem, where we can use cylindrical coordinate system
so, this is the example, a homogeneous thermally conducting cylinder occupies the region
zero less than equals to r less than equals to a, zero less than equals to theta less than equals
i shall use the technique, the separation of variables method to find the solution
to two pi and zero less than equals to z less than equals to h, where small r, small theta,
small z, are cylindrical coordinates and the boundary conditions are like this, the top
base z equals to zero is held at hundred degree temperature and we also assuming in this problem,
that there is no source of heat generation within the cylinder so, we have to find
for this problem the steady temperature distribution within the cylinder
the temperature we have to find the temperature psi, which is a single valued function and this
is for steady state, and this psi will satisfy the laplace equation grad square psi equals to zero,
where zero less than equals to r less than equals to a, zero less than equals to theta
now, the laplace equation in cartesian coordinates can be written as grad square psi,
less than equals to two pi and zero less than equals to z less than equals to h
and the boundary condition is given that psi equals to zero at z equals to h
and psi is equal to zero at r equals to a and there is third boundary condition,
which is psi equals to hundred at z equals to zero so, from the
boundary condition, we can note that the solution cannot depends on the variable theta
so, it can be assumed that the solution is independent to theta, also it is to be noted that
order n and of second kind and this bessel function has a singularity at r equals to zero
since in this physical problem there is a point r is equal to zero
so, it y n is not defined that r equals to zero, thus we need to omit the term y n
which is equals to del square psi, del x square, plus del square psi, del y square, plus del
and the solution is independent to theta so, to make it independent to theta,
we must have to take n equals to zero therefore from the general solution
we can write the solution for this particular problem as psi equals to c one
so, that solution is written here, but we have adjusted the constants in this way, this is a
j zero into a e to the power m z, plus b into e to the power minus m z
now, if we use the boundary condition psi equals to zero at z equals to h,
then we get the relation between a and b as b equals to minus a e to the power two m h
the power m z minus h, minus e to the power minus m z minus h, or it can be written in the form psi
square psi, del z square equals to zero in the method of separation of variables,
now, we need to satisfy another boundary condition, which says that psi equals to
zero at r equals to a so, it gives j zero m a equals to zero so, this is a bessel function of
the value of m a, as xi k or m equals to xi k by a, where k equals to one, two dot, dot
therefore, using the principle of superposition, we can write the general solution as psi equals to
is psi equals to hundred ad z equals to zero so, it gives the relation hundred equals to sum over k
the coefficient of bessel function bk we need to multiply the relation with
of bessel function, we obtain the relation which is written here,
minus xi k h by a into a square by two j one square xi k
here we have used the orthogonality property of the bessel function, that property is written
is j one, so if we use this property we can replace the integration in the left hand side
here by j one, so replacing that we get the relation which is written here
so, from this relation we can easily find the value of bk, so it is written here
where x, y, z are functions of small x, small y, and small z, respectively
about solution of two dimensional laplace equation but, two dimensional laplace equation
this, so these are the values of bk, so that solution is written here
and you have to remember that this xi k are the roots of the equation j zero xi equals to zero
now, i am going to discuss the solution of laplace equation in spherical polar coordinate system
the laplacian in spherical polar coordinate system is given in equation number nine
here we are applying the same method, the method of separation of variables to find the solution
so, first we are separating variables r and the variable theta phi, that means we
are separating the variable r from theta and phi so that is given by the relation ten
so, if you substitute ten in nine we obtain the equation which is written in equation
phi, so in this way we are separating and we are assuming that lambda is the separation constant
now, equating the expression for r which is written here is equal to minus lambda
we get the equation for capital r which is written in equation number twelve
and if you see this is famous cauchy euler equation so, the solution of this equation
can be assumed in the form capital r equals to r to the power m and this small m can be determined
so, substituting this value of lambda we obtain two values of m as n and minus n plus one
thus, the solution of r equation or the solution of equation twelve is capital r is equal to c one
r to the power n plus c two divided by r to the power n plus one now, we have to find solution
in equation number three so, if we observe this equation,
for capital f which is written in equation number thirteen
we have already assumed the value of lambda as minus n into n plus one,
so we are putting the value of lambda here now, we are again applying the method of
separation of variables, so we are writing f as product of capital theta and capital phi
and we are substituting sixteen to fifteen to obtain a relation which is written in seventeen
here we are separating the variables phi and theta from this relation in this way
so, in the left hand side we have only the function of phi and right hand side it is
only the function of theta and to equate this left hand side is equal to m square and this
expression is equal to m square and we get two equations which are written here
so, from the phi equation we can obtain the solution easily as phi is equal to c three cos
we wrote the equation in terms of y and z term, in the left hand side
axi-symmetric case that means for that case if m is equal to see the equation number eighteen,
if we put m is equal to zero in this equation capital phi becomes a constant that means for that
case solution does not depend on the variable phi, so this case is called the axi-symmetric case
now, this is the equation for capital theta and from this equation we substitute,
we make a change in the independent variable through this relation, mu is equal to cos theta,
so if you substitute this in this equation in terms of the independent variable mu we obtain
the equation which is written here and if you see this equation, this is
legendre equation but there is some extra terms here and we know that solution of this equation
is the associated legendre function therefore, solution of that equation
of equation three and the term involving the variable small x is written in the another side,
can be written as linear combination of two legendre function, associated legendre function
which is written here theta mu as c five p n m mu plus c six q n m mu where p n m
and q n m are associated legendre function of first and second kind respectively or in
terms of theta we can write the function in this way which is written in equation number nineteen
thus, the general solution of laplace equation
can be written in this way psi equals to sum over m sum over n c one r to the power n plus
c two r to the power n plus one into c three cos m phi plus c four sin m phi into p n m cos theta
in particular for axi-symmetric case it doesn't depend on phi, so the general solution can be
written as psi which is function of only r and theta, so it is sum over m sum over n
c one r to the power n plus c two divided by r to the power n plus one p n m cos theta
now, i shall discuss a physical problem where spherical polar coordinate comes so,
this is the problem we have to find the value of psi at any point in the interior of a sphere
r equals to a such that it's laplacian is equals to zero over this region and
the boundary condition is psi at r equals to a is given by the function small f
now, if we look at the general solution of the spherical polar coordinate which is written in
satisfies the given boundary conditions since r is equal to zero is a point within the sphere,
so the solution must exist, exist at r equals to zero, but if we see the general solution,
this solution does not exist at r equals to zero if c two is not equals to zero
so, we take c two equals to zero so, the solution can be written in this form,
lambda one square is the separation constant so, if we equate one by x,
so only r to the power n term is there and all other terms are present which is written
in equation number twenty two now, to satisfy the boundary condition we have to put r equals
to a and value of psi is f, so if we substitute this, if you satisfy this boundary condition
first to obtain a m n you have to multiply this relation with cos m pi into p n m mu
and then integrate over minus one to one zero to two pi this, then you get
now, using the orthogonality property of the legendre function, associated legendre function
we can write the value of minus one to plus one p n m mu square d mu and all other terms will
be zero due to orthogonality property and here also only cos m pi term will be there,
d two x, d x square is equal to minus lambda one square we get the ordinary differential equation
all other terms will be zero due to orthogonality property of fourier modes
so, using those property we can obtain the values of a n m, this is the expression, so we get
integration minus one to one zero to two pi f p n m mu cos m pi d mu d phi is equal to two pi a
to the power n a m n m plus n factorial divided by two n plus one n minus m factorial so, from this
equation we can obtain the value of m n easily similarly to obtain the value of b m n
expression for b m n, so which is written here, so we can obtain both a m n and b m n
in this way thus the solution becomes psi is equal to which is written here
we can make a simplification like this, we can write the cosine function and
sin function together to make it as cos of m chi minus phi, so this is our final solution
or the required solution of the given problem thus, in module three of chapter four we have
discussed about solution of three dimensional laplace equation in cartesian coordinate system,
cylindrical coordinate system and spherical polar coordinate system
we took three examples for three different cases and for all the cases we considered dirichlet
problem for cartesian coordinates system the solution is double fourier series, for cylindrical
coordinate system the solution is bessel fourier series and for spherical polar coordinate system
we can find solution of this ordinary differential equation easily and the solution is written here
capital x is equals to c one cos lambda one x plus c two sign lambda two x, where
another separating constant lambda two square so, if we equate d two y minus one by y
d two y d y square equals to lambda two square we get an ordinary differential equation,
which is written here d two y d y square plus lambda two square
y equals to zero and we can easily write the solution of this equation, which is written here,
capital y is equals to c three cos lambda two y, plus c four sin lambda two y,
laplace equation thus in this module we shall solve a three dimensional laplace equation
square into z, where lambda three square equals to lambda one square plus lambda two square
of capital x, capital y, and capital z so, it is written here in equation number four
now, i shall consider one example where laplace equation comes
in cartesian coordinates so, here is that example, find the potential function psi
it is to be noted that in reality, we need to solve laplace equation for many geometrical problem
in a rectangular box define by zero less than equals to x, less than equals to a,
zero less than equals to y less than equals to b, zero less than equals to z less than equals to c,
if the potential is zero on all sides and bottom while psi equals to f, on the top of the box
like this, if psi represent the potential function, which is function of x y and z
so, psi at x equals to zero is equal to zero, psi at x equals to a is equal to zero,
psi at y is equal to zero is equal to zero, psi at y is equal to b is equal to zero,
which is represent by represented by the function small f
for example, if there is an experiment in a box, we need to consider cartesian coordinate systems
now, we are going to solve this problem together with the supplied boundary conditions
we have already derived the solution of laplace equation in cartesian form,
which is written in equation number four
now, if we apply the boundary condition psi at x equals to zero equals to zero and psi at a,
x equals to a equals to zero, the equation number four reduces to
c one so, here we put x equals to zero so, if we put x equals to zero it becomes c one,
so psi at x equals to zero equals to zero implies c one equals to zero and the other condition
now, c two cannot be zero, because we already got that c one is zero,
but c two cannot be zero, if c two is zero, then psi becomes zero for all x, y, z
and if there is an experiment in a pi, we have to consider, or it is convenient to use cylindrical
so, that is a trivial solution, but we are not interested in trivial solution so, we assume
that c two is not equals to zero therefore to satisfy the second boundary condition,
by a, where m is a positive integer now, think about the third boundary condition,
y is equal to zero so, if we put y is equal to zero, then it becomes the second expression
so, we get c three equals to zero and in the similar way, if we apply
coordinate systems therefore it is necessary to find solution of laplace equation taking
this boundary condition psi x, y is equal to b z equals to zero, then it will give
sin lambda two b equals to zero so, c four with the similar argument, we can say
that c four cannot be zero, otherwise it will give a trivial solution so,
we get the only option to satisfy the boundary condition is sin lambda two b equals to zero
so, it implies that lambda two b must be equals to m into pi, where m is
an integer, or in other words we can say that lambda two can takes the values
n pi by b, where n is an integer now, we have two more boundary conditions
the condition psi x, y, zero equals to zero leads to the condition c five
different geometrical problems or in different coordinate systems
c six sin hyperbolic lambda three z, or we can write these three constants together
as constant a so, psi is equal to a sin lambda one x,
now, we have one condition,
now we note that in this solution this lambda one, lambda two are not arbitrary,
plus lambda two square so, if we substitute the values of lambda one and lambda two, we get the
values of lambda three as pi into square root of m square by a square, plus n square by b square
and you can see that, the values of lambda three depends on the values of m and n,
thus in module three objector four, we shall discuss about solution of laplace equation
now, i am going to start chapter five this chapter consist of the discussion on parabolic
psi attains its maximum at a point in the boundary that means at a point in del r where
region smaller which is the upper boundary in this figure which is nothing but the line
t is equal to tau
maximum at the point x bar tau, so its first order derivative is zero and second order derivative
the heat conduction or diffusion equation is given by the partial differential equation,
at the point x bar tau is less than equals to zero
now, psi at the point x bar tau is greater equals to psi at the point x bar t tau minus
neighborhood of x bar tau is, must be less than the value of psi at the point x bar tau
this is the property of having maxima of a function and this delta can lie in between
minus delta minus psi x bar tau divided by minus delta
now, the numerator of this expression is less than zero using the property which is written
here so, this is less than zero minus delta less than zero so, we get this ratio is greater
k nabla square t is equal to del t del t, which is written in equation number one, where
value of this quantity we have just obtained is greater equals to zero
and we also found that psi x x, x bar tau is less than equals to zero therefore, the value of
this expression that means l dash psi becomes a non-negative number that means
this is greater or equals to zero, which again contradicts the result which is written in
in the region r so, again we get that l dash psi is greater equals to zero for a point
in the region small r which contradicts the result which is written in equation seven,
which says that l dash psi is less than zero
nabla square is the operator which is equivalent to del two del x square plus del two del y
is less than equals to capital m plus epsilon l square
therefore, psi is less than equals to capital m plus epsilon l square so, for any point
in the region capital r we obtain psi less than equals to m plus epsilon l square now,
putting the value of psi as t plus epsilon x square, so this is less than equals to capital m
plus epsilon l square so, capital t is less than equals to capital m plus epsilon
into l square minus x square on capital r
if you take epsilon tends to zero, we obtain t, x, t is less than equals to capital m on
capital t in the region gamma or in other words, we can say that maximum of the value
capital t in the region capital r is attained in the region gamma
is the proof of maximum-minimum principle for one-dimensional heat equation now, using
the maximum-minimum principle i want to state the uniqueness theorem so, this is the statement
initial condition t, x, zero equals to fx and boundary conditions t zero, t equals to g
arise so, let us consider that capital t represent the temperature at a point in a
of their domains of definition, then the solution of this system is unique
and the other one is t two so, t one and t two, these two solutions will satisfy the
heat equation six and they will also satisfy the initial and boundary condition now, we
consider another function, v which is equals to t one minus t two
now, it is easy to prove that the function v will also satisfy the heat equation which
is written in equation number six in the region zero less than equals to x less than
equals to capital l, zero less than equals to t less than equals to tau and is a continuous
function of x and t now, if we think about the initial condition for the function v,
t one at x zero is fx and t two at x zero is fx, so it becomes zero
so, v at x, zero is equals to zero for zero less than equals to x less than equals to
zero, t, which is equals to g one t minus g two t g one t minus g one t, so it becomes
zero and similarly, v at l, t is equals to zero in zero less than equals to t less than
principle we can say that the maximum and the minimum value of v, t are attained in
the region gamma and it is given that in the region gamma the value of v, t is zero
therefore, the maximum and the minimum value of v, t in the whole region capital r is equals to zero
so this implies that t one minus t two is equals to zero in the region capital
r or in other words, t one is equal to t two in the region capital r so, it says that
the solution is unique there is another important theorem which is stability property or stability theorem
it says that the solution of the heat equation six for the dirichlet conditions
which is defined by t, x, zero equals to fx for zero less than equals to x less than equals
on the initial and boundary conditions
thus, in module one of chapter five we have discussed about the occurrence of heat equation
in many physical systems we have also discussed the maximum-minimum principle for one-dimensional
heat equation using that principle we proved that the solution of heat equation is unique
we have also stated that the solution depends continuously on initial and boundary condition
now, we end this module
partial differential equation the mostly occurred parabolic differential equation is
small t, denotes the amount of heat generated due to radioactive decay or absorption of
where kappa is defined as k pi rho c
the equation is written in equation number two and if you observe equation two, this
is nothing but heat equation so, for this case conduction of heat in a solid we get
heat equation we shall take another example that is shown here so, this is the process
heat equation or the diffusion equation the phenomena of diffusion occurs in many natural
so, we get again heat equation for the diffusion process in an isotropic substance
as curl of velocity
systems like diffusion of heat, diffusion of velocity in fluid flows, etcetera
and this is the last example where i want to show that we again get heat equation
in this example, we consider the propagation of a long waves in a good conductor, then
the components of electric field vector capital e will satisfy the equation, del e del t equals
to nu gratt square e, where e is the electric field vector
equation therefore, we have seen taking four different examples that heat equation or the
therefore, it is important to study the heat equation or the diffusion equation
diffusion equation arise in many physical problems in last section, we have discussed
about the occurrence of heat equation in many physical problems
now, i am going to discuss the maximum-minimum principle for one-dimensional heat equation
and its consequences the maximum-minimum principle has been discussed in chapter four
occurred in the boundary of the region of harmonicity of the function the similar type of
now, in this section, i am going to discuss the maximum-minimum principle and its consequences
del t of capital t is equal to kappa del two t del x square, which is written in equation
the entire chapter is divided into four modules in module one, we shall discuss about the
of capital t which satisfies the heat equation which is written in equation number six
let capital r is the region given by zero less than equals to x less than equals to
capital l and zero less than equals to t less than equals to tau and this is a closed rectangle
t, capital r such that t equals to zero or x equals to zero or x equals to l
occurrence of heat equation in many physical systems in module two, three and four, we
is attained in the region gamma
region gamma we shall show that maximum of capital t over the region capital r is less
than equals to capital m to prove this we consider an auxiliary function psi is equal
r minus gamma, we have l dash psi where l dash is the operator
del del t minus kappa del two del x square so, if we operate l dash on psi,
so, if we operate l dash on epsilon x square, the first term del del t term will
shall discuss about the solution of diffusion equation in one-dimension, two-dimension
contribute zero and the next term del two del x square will give the value two so,
so it becomes a negative number which is given by equation number seven
for psi, psi is equals to t plus epsilon x square and we know that maximum of capital
is less than equals to capital m plus epsilon l square if psi attains its maximum at an
to del del t of psi at the point x one, t one minus kappa del two psi del x square,
x one, t one
the first term is zero and the second term means the value of del two psi del x square
is negative because we have assumed that psi attains its maximum at the point x one, t
one therefore, del two psi del x square at the point x one, t one is a negative number
let that negative number is minus capital k so, the value of l dash psi at the point
x one, t one becomes greater or equals to zero and which contradicts the result which
is given in equation seven seven says that for any x, t belongs to r minus gamma, l dash
l dash psi is greater equals to zero so, which is a contradiction, so the contradiction
arrives because we assume that psi attains its maximum at an interior point, x one, t one
we are going to the power point presentation of this module
now, i am going to start module two of chapter five this module is devoted to the study
outside the surface we have to show the expression for capital t which is written here, where
erf is the error function
so, the problem can be written as we have to find the function capital t which satisfies
the one-dimensional heat equation which is written here subject to the initial condition
t, x, zero equals to t zero for a less than x less than b where t zero is some constant
or the fundamental solution, the expression for capital t can be written in this way
now, the range of y is minus infinity to plus infinity but for this problem
b so, we can put the value of fy as t zero within the range a to b and outside this
minus of x minus y by two square root kappa t is equal to xi
so, we are transforming the variable from y to xi, so in terms of the variable xi the
integral becomes this which is written here and the corresponding the limit also change
now, this integral can be written in this way we can break the integral in this way
so, this is t zero by two, two by square root pi zero to b minus x pi two square root kappa
t to the power minus xi square d xi minus two by square root zero to a minus x by two
square root kappa t to the power minus xi square d xi
and this function is known as error function so, the first integral can be written as error
slide of this module
square root kappa t thus, we get the required solution for capital t for this particular
problem now, one-dimensional heat equation in cartesian coordinate can be written in
this form which is given in equation number thirteen
here, we are again using the method of separation of variable so, t is assumed as product of
capital x and tau, where capital x and tau are functions of x and t respectively so,
substituting the expression for capital t in equation thirteen we obtain the equation,
one by x d two x, d x square equals to one by kappa tau, d tau dt so, in this way we
are separating the variable x and t let lambda be the separation constant
so, the equation for capital x and tau becomes d two x d x square minus lambda x equals to
we are considering one-dimensional wave equation which is written in one, del t del t
all, we assume that the separation constant lambda is a positive number so, lambda is
greater than zero so, lambda can be written as lambda equals to mu square, where mu is
a real constant so, putting this value of lambda the equation for capital x becomes
d two x dx square minus mu square x equals to zero so, the solution can be written as
x equals to c one e to the power mu x plus c two e to the power minus mu x
and the solution for tau can be obtained easily as tau t equals to c three e to the power
kappa mu square t, where c one, c two, c three are integrating constants so, substituting
the values of capital x and tau in the original equation we get the expression for capital
t as a e to the power mu x plus b e to the power minus mu x, into e to the power kappa
equals to kappa del two t, del x square, where x varies from minus infinity to plus infinity
mu square t, where capital a is equal to c one, c three and capital b equals to c two, c three
now, i am going to the second case where lambda equals to zero so, if lambda equals to zero,
the solution for capital x becomes c one x plus c two and the solution for tau becomes
tau equals to constant, which is equals to c three therefore, the required solution
to c two, c three
now, the last case when lambda is less than zero, so lambda can be written as minus mu
square where mu is a real constant so, capital x becomes c one cos mu x plus c two sin mu
x and the tau is equal to c three e to the power minus kappa mu square t so, the solution
for this case can be written as t is equal to, which is given in this slide here we
also modified the constant c one, c two, c three in this way capital a is c one, c three
and capital b is c two, c three
system so, in this problem, there is a uniform rod of length l whose surface is thermally
insulated and initially it is in temperature t is equal to t zero at time t is equal to zero,
one end is suddenly cooled to t is equal to zero and subsequently maintained at this
temperature the other end remains thermally insulated and we have to find the expression
for capital t
so, this is a one-dimensional problem so, we have to find solution of one-dimensional
heat equation which is written here subject to the initial condition capital t, x, zero
one divided by square root two pi kappa t, exponential of minus x minus xi square divided
equals to t zero where x is zero, lies between zero and capital l capital l is the length
of the rod and the boundary condition is t at the end x equals to zero it is zero
and the other end this is insulated, so the normal derivative of the temperature del t, del x
is zero for t greater than zero
coordinates, this is the general solution capital t is equal to a cos mu x plus b sin
mu x, e to the power minus kappa mu square t now, we need to satisfy the boundary condition
and the initial condition for this problem so, if we satisfy the boundary condition t,
zero, t equals to zero, so it gives capital a is zero and the boundary condition del
t del x, l, t equals to zero it gives cos mu l equals to zero
by four kappa t, is a solution of equation one
and we know the solution of cos mu l equals to zero gives mu l equals to two n plus one
into pi by two so, this gives the value of mu as mu equals to two n plus one into pi
into pi square t, into sin of two n plus one by two l, pi x
using the principle of superposition the linear combinations of all solution is also the solution
of the original equation thus, we obtain the expression for capital t as sum over n,
use the initial condition t, x, zero equals to t zero so, using that initial condition
we obtain t zero equals to sum over n b n sin two n plus one by two l into pi x
if we compute del t del t and del two t, del x square from the expression two and put in
so, this is a very well-known series and this is called the half-range fourier sin series
and we know how to find the constant b n from this half-range fourier series so, to obtain
then we need to integrate over zero to l that will give the value of b n as four t
in plane polar coordinate, the heat equation takes the form so, there are two independent variables
with one is time t and another one is the radius vector small r so, now we are
going to apply the same process, the method of separation of variables
equation one, it will satisfy equation one and the solution which is written in equation
for that we are writing capital t as product of capital r and tau and substituting this
expression in the equation eighteen we obtain the equation which is written here, one by
r d two r d r square plus one by r d r, d r equals to one by kappa tau, d tau dt so,
in this line, we separated the variable r and t and now we are assuming the separation
constant as mu square so, this equals to mu square gives two ordinary differential
equation one is in capital r, other one is in tau
so, the equation in capital r is d two r d r square plus one by r d r d r plus mu square
r equals to zero and the equation for tau is written here the solution of the tau equation
is very easy to find and the solution tau is equal to c three e to the power minus kappa
mu square t now, if we look the equation for capital r this is again a bessel differential
of one-dimensional parabolic equation the example of parabolic partial differential
equation of order zero so, its solution is the linear combination of two bessel’s functions
of first and second kind
of the equation is capital t is equal to a j zero plus b y zero into e to the power minus
kappa mu square t, where capital a is equal to c one, c three and capital b is equals
to c two, c three in this section, we shall discuss about the solution or one-dimensional
heat equation in spherical polar coordinates
the heat equation in spherical polar coordinates can be written we are again using the method
of separation of variables to find solution so, we substitute capital t as capital r into
tau, so substituting that we get then equation which is written here let mu square is the
you see the solution, we can observe that t, x, t is an analytic function of x and t
separation constant so, equating mu square is equal to the r equation and tau equation
the equation becomes d two r, d r square plus two by r d r d r plus mu square r equals to
zero and the tau equation becomes d tau dt equals to minus kappa mu square tau
it is easy to find solution of the tau equation this is the exponential function so, the
solution can be written as tau equals to c one, e to the power minus kappa mu square
t now, to solve the r equation we need to substitute capital a as variable as smaller
into capital r now, the r equation becomes to the equation in terms of the variable capital
s as d two s d r square plus mu square s equals to zero
for all t greater than zero and it is positive for all x
where capital a is a one c one and capital b equals to b one c one so, this is the general
solution of heat equation in spherical polar coordinate system
therefore, in module two of chapter five we have discussed about the solution of one-dimensional
heat equation firstly, we have discussed about the fundamental solution of the heat
coordinate systems in cartesian coordinate system, the solution is the fourier modes
and in plane polar system the solution is the bessel function and in spherical polar
system we obtain the solution in terms of the fourier modes thus we end module two
of chapter five
thus, the entire x axis is the region of influence for this parabolic equation
to infinity so, these are the properties of the fundamental solution of equation one
now, we want to find solution of equation one together with the initial condition t,
so, we put capital t is equals to capital x into capital tau so, if we substitute this
one by capital x, d two x, dx square is equal to one by kappa tau, d tau dt so thus, we
equation which occurs most frequently in nature or any physical system is the heat equation
separate the variables or the functions capital x and tau in this way let the separation
or we can find the value of tau as c into e to the power kappa lambda t
from the physical point of view we assume that f x tends to zero at mod x tends to infinity
and the value of capital t is bounded that means mod t is less than m as mod x tends
to infinity so, t, x, t to remain bounded, we have to take lambda negative so, for that
thus putting lambda is equal to minus mu square the expression for tau becomes tau equals
to c e to the power minus kappa mu square t now, there is another equation in capital
or the diffusion equation thus we have considered heat equation for the entire discussion in
x which is written here, d two x, d x square plus mu square x equals to zero and whose
are constant so, the general solution of capital t becomes, t equals to a cos mu x
plus b sine mu x into e to the power minus kappa mu square t, where we modified the constant
as capital a is equal to c c one and capital b is equal to c c two
since f x is, in general, non-periodic, we consider fourier integral instead of fourier
series so, instead of summation we are considering integration also, a and b
are arbitrary we consider them as function of mu now, we have to consider all possible
values of mu thus, the principle of superposition gives the summation of all product solutions
capital t equals to integration of zero to infinity, capital t, x, t, mu d mu
this module we have taken one-dimensional heat equation because one-dimensional equation
to integration zero to infinity a mu cos mu x plus b mu sin mu x, into e to the power
minus kappa mu square t d mu we have the initial condition, t, x, zero equals to fx
if we see the equation seven, this is, we can use the fourier integral theorem
the fourier integral theorem says that f u is equal to one by pi, integration zero to infinity,
is easy to solve and the idea can be extended to solve the problem in two dimension and
sin b now, we separate the integral into two different as sum of these two terms as
one by pi integration zero to infinity cos mu x minus infinity to plus infinity f y cos
mu x plus b mu sin mu x d mu, where a mu equals to if you see the previous expression, so
one by pi integration minus infinity to plus infinity f y cos mu y dy and b mu is one by
pi minus infinity to plus infinity f y sin mu y dy
three dimension
infinity to plus infinity f y cos mu x minus y dy, d mu so, the expression for capital
or the general solution of capital t is t is equal to one by pi zero to infinity minus
infinity to plus infinity f y cos mu x minus y, e to the power minus kappa mu square t
e to the power minus kappa mu square t cos mu x minus y d mu, dy
now, capital t is equal to one by pi integration zero to infinity, integration minus infinity
to plus infinity f y cos mu x minus y, e to the power minus kappa mu square t dy, d mu
now, in this step, we are interchanging the order of integration so, it becomes equals
to one by pi integration minus infinity to plus infinity f y, integration zero to infinity
e to the power minus kappa mu square t, cos mu x minus y d mu, dy
apart from that there is some physical situation where heat flows only in one direction therefore,
now, we want to compute the integral which is written in this square bracket in the
last section, we have discussed about fundamental solution of a one-dimensional heat equation
of variables method the separation of variable methods is a very powerful method
it can be applied in a wide variety of partial differential equation
using this technique i shall solve one-dimensional heat equation in cartesian coordinates, plane
polar coordinates and spherical polar coordinates so, for that discussion we have to go to the
slide show we know the relation, zero to infinity e to the power minus z square cos
two b z dz equals to root pi by two, e to the power minus b square we can obtain this
relation or the value of the expression which is written in the left hand side using the
it is worthy to study the one-dimensional heat equation in this module, we shall first
property of gamma function, where b is real
now, in this relation, if we substitute z as mu into square root kappa t and b is equal
to x minus y by two into square root kappa t, it becomes zero to infinity e to the power
minus mu square kappa t cos mu, x minus y d mu is equals to the expression which is
we obtain capital t is equals to one by two square root pi kappa t, integration minus
infinity to plus infinity fy, e to the power minus x minus y whole square divided by four
kappa t dy
now, we shall take one example in this example, this is a one-dimensional infinite solid
derive the fundamental solution of one-dimensional heat equation, then we shall use the separation
﻿today, i am going to start module three of chapter five in module one of chapter five,
j and y are bessel’s functions of first kind and second kind respectively
hence, the solution of equation four, that means the original equation is
the constant c and d are defined as c equals to c one e and capital d equals to c two e
now, we shall take one example where we can use the solution of heat equation in polar
coordinates so, this is the example we have to find the temperature in a long cylindrical region
bounded by the surfaces r equals to a, theta equals to zero and theta equals to pi
so, in these three surfaces are maintained at zero temperature and
its initial temperature is given by the function small f
of this module the heat equation in cartesian coordinates is given by equation one,
so, for solution we have to go back to the general solution which is written in equation number seven
this equation is valid for all r but, in our present problem this equation,
the solution must valid for r equals to zero
therefore, we have to take the value of constant b equals to zero
so, from general equation we can write the solution for our present
into e to the power minus kappa mu square t now, we have to use the boundary conditions
so here we have considered only two independent variables, x and y now, we shall apply
the boundary conditions are given that capital t is equal to zero at theta equals to zero
equals to pi gives sin lambda pi equals to zero, so which implies that lambda must be
an integer so, let lambda equals to n and here we have taken only positive integer values
so, n equals to one, two, dot, dot there is one more boundary condition which is temperature
equals to zero at r equals to a so, this leads to the equation j lambda mu a equals to zero
and we have already found that the value of lambda is an integer so, this implies j n mu a equals to
can be written using the principle of superposition as capital t equals to sum over i,
the method of separation of variables for that we write the solution capital t
capital t, r theta zero equals to small f, r, theta so, if we use this initial condition
we need to integrate over zero to a this is the range for smaller and zero to pi this is
the range for theta so, if you do this using the orthogonality property of bessel’s function
n plus one square, mu i a into pi by two where we have used the orthogonality property?
the orthogonality property for bessel function is written in the first equation and in the second
as product of three functions, capital x, capital y and tau, which are functions of small x,
equation the orthogonality property of sin function is given so, in this way we can
find the values of a n i the expression for a n i is written in the last equation
thus the solution or the required solution of the problem is capital t is four by
e to the power minus kappa mu i square into t, where b n i is given by the equation
which can be seen here now, i am going to discuss
the solution of heat equation in spherical polar coordinate system the equation in spherical polar
coordinate system is written in equation number eight so, now we are using the same procedure
that means we are writing the variable capital t as product of capital r, capital theta and tau
and we substitute t in equation eight to obtain equation nine
small y and small t respectively now, if we substitute
if you observe equation nine, again we are separating the variable tau from r and theta
and here we are assuming the separating constant as minus mu square because we
want a bounded solution and the solution for tau can be obtained easily as tau equals to e
e to the power minus kappa mu square t now the equation, our next aim to separate the
variable capital r and capital theta, so for that purpose we separate that in equation number ten
now, the equation in capital r and capital theta are written in equation number eleven
and equation number twelve so, if you observe equation number eleven, in this equation if you
do the substitution, mu r, capital r equals to mu r to the power minus half, into s r
in terms of the variable capital s, the equation becomes d two s d r square
the value of capital t in one, we get an equation which is written in equation number two
plus one by r, ds dr plus mu square minus n plus half whole square by r square into s
if we observe the r equation, this equation is not in standard form so, we give the transformation
from capital r to capital s to obtain an equation in capital s which is very known equation
so, the solution of this is famous bessel’s equation and the solution of this equation
bessel’s functions of first kind and second time kind respectively and both the functions of order
as mu r to the power minus half into s r, which is written in the last equation of this slide
at equation number twelve, this is not so much familiar to me, but if we give a transformation,
cos theta equals to mu dash, the equation twelve deduces to the form which is written in the first
first, we separate the time variable from x and y variable for that purpose
equation and this is known to all of us this equation is known as legendre equation
and we all know that solution of legendre equation is legendre function so, theta can
be written as linear combinations of two legendre functions of first kind and second kind
functions of first and second kind respectively so, if we substitute the values of capital r,
original equation as capital t equals to sum over n mu r to the power minus half,
plus d n dash q n cos theta into e to the power minus kappa mu square t
the function of x and y are written in the left hand side of that equation
to make the concept more clear so, in this example, we have to find the
temperature distribution in a sphere of radius a where its surface is kept at
zero temperature and its initial temperature is given by the function small f, r, theta
so, if we go back to the general solution which is written in equation number thirteen,
so from this general solution we shall try to find the solution which satisfies this particular
boundary condition and the initial condition in the general solution, if you observe
there is the bessel function of second kind which is unbounded at r equals to zero therefore,
to get the bounded solution we need to put the value of b n dash as zero
again if we see the legendre functions, the legendre function of second kind is undefined
at theta equals to zero so to, incorporate this fact, we have to
and the function of t is written in the right hand side now, let the separation constant is minus
take the value of b n dash equals to zero therefore, equation thirteen
reduces to the form, capital t equals to sum over n, a n into mu r to the power minus half, j
n plus half mu r, p n cos theta into e to the power minus kappa mu square t
now, we shall use the boundary condition
the boundary condition is given that the temperature is zero on the surface of the sphere,
let the solution of this equation is mu one a, mu two a, and mu n a
therefore, the solution can be written using the superposition principle as
capital t equals to sum over n, sum over i, a n i mu i r to the power minus half,
j n plus half mu i r, p n cos theta, e to the power minus kappa mu i square into t
mu square here we have chosen the separation constant as a negative number
we have discussed about the occurrence of a parabolic partial differential equations
now, to find the values of the unknown constant a n i we need to apply the initial condition
which is given here the temperature at time t equals to zero is determined
by the function small f which is function of r and theta so, if we use these initial condition,
we obtain the relation, small f equals to, which is written here and if you see this,
this is a double series and this is mixture of bessel series and legendre series
with p n cos theta and then integrate over minus one to plus one and the result is written here
because we want a bounded solution so, if we see the equation of tau, it becomes
and then integrate over zero to a now, using the orthogonality property of bessel
function and legendre function we obtain the relation which is written in the first equation
and from this equation we can easily get the values of a n i which is written
in the last equation hence, the required solution is capital t is sum over i, sum over
j n plus half mu i r, p n mu dash e to the power minus kappa mu i square into t
so here, we have just substituted the values of a n i and we have defined the variable b n i
so, this is our final or the required solution for the given problem thus in module three of
chapter five we have discussed about the solution of a two-dimensional heat equation in different
d tau dt equals to minus mu square kappa tau and the solution can be written easily
coordinate systems, namely cartesian, plane polar, and spherical coordinate system
we have used the method of separation of variables to find the solution
in cartesian coordinate system we obtained double fourier system, we obtained mixed bessel fourier
series and in spherical polar coordinate system we obtained mixed bessel and legendre series
in this way we end this module
as tau equals to a one e to the power minus kappa mu square t, which is a bounded solution,
where a one is the integrating constant now, our aim is to separate the variable small x and small
y for that purpose we separate in this way, which is written in the slide and we again consider
another separation variable as minus p square so, equating minus p square to the function of x,
one by x d two x dx square, we get the equation d two x dx square plus p square x equals to zero
and d two y dy square plus q square y equals to zero, where q square can be written in terms of
mu square and p square as q square equals to mu square minus p square and these two equations
in many physical problems among all physical problems the heat equation or the diffusion
therefore, the solution of two-dimensional heat equation in cartesian coordinate can
be written in the form which is given in equation number three, where we have modified the constant
in this way, capital c is assumed as c one a one and capital d as d one a one
now, we shall take one example where we can apply this type of solution
so, the example is presented here the boundaries of the rectangle
zero less than equals to x less than equals to a and zero less than equals to y less than
equals to b are maintained at zero temperature and initially, it is given that the temperature
has the value small f, x, y we have to find the temperature profile for t greater than zero
now, we are trying to find the solution of the above physical problem
equation comes most frequently for that reason, in this module we have considered heat equation
so, the temperature is given by the division equation which is written in the first equation
now, we have to solve this equation together with the supplied initial
conditions and the boundary condition the initial condition is given as capital t,
zero, y, t equals to capital t, a, y, t equals to zero for zero less than y
less than b and t greater than zero and capital t, x, zero, t equals to capital t
x, b, t equals to zero for zero less than x, less than a and for all t greater than zero
the boundary condition is given by, so these are the boundary conditions the initial condition
is given by capital t, x, y, zero, that means at time t equals to zero
temperature takes the functional form small f, x, y, where f is unknown function
now, the solution of two-dimensional heat equation can be written as we have obtained in the
or the diffusion equation for our discussion moreover, in some physical situation,
last discussion as capital t equals to a cos px plus b sin px into
c cos qy plus d sin qy into e to the power minus kappa mu square t, where mu square equals to p
square plus q square now, if we apply the boundary condition t at x equals to zero,
so in this equation we get, if we put x equals to zero, then we get a equals to zero
similarly, t at y is equal to zero, equals to zero gives
so, if we put y is equal to zero in this expression that will give capital c equals to zero
thus, the general solution deduces to this form,
capital t x, y, t equals to bd sin px sin qy e to the power minus kappa mu square t
there are, also two boundary conditions which are t at x equals to a equals to zero
so, if we apply this condition in the above expression, we get sin p a equals to zero
the problem can be considered as a two-dimensional problem therefore, the module three of chapter
so, this gives p equals to m pi by a, where m is a positive integer
now, using the superposition principles since heat equation is a linear
partial differential equation we can apply the principle of superposition to find the
plus q square which is equals to pi square into m square by a square plus n square by b square
of m and n both so, to find the values of a m n we need to apply the initial condition
five is devoted to find the solution of a two-dimensional heat equation in this module,
the initial condition is given that the value of capital t at t equals to zero is small f, x, y
so, if we apply this initial condition, we obtain a relation in the form, small f, x,
y equals to sum over m, sum over n, a m n sin m pi x by a, sin n pi y by b
and from this expression it is clear that this represent a double fourier series particularly,
so, using that we can obtain the values of a m n as a m n equals to two a into two by b
thus, the solution can be written as capital t is sum over m, sum over n, capital f m, n,
sin m pi x by a, sin n pi y by b, e to the power minus kappa mu m n square t,
where capital f m, n is nothing but capital a m, n
we shall use the method of separation of variable to find the solution and we shall find solution
and the expression for capital a m, n is given in the slide
now, we are going to discuss the solution of heat equation in plane polar coordinate system
the equation in polar, heat equation in polar coordinate system
is given in equation number four now, we shall use the same procedure, that means the method of
separation of variables to find solution for that we again write capital t as product of
three functions, capital r, capital theta, and tau, where capital r, capital theta
and tau are functions of small r, small theta and t respectively
now, substituting capital t in equation number four
we obtain an equation which is written in equation number five
so, in this process our aim is to first separate the variable small t so, the function
in different coordinate systems, namely, cartesian plane, polar and spherical coordinate system
a which is, so the expression which is function of t is written in the right hand side
and we assume the separation constant as a negative number as minus mu square so, solution
now, it remains to separate the variable capital, the function capital r and capital theta
so, in the next step or in equation six we have separated the function capital r and capital theta
and we assume the separation constant as lambda square so, if we equate it with the
theta equation and capital r equation we obtain two equations which are written in the slide
and the theta equation is very easy to solve thus, the solution of theta equation is written
here, c one cos lambda theta plus c two sin lambda theta
first, we shall start with cartesian coordinate system so, let us go to the first slide
in last two modules, we have discussed about the solution of one dimensional and two dimensional
the solution which is written here, capital theta equals to c cos nu theta plus d sin
r where j nu and y nu they are bessel functions of order nu and of first kind and second kind
capital theta, capital z into tau
now, we shall take one example where these type of equation may arise, so this is the
example so, in this example there is a cylinder which is bounded by the planes z equals to
zero and z equals to one and the curved surface r is equal to a in the cylindrical coordinates
r, theta, z and its faces are maintained at zero temperature so, z equals to zero and
of variables to find solution so, for that purpose, we write capital t as product of
z equals to l, faces are maintained at zero temperature and the curved surface at the
temperature fz
so, for this physical situation we have to find the steady temperature distribution within the cylinder
so, we have to establish this relation to solve this problem, first we
t del small t equals to zero, also for this physical situation the temperature is symmetric
about z axis so it is independent of theta
of separation of variable for that capital t is written as product of two functions capital
capital x, capital y, capital z and tau which are functions of small x, small y, small z
r, capital z where r, z are function of small r and small z respectively
so, substituting this expression in this equation, we obtain a relation which is written in the
r and capital z which are written in the first line of this slide
so, if we observed this equation the solution of this equation can be obtain easily, so
where i zero and k zero are modified bessel functions of first and second kind respectively
and t respectively
and you can observe that the order of the function is zero so, these are bessel functions of order zero
partial_differential_equations_6223
again you can notice that the bessel of second kind k zero has singularity at r equals to
we get c one equals to zero the first initial condition gives c one equals to zero
the second initial condition capital t r, l equals to zero gives sin lambda l equals
to zero so, this restricts us to take the values of lambda as lambda equals to n pi
so, substituting this expression in one we obtain an equation which is written in equation
equals to a has the distribution f, z
equation by n sin n pi z by l, and then we need to integrate over zero to l, then using
the orthogonality property of sin function we can obtain this relation which is given here
by this equation which is written in this slide now, i am going to discuss about the
solution of heat equation in spherical polar coordinate system the heat equation in spherical
polar coordinate system is given by equation number nine again we are using the same procedure,
the method of separation of variables to obtain the solution
so, if we substitute the expression for capital t which is written here in equation nine,
we obtain an equation which is written in equation number ten as usual we do we first
separate the time variable part, so the tau, the function of tau is written in the right
side again to get a bounded solution we take the separation constant as a negative number
can obtain the expression for tau, as tau equals to g e to the power minus kappa mu square t s
now, this is the another equation, so to separate, first we separate the phi equation from r
to get bounded solution we assume the separation constant at minus mu square, where
and theta equation and we take nu square as our separation constant so, equate the phi,
equate the last these two quantity that means d two phi d phi square plus nu square phi
equals to zero we obtain the solution as phi is equals e one cos nu phi plus e two sin nu phi
now, we need to separate the variable capital r and capital theta
so, for that purpose we write the equation in this form and we are taking the separation
constant as n into n plus one, equating this with the expression for r and with the expression
in theta we obtain the equations in r and theta which are written in equation number
twelve and equation number thirteen respectively
in the independent variable, in the dependent variable r we can obtain a bessel function
and the solution can be written in this form capital r equals to mu r to the power minus
order n plus half and of first kind and second kind respectively
the equation transform to this equation which is written here and this is very famous equation
and the solution of this equation is associated legendre function, therefore solution can
be written as linear combination of associated legendre function of first kind and second
of nu dash
g e to the power minus kappa mu square t, where g is the integrating constant
associated legendre functions of the degree n now, substituting the values of capital
r, capital theta and capital phi we obtain the required solution which is written here,
g and f is f one capital g so, this is our required solution so, this is the solution
of heat equation in spherical polar coordinate system
now, we are going to solve a problem, for that purpose we take this example, we have
to find the temperature t in a sphere of radius a where its surface is maintained at zero temperature
function of second kind we know that this bessel function of second kind is not defined
or unbounded at r equals to zero so, for this particular problem we can choose the
value of b as zero
so, for that reason we have taken the value of b as zero and from the general solution
you can see that the legendre, associated legendre function of second kind is also undefined
jn plus half mu a equals to zero and let mu one, mu two these are the roots of this equation
heat equations but, these type of questions may arise in some particular cases therefore,
distribution is given by the function f r, theta so, f r, theta is equals to this this
is obtain by putting t is equal to zero in the previous expression
now, this relation will give the value of cnm for that purpose you can see that this
is a mixed bessel legendre series now, using orthogonality property of bessel’s function
need to use the solution of heat equation in spherical polar coordinate system so,
in this problem we have to find temperate t in a sphere of radius a where its surface
lambda square so, the z equation becomes d two z dz square plus gamma square z equals
is maintained at zero temperature and the initial temperature is given by the function
small f
if we go back to the general solution of heat equation in spherical polar coordinates system,
since inside the sphere, r equals to zero is a point and we know that bessel function
of second kind is unbounded at r equals to zero, therefore from the general solution
for this particular problem we can choose the value of b as zero
theta is equal to zero is a point, but the legendre function of second kind is undefined at theta
which is given that the surface r equals to, on the surface r equals to a
temperature is also zero
to zero so, that equation is written here and we assume that the solution of these equations
are mu one, mu two dot dot, these are the roots so, using the principle of super position
the solution for this particular problem can be written as which is shown in this slide
in the first equation, capital t equals to sum over n sum over m cnm mu nm r to the power
now, these are the unknown constant in the solution to obtain the values of unknown
constant we need to apply the initial condition for this problem it is given that initially
the temperature is given by the function small f, that is in the general expression if we
put t is equal to zero we get the function small f so, in this expression if we put
t equals to zero, so it becomes f and the right hand side is given here
now, from this expression it is easy to find the values of cnm to find the values of cnm
we have to apply the orthogonality property of the bessel function and legendre function,
so if we use that we can obtain the value of cnm, therefore general solution can be
written in this form which is given in the first equation and cnm can be obtain from
the last equation using the orthogonality property
thus in module four of chapter five, we discussed about the solution of a three dimensional
heat equation in cartesian coordinate system, cylindrical coordinate system and spherical
coordinate system in cartesian coordinate system the solution is a triple fourier series,
in cylindrical coordinate system the solution is mixed bessel, fourier and hyperbolic function
but in case of spherical coordinate system the solution is mixed bessel, fourier and
legendre function thus, we end module four of chapter five
are written here the constant beta square is defined as lambda square minus alpha square
therefore, the required solution is given by capital t is equal to the expression which
is written here where we have substituted the values of capital x, capital y and capital
z and tau so, the equation, the solution is written in equation number four
and in this solution we have redefined the constants as follows, capital e is equal to e one g
and capital f is equals to f one g and the constant mu square is defined as alpha square
plus beta square plus gamma square
coordinates so, in this problem the faces of the solid parallelepiped which are bounded
by the wall x equals to zero, x equals to a, y is equal to zero, y is equal to b and
z equals to zero z is equals to c and these boundaries are kept at zero temperature
an initial temperature is given by the function small f, so this small f function is known
to the discussion on the solution of three dimensional heat equation
to solve this problem, we need to go back to the general solution of heat equation which
now, we need to find the values of the arbitrary constant a, b, c, d, e and
f for these particular problems, so these, the values of these constants can be obtained
using the boundary conditions and the initial condition
the boundary condition is given t at x equal to zero, t at y is equal to zero, t at z equals
to zero is zero and t at x equals to a is equal to t at y is equal to b is equal t at
we get the values of constant a, c, e as zero
b equals to zero and sin gamma c equals to zero and these three equation gives the values
here, we have taken only positive integral values of m, n and q and in the expression
if we go back to the general solution there is one term, exponential term with t which
is kappa into mu square, so for this particular problem we assume that lambda square is kappa
into mu square so, these problem it becomes kappa pi square m square by s square plus
m square by b square plus q square by c square
so, if you substitute these values of the unknown constant, the solution can be written
three different coordinate systems to find solutions we shall find solution in cartesian
the suffix m, n, q is given here because the value of capital k depends on m, n and q
now, we have one more condition which is the initial condition for this problem which we
have not used, that condition is written here capital t x, y, z, zero is equal to small
obtain a relation which is written here, small f equals to this expression
rather you can say that this is a sin series, triple sin series, so the value of
k can be obtained using the orthogonality property of sin series so, to obtain k we
coordinate system, cylindrical coordinate system and spherical coordinate system
and integrate over zero to a, zero to b and zero to c and then we get the expression for
the constant capital k which is shown here
square t, where capital f which is function of m, n and q is given by the equation which
is written here
system the equation heat equation in cylindrical coordinate system is written
in equation number five, we are using same method, the method of separation of variable
first we shall start with cartesian coordinate system
thus, we substitute t which is written in the form as product of capital r, capital
is written in equation number six
hand side and we assume the separation constant as minus mu square to get a bounded solution
and solving it we get the expression for tau as capital g e to the power minus kappa mu
for that purpose we write the equation in the form which is given in equation seven
and we assuming the separation constant as lambda square to obtain the equation in z which is written here
and the solution of this equation is written here capital z equal
so, let us go to the first slide of module four the heat equation in three dimensional
to e one cos hyperbolic lambda z plus f one sin hyperbolic lambda z, where e one, f one
are arbitrary constants
now, we remain to separate the function capital r and capital theta so, in this step we are
again going to separate capital r, capital theta taking mu square as our separating constant
so, the equation for capital theta becomes d two theta d theta square plus mu square
theta equals to zero and the equation in the variable capital r is written here d two r
equals to zero, where the constant, capital r alpha square is defined as lambda square
plus mu square
now, we are trying to find solution for capital r and capital theta the theta equation gives
coordinate system is written in equation number one we shall use the method of separation
﻿today i am going to start module one of chapter six the chapter six is devoted to the theory of
the total derivative which is equivalent to del del t time derivative plus derivatives in space
and neglecting the nonlinear terms we get the equation which is written in
equation number eleven, rho zero del v del t equals to minus c square rho zero grad s
now, if we think about the continuity equation, the continuity equation is given by
ddt of rho plus rho divergence of v equals to zero
so in terms of small s and v and neglecting the nonlinear terms
to our first slide as i have told that one of the most important hyperbolic equation is the wave equation
the continuity equation reduces to the form which is written in equation number twelve,
rho zero del s del t plus rho zero divergence of v equals to zero
now for irrotational motion of the gas there exists a scalar function phi
such that the velocity v can be written as gradient of the scalar function phi,
so v is equal to minus grad of phi and if we substitute this value of v in equation eleven
which is shown here,
it reduces to the form gradient of del phi del t minus c square s is equal to zero
del s del t equals to grad square phi which is written in equation number fourteen
now eliminating s between the equations thirteen and fourteen we obtain the wave equation which
the wave equation is given by del two phi del t square equals to c square grad square
for sound waves in space we again get the wave equation, three-dimensional wave equation
the expression for these are written, you can see in the slide and the tangential stress components
we can see two constants lambda and mu, they are known as lame constants
phi which is written in equation number one and this c represent the wave speed
now, in absence of body force the equation of motion can be written in the form del del x of tau
if the displacement vector v is expressed in the form v is equal to gradient of phi
plus curve of psi so displacement is divided into two parts, one is the gradient curve
and another one is the curled curve so if we substitute eighteen,
in sixteen we get the equation del two phi del t square equals to c one square grad square
given by c one square equals to lambda plus two mu by rho and c two square equals to mu by rho
this c one and c two are known as longitudinal and transverse wave speed respectively so if
now if we assume a solution of equation one in the form small phi equals to capital phi
now, i shall discuss how wave equation can arise in electromagnetic problem
now, let us express the magnetic field capital h and the electric field e in the form h as curl
now, the maxwell equations are given by these four equations
which are written here, where rho is the charge, i is the current and c is the velocity of light
now, if we substitute the expression which is written in the first line,
as you can see in the slide, grad square a equals to one by c square
one by c square del two phi del t square minus four pi rho
into e to the power i k c t that means we are assuming a periodic solution
now, in absence of charges that means in the first equation if i equals to zero the equation reduces
to del two a del t square equals to c square grad square a and in the second equation
phi satisfy the wave equation which is written in equation number twenty
thus, in module one of chapter six we have discuss about the occurrence of wave equation
electromagnetic waves etcetera therefore, it is important to study
in equation number two, grad square plus k square phi equals to zero and this special
equation is called helmholtz's equation or the space form of the wave equation
hyperbolic differential equation amongst all hyperbolic equation the wave equation
uniform tension capital t the string, in the equilibrium position, coincides with the x axis
let the string be disturbed slightly from its equilibrium position and y which is
function of x and t denotes the transverse displacement from the equilibrium position
then this transverse displacement y will satisfy the one-dimensional wave equation
which is written in equation number three, del two y del t square equals to c
is the tension of the string and rho is the uniform density of the string
suppose we want to solve this problem together with the condition
occurs most frequently in many physical problems chapter six is divided into five modules
to solve the equation three together with the boundary condition y a, t equals to zero
whose axis coincides with the x axis such that each point of a typical cross section of the bar
takes the same displacement xi, then xi will satisfy the one-dimensional wave equation
is given by the hooke’s law the hooke’s law says that stress is proportional to strength,
so which is written in this equation sigma equals to e into del xi del x where del xi del x
represent the strain and e is the proportionality constant which is known as young's modulus
in module one we shall discuss about the occurrence of wave equation in many problems in physics
we also assume that
the bar for zero less than equals to x less than equals to a is held at rest initially
by the wave equation which is written in equation number four
together with the initial condition xi equals to zero and del xi del t is equal to zero
at t equals to zero and for zero less than equals to x less than equals to a
and we have the boundary conditions del xi del t equals to u, t
at x equals to zero and del xi del t equals to zero at x equals to a
in module two we shall discuss about solution of one-dimensional wave equation
thus, we need to solve wave equation four together with the initial conditions
which are written here and the boundary conditions which are given in the last line
now, we are going to discuss how wave equation can come in some electrical problem
for this problem we consider the flow of electricity in a long insulated cable so that the
then, the fall of potential in a linear element delta x which is situated at a point small
where r is the resistance per unit length and capital l is the inductance per unit length
now if we divide this relation by delta x and take the limit as delta x tends to zero,
we get the differential equation
in module three we shall discuss about solution of two-dimensional wave equation
again for a capacitance c to earth and conductance capital g per unit length,
again we are dividing this equation by delta x and take the limit as delta x tends to zero,
we obtain the differential equation which is written in equation number six,
and equation six we obtain a second-order partial differential equation
and in module four we shall discuss about the solution of three-dimensional wave equation
g equals to zero, then the above equation or if we observe equation eight we can see that
and this is nothing but one-dimensional wave equation where the constant small c square
is possible to get wave equation or a hyperbolic differential equation in electrical problem
now we are going to discuss about the sound waves problem,
lastly in module five we shall discuss about general solution of a wave equation
x such that each point of that section has the same longitudinal displacement xi x, t,
the suffix zero here denote the value of dp d rho in equilibrium state
therefore the above equation reduces to the form del two xi del t square equals to c square
del two xi del x square this is again a wave equation in one dimension
p zero is the value of the pressure in equilibrium state is equal to minus c square rho zero
del xi del x where rho zero is the density of the gas in the equilibrium state
firstly we shall discuss about occurrence of wave equation in many problems in physics in
is to be determined subject to the condition del xi del x equals to zero at x equals to zero
and x equals to a so these are the boundary conditions for this particular problem
now, we are going to discuss about sound waves in space suppose the sound wave
in a gas has the velocity v which has components u, v, w at a point x y, z
and p rho are the pressure density respectively
s is the condensation of the gas and c square equals to dp d rho at equilibrium state
module one, for that discussion we need to go to the slide show so we are going now
now, we are going to start module two of chapter six this module is devoted to the solution
from here, we got the expression if you take, if you observe the expression for capital
u we have chosen w as one, so for that this terms becomes zero del w del x, so capital
are going to slide presentation the one dimensional wave equation is given by del two u del t
so, it is written here so, it is written in equation number fifteen now, we have to integrate
x plus y is equals to x bar plus y bar, so for that, so for this characteristics the normal, this
is the angle between the normal to the characteristic with the x axis, so for that the cos of nx
becomes one by root two, cos of ny becomes one by root two and subsequently the value
of ds is minus root two dx and this is equals to minus root two dy
so, substituting all these we get integration over ap del u del x cos nx minus del u del
y cos ny ds equals to minus integration a to p del u del x dx plus del u del y dy, so
cauchy problem of one dimensional wave equation and we obtains this solution using riemann’s
the derivation can be seen from the e-text of this module
we have already used the method of separation of variable to find solution of different
all we shall solve this one dimensional wave equation using canonical transformation from
differential equation now, we are going to use that method to find solution of one dimensional
wave equation in cartesian coordinate system, plane polar coordinate system and spherical
polar coordinate system
now, we are going to our slide show we have one dimensional wave equation and we are trying
to find the solution of that equation using separation of variables method for that purpose
we write the solution u as product of two function capital x and tau where x and tau
are functions of small x and small t respectively now, substituting the expression for u from
now, we separate the function capital x and capital tau in this way and to assume that
small k as our separation constant in the first case we assume our separation constant
as some positive constant so we assume k is equals to mu square where mu is a real number
so, substituting that we obtain two separate equations for capital x and tau and
it is easy to solve both the equation and the solutions are given here capital x is
c one cos hyperbolic mu x plus c two sin hyperbolic mu x and tau is also linear combination of
cos function and sin function, hyperbolic functions
in the second case we assume our separation constant as zero, then the equations for capital
x and tau becomes del two x del x square equals to zero del two tau del t square equals to
zero and the solution of this equations are capital x is c five x plus c six and tau is
equals to c seven t plus c eight, where c five, c six, c seven and c eight are constants
are xi equals to x plus ct and eta equals to x minus ct
so, the solution can be written as u is equals to these are product of capital x and capital
tau which is written in equation number nineteen now, in the last case we assume the separation
constant k as some negative number, so we assume k as minus mu square and the solution become
u equals to sum c nine cos mu x plus c ten sin mu x into c eleven cos c mu t plus
now, i am going to discuss the solution in plane polar coordinates the wave equation
in plane polar coordinate takes the form which is written in the equation number twenty one
now, in this equation we assume time periodic solution, so for that purpose we write the
solution in the form u is equal to capital r into e to the power i omega t
so, substituting this expression for u in the equation twenty one, we obtain the equation
for capital r as d two r dr square plus one by r dr dr plus omega square by c square r
functions of order zero and of first kind and second kind respectively
c one j zero omega r by c plus iy zero omega r by c plus c two into j zero omega
function, so capital r can be written as c one h zero one omega r by c plus c two h zero
two omega r by c
and they are defined in this way which is written here therefore, in terms of hankel’s
function the solution can be written as u is equals to c one h zero one plus c two h
coordinates system case where the equation wave equation can be written in the form which
is given in equation number twenty three
so for that purpose we are writing u as some function capital r into e to the power i omega
t, so if you substitute this in twenty three the r equation becomes this d two r dr square
plus two by r dr dr plus omega square by c square r equals to zero this is not bessel
so, for that purpose we give a transformation which is shown here capital r is equals to
omega r by c to the power minus half into capital f so, the equation in terms of capital
f becomes this so, this is bessel equation of order half, therefore its solution is the
of order half
now, in terms of capital r or the value of capital r can be written as capital r is one
the constant a and the constant b are define as a is equal to square root c by omega a
and the operator del del t is equivalent to del del xi minus del del eta
dash and b is equal to square root c by omega b dash
now, you can note that the value of j half can be written in terms of sin function as
j half equals to square root two by pi x sin x and j minus half x is square root two by
omega r by c plus b cos omega r by c
and the solution also can be written in complex form in this way, capital r equals to one
by r c one e to the power i omega r by c plus c two e to the power minus i omega r by c so,
this is the solution of wave equation in spherical polar coordinate system
of one dimensional wave equation we have chosen one dimensional wave equation because
therefore, in module two of chapter six, we obtain solution of one dimensional wave equation
using separation of variables method, it is to be motioned that the solutions obtain by
can be seen in our e-text thus, we end module two of chapter six
trying to transform the equation from x t to xi eta
it is easy to find solution of this equation the general solution of this equation is u
psi into k times x minus ct is also a solution of the one dimensional wave equation, where
it is easy to handle and for some physical situation it is sufficient to consider the
plus minus omega t is called the phase of the traveling wave and the term x plus minus
ct are known as characteristics of the one dimensional wave equation
in chapter four, we have seen that cauchy type initial value problem is over determined
to find solution of a laplace equation but in case of wave equation cauchy type initial
value problem gives an unique solution and that solution is called d’alembert’s solution
now, in our next slide we're going to discuss about the d’alembert’s solution of one
dimensional wave equation
suppose we have the cauchy type initial value problem which is written by equation four
and five, equation four is nothing but one dimensional wave equation and equation five
problem as one dimensional problem we shall solve one dimensional wave equation using
psi are arbitrary function
since phi and psi are arbitrary now we're using the initial condition, the first initial conditions
equals to phi plus psi, so in this equation we put t equals to zero so that gives phi
x plus psi x equals to eta x and the second initial condition, del u del t equals to nu
four different methods
to nu x and these equation can be solved to get the solution which is written in equation
number seven
so, solving that we get phi x minus psi x equals to one by c integration over zero to x nu
eta x minus one by two c integration zero to x nu xi d xi
firstly, we shall solve it using canonical transformation, in the second method, we shall
after simplification as u equals to half eta x plus ct plus eta x minus ct plus one by
to c integration x minus ct to x plus ct nu xi d xi the solution which is written in
equation number nine is known as d’alembert’s solution of the one dimensional wave equation
in chapter three, we have already discuss the riemann method or greens function method to
find solution of a partial differential equation there i mentioned that this method is very
important to find solution of a one dimensional wave equation now i am going to present how
now, in wave equation we first give a transformation y is equals to ct and the equation reduces
to the form del two u del x square equals to del two u del y square suppose we have
the condition u is equals to eta x, y and del u del n equals to nu x, y on c that means
find the d’alembert’s solution of wave equation, then we shall solve this equation
the value of the variable u and the normal derivative of u are prescribed on some curve c,
and let gamma is the projection of c on x y plane
suppose, we have to find the value of u at some point x bar y bar of the wave function
u at the point p, and the characteristics of the equation ten through the point p are
the figure is shown here, so we are interested to find the value of u at the point p having
coordinated x bar y bar and the two characteristics are pa and pb and the value of u are prescribed
in the curve c, the c is shown here
using the riemann-volterra method and lastly, we shall use the method of separation of variables
b, which you can see in this figure, this is the first line it intersects the curve
now, think about the operator l which is del two del x square minus del two del y square
so, here we have to find the solution of lu equals to zero and you can easily verify that
this operator capital l is self-adjoin now we calculate this double integral over sigma
and this can be again written in this form del del x of w del u del x minus u del w del
this is the double integral or the surface integral now, this surface integral is equals
to find the solution of one dimensional equation
now, the green’s function w must satisfy some conditions which are written here
the w must satisfy lw equals to zero and del w del n equals to zero on ap and bp,
first, we shall use canonical transformation to find the solution for derivation now we
now, i am going to start module three of chapter six in this module, i shall discuss about
and the velocity del u del t at time t is equal to zero is given by the function g
since, the deflection is a single valued periodic function of theta of period two pi
so, if we look at the solution, which is given in equation number five, since this is periodic
in theta, so value of these quantity will remain same, if we replace theta by two pi
plus theta so to get the same result, to make it periodic in theta, we should have lambda
is equals to some integer m therefore, we get the values of lambda as m, where m is
some integer
to one by c square tau d two tau dt square
again, if we look at the solution which is written here, in this solution, we know that
the bessel function of second kind which is denoted by y lambda is undefined at r equals
so here, we have taken c two equals to zero now, if we use the boundary condition u at
r equals to a is equal to zero, that gives the equation jm mu a equals to zero
so, first we separate the function of t from the function of x and y and to assume the
it is given that the value of u at time t is equal to zero is equal to f so, that condition
b mn sin m theta and these condition can be obtained from the general solution putting
t is equal to zero, that means from this solution
now, in this solution, if you apply the initial condition del u del t is equal to g at time
separation constant as minus mu square to obtain a periodic solution now, the equation
mn, b mn, c mn and d mn
and fourier series so, to obtain the values of a mn, we need to multiply the first
a for r and integrate over zero to two pi for theta and then using the orthogonality
property of bessel function and the cosine function we can obtain the expression for
in spherical polar coordinate system the wave equation in spherical polar coordinate
of variables method for that we are writing solution u as product of r theta and tau
so, if you substitute u these expressions expression in seven, we obtain the expression
which is written in the last line so, as usual, we first separate the function of t
that means tau, first and we have taken the expression to the right side and to get the
periodic solution, we assume the separation constant as a negative number minus mu square
where mu is a real constant
separate the function capital x and capital y in the last line one by x d two x dx square
at this equation, it is easy to find the solution of this equation, if we start from the tau equation,
the solution is combination of sin function and cosine function and solution
can be written here as tau is equal to some constant c five cos omega t plus c six sin
omega t, where omega is c into mu
to the dependent variable capital r, it is possible to reduce the equation to bessel
equation so, this is the necessary transformation so we use these transformation capital r equals
to small r to the power minus half into capital s now, the equation in terms of capital s
becomes which is shown here and these equation is known to us, this is famous bessel equation
plus mu square equals to minus one by y d two y dy square is equal to lambda square
of order
r can be written as capital r is equal to small r to the power minus half into sr and
not in the standard form but if we do the substitution cos theta equals to mu dash,
in terms of mu dash the theta equation can be written in the form one by mu dash square
into d two theta d mu dash square minus two mu dash d theta d mu plus n into n plus one
say where lambda square is the another separating constant
theta equals to zero and this is famous legendre equation and we know the solution of legendre
equation are
now, in terms of theta the solution becomes capital theta is equal to c three pn cos theta
plus c four qn cos theta and we have already got the solution for tau, which is written
in the last line
so, the required solution can be written in the form which is given in equation number
nine, which is u is equal to r to the power minus half sum over n, this is linear combination
of bessel function of first kind and second kind multiplied with the function of theta
capital theta plus tau so, this is our required solution
thus, in module three of chapter six, we have derived the solution of two dimensional wave equations
in cartesian coordinate system, we found the solution is double fourier series
case of spherical polar coordinate system, the solution is mixed, bessel and legendre series
now, we end this module
equals to mu square minus lambda square and q square equals to lambda square and the constant
solution of two dimensional wave equation in different coordinate systems those are
mu square is equals to p square plus q square
constants and they are determined from the supplied initial and boundary conditions
therefore, the solution of two dimensional wave equation in cartesian coordinate system
now, we shall take one example, where we need to solve two dimensional wave equation in
cartesian coordinate system together with some given initial and boundary conditions
cartesian coordinate system, plane polar coordinate system and spherical polar coordinate systems
for that purpose we consider a physical problem where we consider the vibration of a membrane,
which is stretched between the lines x equals to zero, x equals to a, y is equal to zero
and y is equal to b
and the initial condition is given by u at x equals to zero is equal to zero, u at x
equals to a is equal to zero, u at y is equal to zero is zero, and u at y is equal to b
so that is written here c one is equal to zero and if we use the condition u x zero
three equals to zero, so that is also written here c three equals to zero we have two more
for all the cases, we shall use the method of separation of variables to find the solution
initial conditions, which are u at x equals to a equals to zero, and u at y is equal to
b is equal to zero
be equals to m into pi, where m is some integer or in other words, we can say that p is equals
to c into square root of p square plus q square so, that equals to pi c into square root m
square by a square plus n square by b square
values of these constants can be obtained using the other conditions now, we consider
that the membrane starts from rest with initial position f x y, that means, u is equal to
f x, y at time t is equal to zero and the velocity that means del u del t at time t
the wave equation in cartesian coordinate system is written here del two u del t square equals to
so, from this expression, it is clear that it represent a double sin fourier series
now, to obtain the coefficient a mn, we need to multiply both the sides of this expression
or the required solution can be written in the
by b square
c square del two u del x square plus del two u del y square in separation of variables method
now, we are going to find solution of two dimensional wave equation in plane polar coordinate
given by equation number four here we are using the same strategy means we are using
the separation of variables method to find the solution, for that purpose we are writing
the solution u as product of capital r capital theta and tau
then, we substitute the solution to equation four to obtain the relation which is written here,
theta d two theta d theta square equals to one by c square tau d two tau dt square
so, first we're separating the function tau from the function of r and theta and to get the
periodic solution we are assuming the separation constant as a negative number, which is here
we write the solution u as product of capital x capital y and tau
is minus mu square, so the equations becomes which is written in the last line
now, we are separating the function of r and theta and we are assuming the separating constant
as lambda square so, assuming lambda square as our separation constant, we obtain the
plus mu square minus lambda square by r square capital r equals to zero and the theta equation
is given by d two theta d theta square plus lambda square theta equals to zero and the
equation for tau is d two tau dt square plus mu square c square tau equals to zero
and we substitute the solution to equation one to obtain the expression which is written
c three cos lambda theta plus c four sin lambda theta
similarly, we can obtain the solution for tau as tau is equal to the linear combination
c two, c three, c four, c five, c six are arbitrary constants and the values of these
constants can be obtained from supplied initial and boundary conditions therefore, the required
solution of the two dimensional wave equation in plane polar coordinate system is u is equal
now, we are going to discuss an example where we can use the solution of wave equation in
plane coordinate polar coordinate system together with some initial and boundary conditions
in the next line one by x del two x del x square plus one by y d two y dy square equals
﻿now, i am going to start module four of chapter six in this module,
the theta equation is not familiar to us, but if we do some substitution,
that means if we put cos theta equals to some variable mu and if we write the equation
in terms of mu that means if we change the independent variable from theta to mu,
we shall obtain legendre equation, rather we can say that we will get an associated
legendre equation so, it solution is the linear combination of associated legendre function
if you give a transformation to the dependent variable in such a way that capital r equals to
r to the power minus half into capital s, it can be shown that capital s will satisfy
bessel differential equation of order n plus half so, the general solution for
where j and y are bessel function of first kind and second kind and top order n plus half
can be represented by the equation given by equation number one
therefore, the solution capital r can be written as capital r equals to r to the power
minus half into s therefore, solution of wave equation in spherical polar coordinate system
can be written in the form, which you can see in this slide in the last section, we
have discussed about solution of homogeneous wave equation using separation of variables method
but, it is also necessary to find solution of inhomogeneous wave equation because these type
of equation arises in electromagnetic theory and other branches of mathematical physics
now, we shall use duhamel’s principle to find solution of inhomogeneous wave equation
in terms of the homogeneous wave equation now, we are going to our slide presentation
in this section, i shall discuss duhamel’s principle for wave equation here, i shall show
that how the solution of inhomogeneous wave equation is related to the general solution of
homogeneous wave equation consider the euclidean three dimensional space r three and a point x,
y, z belongs to r three suppose, v is function of x, y, z, t and lambda
lambda is some parameter which satisfies the partial differential equation
del two v del t square minus c square napla square v equals to zero
that means, v satisfies the homogeneous wave equation together with initial conditions v,
if you take the differentiation of u with respect to t, so this is differentiation under the sin
respectively now, substituting this solution to equation one,
lambda lambda t lambda, again differentiate del u del t with respect to t again
so, left hand side at del u delta t square, right hand side is again differentiation under the sin
of integration so, the first element is del v del t at the point lambda equals to t
x, y, z, t minus lambda lambda d lambda and the value of del v del t
therefore, the value of del v del t at x, y, z, zero, t is equals to capital f x, y,
the value of del two v del t square is c square napla square v
we can substitute the value of del two v del t square as c square napla plus square v,
the differential operator with respect to x, y and z so, we can take out this differential operator
minus lambda lambda d lambda so, that is nothing but u so, in the next line we can write it as f
x, y, z, t plus c square napla square u therefore, u satisfies the
wave equation inhomogeneous wave equation, which is written in equation number seven
and you can prove that value of u at x, y, z, zero is zero and del u del t at x, y, z
zero is also zero therefore, the solution of wave equation, not wave equation this is inhomogeneous
wave equation can be written in terms of the solution of the homogeneous wave equation,
d two y dy square plus one by z d two z dz square equals to one by c square tau
which is given by equation number six in this way, we can find the solution of
inhomogeneous wave equation that means, u in terms of the solution of the homogeneous
we have discussed about the solution of three dimensional wave equation,
we use separation of variables method to find solution of homogeneous wave equation
we have discussed three separate cases in cartesian coordinate system, the solution
is mixed fourier function in case of cylindrical coordinate system, we obtain
mixed bessel and fourier function, where as in case of spherical coordinate system,
we obtained the solution as mixture of bessel, legendre and fourier function
we have also derived the solution of inhomogeneous wave equation
d two tau dt square so, first of all, we are
using duhamel principle there we have shown how to write solution of inhomogeneous wave equation
separating the function of t from the function of x, y and z so, that's why we write the expression
in t tau in the right hand side now, to get a periodic solution, we assuming
the separation constant as a negative number so in this case, the value of the separation
we shall discuss about solution of three dimensional wave equation
constant is minus omega square by c square now, using this separating constant,
we again separate the function of z from the function of x and y and that is written in the
d two z dz square minus omega square by c square we are assuming here the separation
constant as n square in the last line, we are separating the function of x and function of y,
which is written here, one by capital x d two x dx square equals to minus one by y d
therefore, all the equations for capital x, capital y, capital z and tau
can be expressed in the form which can be seen in this slide
the module is divided into two section, in first section we shall find solution of
at the equation for capital y, its solution is also linear combination
of sin function and cosine function so, the solution for y can be written as capital y
is equals to c five cos rz plus c six sin rz and the solution for
tau can be written as tau equals to c seven cos omega t plus c eight sin omega t
and it is clear from the solution that it is periodic with respect to time
and its period is two pi by omega so, the solution of the
original equation or the three dimensional wave equation can be written as u is equal to capital x
into capital y into capital z into tau which is given here in equation number two,
where the constants p, q, r z, r omega are given by the equation
wave equation using separation of variables method and in the second section we shall use
q square equals to n square minus p square r square equals to omega square by c square minus
n square and p square plus q square plus r square equals to omega square by c square
now, we are trying to find the solution of wave equation in cylindrical coordinate system
the wave equation in cylindrical coordinate system can be expressed as it is given in equation
del u del r plus one by r square del two u del theta square plus del two u del z square
now, to apply the separation of variables method we write the solution u as product of capital r,
capital theta, capital z and tau and we substitute the solution to equation three
r square theta d two theta d theta square plus one by z d two z dz square equals to
duhamel’s principle to find solution of in homogeneous wave equation now, we are
one by c square tau d two tau dt square so first we're separating the time variable
and we are assuming the separation constant as minus omega square by c square to obtain
a periodic solution of the given equation now, using that separation constant, in the next line
separating constant minus n square again, we're separating the function of
going to the slide presentation for deriving the solution using separation of variables method
the equations for r theta z tau can be written in the form which you can see in this slide
so, if you observe the tau equation so it's very easy to find solution of this equation
so, its solution is a linear combination of sin function and cosine function so, this is periodic
with period two pi by omega so, the solution for tau is tau equals to some constant c seven cos
now, if you look at the theta equation, its solution is again a linear combination of sin
r dr dr plus n square minus m square by r square into capital r equals to zero and
i have already discussed the method of separation of variables to find solution of laplace equation,
this is famous bessel equation of order m so, its solution is a linear combination of
therefore, the solution of wave equation in cylindrical coordinate system is given by
u equals to capital r into capital theta into capital z into tau
which you can see in equation number four and in this solution, the constants
these constants can be obtained from the initial and boundary condition of the given problem
now, i am going to discuss the solution of wave equation in spherical polar coordinate system,
the wave equation in spherical polar coordinate system is given by equation number five
heat equation and also wave equation in one dimension and two dimension
as usual, we are assuming the solution u as product of four functions capital r, capital
theta, phi and tau where these are function of small r, small theta, small phi and t respectively
so, substituting this solution to the original equation phi, we obtain the relation which
you can see in the last line so, first of all we are separating
the solution is time periodic, so the separation constant is taken as a negative number
so, that separation constant for this problem is minus omega square by c square
so, using that separating constant
we then separate the function of phi from the function of r and theta
so, in the first line you can see that we are separating phi from the other two variables r and
now, i am going to apply this method to find solution in three dimensional cartesian coordinate system
theta and we are assuming the separation constant as m square now, using this separation constant
in the next line we are separating the function of r and function of theta and
the separation constant for this case is n into n plus one now, all the equations means,
the equation for capital r, capital theta, capital phi and tau are given by these four equations
so, if you observe these equations, so let us first start with the tau equation
so, from tau equation you can see that the solution is periodic in time
and if you look at the phi equation, a solution is also the linear combination of sin function
and cosine function so, capital phi is equals to c five cos m phi plus c six sin m phi
now, if we look the theta equation,
the wave equation in cartesian coordinate system
today i am going to start chapter seven this chapter is devoted to the solution of partial
one and this is valid for real p greater than minus one
to one divided by two pi i integration gamma minus i infinity to gamma plus i infinity
there is a pole of the function at the point p is equal to minus one so value of the integral
is is equal to residue at the pole p is equal to minus one and we can calculate the residue
its value becomes e to the power minus x
so applying inverse laplace transform, we are getting back our original function e to
as fx equals to one divided by two pi integration minus infinity to plus infinity f bar p e
and in the same module we shall define inverse integral transform in module two, we shall
transform and then again inverse fourier transform and we shall show that we can get we will
get the original function so for that, we take the function e to the power mod x the
fourier transform of this function is f bar equals to integration zero to infinity e to
power minus one minus ip x dx plus integration minus infinity to zero e to power one plus
ip into x dx the first integral gives one divided by one minus ip, and the value of
the second integral is one divided by one plus ip so after simplification, the expression
for f bar p becomes two divided by one plus p square
now the inverse formula or the inverse fourier transform of this f bar p is fx equals to
one by pi integration minus infinity to plus infinity e to the power ixp by one plus p square dp
show some application of laplace transform to find solution of a differential equation
so, if we evaluate that integral we will get its value as e to the power minus
x for x greater than zero and its value is equals to e to the power x for x less than
zero so combining these two results, we can say that fx equals to e to the power minus mod x
inverse formula for fourier sine and cosine transform are defined as- inverse fourier
fourier cosine transform is defined as fx equals to two by pi integration zero to infinity
f bar p cos xp dp
if fx equals to minus x then its sine transform is integration zero to infinity e to the power
minus x into sin px dx so after integration, we get its value is equal to p divided by
one plus p square if you take the cosine transform of the same function e to the power
in module three, we shall give application of fourier integral transform in module four,
minus x, we obtain integration zero to infinity e to the power minus x cos px dx is equals
to one divided by one plus p square
of the given function e to the power minus x now if we apply inverse sine function of
this function, then value of fx is equals to two by pi integration zero to infinity
can say that it is possible to get back the original function a for using the inverse
sine transformation
in the similar way, a it is also possible to find the original function if we apply
the inverse cosine transformation so for to establish that, now we are taking the transform
we shall give application of mellin transform and henkel transform and lastly in module
variable f bar p as one by one plus p square so this is nothing but cosine transformation
of the function e to the power minus x now, we are applying inverse cosine transformation
to this function so fx is equals to two by pi integration zero to infinity one by one
both sine transformation and cosine transformation, and then applying inverse of sine transformation
and inverse of cosine transformation, it is possible to get back the original function
now i am going to define inverse henkel transformation the inverse henkel transformation is defined
henkel transformation of this fx is given by f bar p is equals to integration zero to
five, we shall discuss the application of finite integral transform to find solution
now, if we apply inverse henkel transformation to one by p, we get fx equals to integration
zero to infinity one by p into p jn xp dx and after integration we are getting our original
function one by x
this is inverse mellin transformation it is defined as fx equals to one divided by
two pi i integration gamma minus i infinity gamma plus i infinity f bar p x to the power
minus p dp for x greater than zero fx, for this transformation we are using the function
e to the power minus x and the henk- mellin transformation of e to the power minus x is
f bar p equals to integration zero to infinity e to the power minus x x to the power x minus
p minus one dx this is the, the famous gamma function so its value is gamma p
of a partial differential equation
now, we are using inverse mellin transformation to get the value of fx and so value of fx
is one divided by two pi i integration gamma minus i infinity to gamma plus i infinity
gamma p x to the power minus p dp and here we are using the formula gamma p into gamma
one minus p equals to pi divided by sin pi p and using that formula, we can get back
now, i am showing some important results on integral transform so, these are the results
regarding laplace transform the first one you can see this is this gives the laplace
transform of the any nth order derivative of a function f so its value equals to p
to the power n f bar p minus p to the power n minus one f zero minus p to the power n
minus two f dash zero dot dot minus f n minus one zero, where f bar p denotes the laplace
so, first of all, i am going to start module one of this chapter for that we need to go
transform of the function fx
is linear so laplace transform of c one f one plus c two f two plus c n fn equals to
laplace transforms of f one, f two, fn respectively
the third result this is called the scaling property which shows that laplace transform of
function of alpha x equals to one by alpha f bar p by alpha and the third fourth one
this is the shifting property so laplace transform of e to the power minus lambda x
fx is equals to f bar lambda plus p and the next property which shows that laplace transform
of f x minus x dash into h x minus x dash is equals to e to the power minus p x dash
to the slide presentation we define integral transform of a function fx by the integral
into f bar p, where hx is the heavy side function
and the next result which is known as convolution theorem or convolution property which shows
that if f one p is the laplace transform of the function f one and f two p is the laplace
transform of the function f two, then f one into f two f one bar into f two bar is equal to
laplace transform of the function phi x where phi x is given by integration zero to
x f one x dash into f two x minus x dash dx dash or it may be written in this way zero
to x f one x minus x dash into f two x dash dx dash
and the last result it shows the laplace transform of an integral so if phi x is the is a function
integration zero to x fx dash dx dash, then laplace transform of phi x is equal to one
by p f bar p
and this is the table of some laplace transforms and all these results can be derived easily
and the similarly, we can show some properties of fourier transform so,
if f denotes the complex fourier transform of the function small f, then the fourier transform
of the nth derivative of the function f is given by minus ip to the power n f bar p,
where f bar p is the complex fourier transform of the function small fx
and the second result it shows the linear property of fourier transform and the third
power iap into f bar p and the fourth property gives the mth order derivative of f p is equals
limits of this integration may be finite or infinite the function k, which is function
differential equation using integral transform the study of integral transform has been started
of fourier transforms so, using the definition of fourier transform, we can establish these
results easily
thus, in module one of chapter seven, we have defined integral transform we have also defined
inverse integral transform we defined four different type of integral transforms those are laplace transform, fourier transform,
mellin transform and henkel transform we illustrate integral
transform taking some examples taking some functions we applied integral transform
then we applied inverse integral transform and we showed that it is possible to get back
the original function now, we end module one of chapter seven
finite, f bar p is termed as finite transform of the function fx
laplace transform of the function fx is defined as f bar p equals to integration zero to infinity
fx e to the power minus px dx so in laplace transformation, the value of a is finite,
that the laplace transform of the function fx exist if fx is continuous or piecewise
in nineteenth century when laplace fourier discovered laplace transform, fourier integral transform,
now i am going to define fourier integral transform, which is given by equation number
fx must satisfy dirichlet's condition in minus infinity to plus infinity it is to be mentioned
that dirichlet's condition means fx should satisfy the two conditions, one of them is
fx must have finite number of finite discontinuity within any finite interval within minus infinity
and the next and second condition to fx is fx must be absolutely integrable
within the interval minus infinity to plus infinity so if fx satisfies these two conditions, dirichlet's
etcetera the integral transform is very easy and effective method
in the similar way, we can define fourier sine or cosine transform the transformation
is given in equation number four the fourier sine transformation is given by integration
zero to infinity fx into sine px dx whereas fourier cosine transformation is given by
integration zero to infinity fx cos px dx
there is another popular transformation which is known as henkel transformation
jnpx is the bessel function of first kind and of order n where n is greater than minus half
number one, fr equals to order of r to the power minus k as r going to infinity
this method is used to find solution of differential equation and integral equation
subinterval of zero infinity
there is one another popular transformation which is known as mellin transformation where
finite interval in zero infinity
in the last section, we have defined four different types of integral transformations
they are laplace transform, fourier transform, henkel transform and mellin transform
in practice, we use integral transform to find solution of a differential equation
suppose we have a differential equation in which u is our dependent variable and t is one of
in this chapter our motivation is to find solution of differential equation particularly
the independent variable using integral transform, we transform one of the independent variable,
say the t variable, to another variable, let the transform variable is p and
the transform dependent variable is u bar
find the solution for u bar compared to the solution for u so after getting the equation
for u bar, we try to solve to find the value of u bar as function of p after getting u
bar as function of p, we need to apply inverse integral transform to find the value of u
as function of t that’s why it is important to know the inverse integral transform together
with integral transform
now, in this section, we are going to discuss about inverse integral transform in our slide
partial differential equation using integral transform we shall use most commonly used
presentation the inverse laplace transform is defined as fx equals to one divided by
two pi i integration over gamma minus i infinity to gamma plus i infinity f bar p into e to
the power px dp and fx equals to zero for x less than zero
so if you observe the integral, this is a contour integral and f bar p is a complex
valued function in general the value of the integral depends on the nature of the function
a single valued function, it may have finite number of poles or infinite number of poles
p is equal to gamma
integral transform namely laplace transform, fourier integral transform, mellin transform
generally, this line is closed by an arc of a circle which is represented by gamma in the figure
the line capital r in such a way that all the poles of the function f bar p lies on
the left of the line and it can be shown that the value of the integral over the circular
arc gamma as capital r tends to infinity is zero therefore, the value of the integral
which is written in equation number seven is equals to one divided by two pi i integration
gamma minus i infinity to gamma plus i infinity f bar p e to the power px dp it is evaluated
along the line capital l
different way so in either case, if it has it is a single valued function or it has some
and henkel transform to find solution of partial differential equation
branch point, the value of the integral is to be evaluated using cauchy's residue theorem,
which says that, the value of the integral one divided by two pi i integration fp e to
now, i am taking one example, where we shall show that we shall first use laplace transform
to transform the function fx to the function f bar p then we shall use inverse laplace
transform to get back the original function fx that means e to the power minus x so we
are taking, for example, here the function e to the power minus x the laplace transform
of this function by definition is f bar p equals to integration zero to infinity e to
the power minus x e to the power minus px dx so, this is integration zero to infinity
e to the power minus p plus one x dx so after integration, it gives one divided by p plus
the entire chapter is divided into five modules in module one, we shall define integral transform
we know that many problems of physical interest are described by ordinary differential equation
two equation, that gives the trivial solution, a equals to zero and b equals to zero therefore,
from the general solution which satisfies the given boundary condition, we
plus pi square c square by l square now, to get back the function u or the variable u
as function of t, we apply inverse laplace transform and we obtain the solution as u
in the previous problem, we have considered non-homogeneous initial condition and homogeneous
boundary condition in the present problem we are solving the same problem, wave equation,
but for this case the initial conditions are homogeneous whereas the boundary conditions
system is given by del u del t equals to kappa del two u del x square, where x greater than
are non-homogeneous so, the given equation is del two u del t square equals to c square
del two u del x square where x lies between zero and l, t greater than zero and the initial condition
u x, zero equals to zero and del u del t at t equals to zero is zero and the
boundary conditions are u zero, t equals to a sin omega t and u l, t equals to zero
so, if you take the laplace transform of the given equation, we obtain the same equation
which is written in the first line of this slide and if we put the values of u x, zero
to p square u bar where p is the transformed variable and u bar is the laplace transform
to a e to the power px by c plus b e to the power minus px by c
zero and t is greater than zero and we are also looking for the solution which is bounded
now, we need to find the values of a and b so to find the values of a and b, we need
to apply the boundary conditions so if we look back, the boundary condition, it is given
that u at the point x equals to zero, t equals to a sin omega t and u at x equals to l equals
to zero so if we apply laplace transform to this condition, the condition becomes,
conditions gave the equation a plus b equal to a omega by p square plus omega square and
a e to the power pl by c plus b e to the power minus pl by equals to zero and solving these
two equations, we can obtain the values of a and b which are written here
now, if we substitute the values of a and b in the general solution, that means in the
expression for u bar, we can get the functional value of u bar or the expression for u bar
which is written here a omega by p square plus omega square sin hyperbolic p into l
minus x by c divided by sin hyperbolic pl by c
and we know the formula for inverse laplace transform is u x, t equals to one divided
by two pi i integration gamma minus i infinity to gamma plus i infinity e to the power pt
into u bar xp dp this is a contour integration now to evaluate this contour integration,
we need to think about the function u bar and if you look at this function, the function
u bar has singularities at the point where p square plus omega square equals to zero
or in other words, it has singularities at the point p equals to plus minus i omega
equals to zero and it satisfies the boundary condition u zero t equals to some function
it also has singularities at the point where sine hyperbolic pl by c equals to zero
therefore, the function u bar has singularities at this point p is
equal to plus minus i omega and p is equal to plus minus i pi n c by l and all the singularities
are simple poles
therefore, u x, t can be written as sum of the residues at these simple poles so, we
have denoted the residues in this form where r zero plus, r zero minus are the residues
of e to the power pt u bar at p is equal i omega and p is equal to minus i omega respectively
that means e to the power pt into u bar at p equals to i pi nc by l and p equals to minus
of t which is equals to ft here
i pi nc by l respectively
this slide the first expression gives the residue of e to the power pt into u bar at the point p
is equal to i omega and the second expression it gives the residue of the function
e to the power pt into u bar at the point p is equal to minus i omega and after simplification,
the value of r zero plus plus r zero minus becomes this which you can see in the last
line of this slide
and the similarly, we can find the value of rn plus, this is the residue of the function
are calculated here using cauchy's residue theorem and this is the simplification which
its value is which is given here two a omega c l by omega square l squared minus n square
pi square by c square sin n pi x by l into sin n pi c t by l
therefore the required solution of the given differential equation is this u x, t equals
to this is the residue at p is equal to plus minus i omega that means this is r zero plus
plus r zero minus and this is the expression for rn plus plus rn minus
is homogeneous and boundary condition is non- homogeneous thus in module two of chapter
seven, we have learnt how to find solution of heat equation and wave equation using laplace
transformation the laplace transformation can be applied to find solution of other differential
equation which are linear not only that, these transformation can be applied to find
solution of integral equation and difference equation now, we end this module
where u bar is the transformed variable or dependent variable that means u is transformed
or partial differential equation together with initial or boundary values
to the variable u bar and the independent variable t is transformed to the variable p
therefore, now u bar is function of x and p only
to ft so if we apply laplace transform to this condition, that will give u bar zero
our problem becomes we have to solve an ordinary differential equation which is given by d
linear second order differential equation and we have to solve this equation together
with the initial condition u bar zero p equals to f bar p
these type of problems are called initial value problem or boundary value problem or mixed
a into e to the power minus square root p by kappa into x plus b into e to the power
we assume the value of the constant capital b as zero therefore, the solution becomes
we also have the boundary condition u bar zero p equals to f bar so if we use this
is e to the power minus square root p by kappa into x
initial-boundary value problem the method of laplace transformation is used to find solution of these type of
t now, to apply inverse transform to u bar, you can notice that u bar is product of two
functions so, to get back u as function of t, we need to apply convolution theorem so
to apply convolution theorem, we need to know the inverse transformation of f bar as well
the inverse transformation of g bar in this case, the inverse transformation of f bar
p is ft it is known to us
but we need to find inverse transformation of g bar p, where g bar is given by the exponential
function which is written here but, its not easy to find the inverse transformation of
these exponential function thats why we write g bar in this form p into one by p e to the
power minus square root p by kappa into x which is equals to p into h bar p, where
h bar p is one by p into e to the power minus square root p by kappa into x we write the
problems the method of laplace transformation is used to solve linear system of equations
equation in this form because the inverse transformation of h bar p can be obtained
easily which is shown here
the inverse transformation of h bar p which is denoted by ht is equals to laplace inverse
transformation of one by p e to the power minus square root p by kappa into x and its
value is complementary error function with argument x by two into square root kappa into
t becomes p into h bar p therefore, laplace inverse transformation of
the value h dash t which is written here
thus, in module two of chapter seven, we shall discuss about how to find solution of a differential
consequently, we can find the value of l inverse g bar p is equal to x by two t square root
pi kappa t e to the power minus x square four kappa t that equals to gt say now, if we
go back to the expression for u bar, the value of u bar is product of f bar into g bar where
inverse laplace transformation of f bar and g bar are known to us
now, we apply convolution theorem to find the value of u as u is equal to integration
tau, so if we substitute these values, we get the expression which is written here
so, this is our required solution
the physical problem is described by, which is written here there is a string which is stretched
equation using laplace transform in this module we shall solve one dimensional heat
the displacement of the string in the form u is equal to lambda sin pi x by l and we
also assume that the string is released from rest at time t is equal to zero
and we want to find the displacement of any point on the string at any time t
therefore, displacement will satisfy the wave equation which is written here del two u del t square
equals to c square del two u del x square, where zero less than x less than l and t is
greater than zero and we have also the initial condition u x, zero equals to lambda sin pi
x by l and del u del t at time t equals to zero is zero we have also the boundary conditions
u zero, t equals to u l, t equals to zero
now we take laplace transform of the given equation so, if you look at the equation,
equation and wave equation using laplace transformation method
we are taking laplace transform with respect to the variable t so, left hand side is equals
right hand side is equals to c square d two u bar del d x square
of del u del t is zero so if you substitute these values, the first equation can be written
this is not homogeneous so, the general solution of this problem is given by u bar equals to
complimentary function plus particular integral now the complimentary function of the homogeneous
now, we are going to our slide presentation first we shall solve one dimensional heat
plus pi square c square by l square
so, this is the general solution of the in-homogeneous ordinary differential equation, where a and
b are arbitrary constants now, we have to find the values of a and b using the supplied
condition now to find the values of a and b, we need to apply the boundary conditions
from the given boundary conditions, we apply laplace transform to get u bar zero, p equals
to zero and u bar l, p equals to zero if we use the first boundary condition, we obtain
a plus b equals to zero and if we use the second boundary condition we obtain a e to
the power p l by c plus b e to the power minus p l by c equals to zero now, if we solve these
equation using laplace transformation method the heat equation in cartesian co-ordinate
now, i am going to start module three of chapter seven this module deals with application
x tends to infinity, it follows that b is equal to zero because in this expression,
so, b cannot be a non-negative or nonzero number so, the only option is b is equal to zero
mod xi t divided by mod xi if you apply this condition this gives the value of capital
a as two u zero into sin mod xi t by mod xi
so, substituting this value of a, now our required solution becomes u bar equals to
two u zero sin mod xi t by mod xi, e to the power minus x square root mod xi by two kappa,
we have also the initial condition for u, u at t equal to zero is equal to f x and we
one minus i so, this is the solution for xi greater than zero similarly, for xi less
than zero, we can obtain the solution in the form u bar equals to two u zero sin mod xi
t divided by mod xi e to the power minus x square root mod xi by two kappa into one plus
i
is the formula of inverse fourier transform so, u x, t equals to one divided by two pi
integration minus infinity to plus infinity u bar e to the power minus i xi t into d xi
now, we break the interval into two parts, one is for negative values of xi and the other
is for positive values of xi
so, in these two intervals, we substitute the values of u bar and substituting these
xi, e to the power minus x square root mod xi by two kappa into e to the power i, x into
square root mod xi by two kappa minus xi t plus e to the power minus i x into square
root mod xi by two kappa minus xi t and these can be simplified to cosine function
so, in the next line, the term can be replaced by cosine function, which can be seen in this
in cartesian coordinate system, del two u del t square equals to c square del two u
del x square where x has infinite range and t is greater than zero and we have also the
initial condition u at t equals to zero is f x and del u del t at t equals to zero is
g x and we also have u and del u del x tends to zero as mod x tends to infinity
respect to x so, after taking fourier transform, the equation becomes d two u bar dt square
constants now, to obtain the values of these arbitrary constants, we need to apply the
now, if we apply these two condition in the general solution, we obtain a plus b equals
complex fourier transform of the given equation with respect to variable x so, we multiply
equals to half f bar plus i by xi c g bar
so, substituting the values of a and b in the general solution here, we obtain u bar
as half f bar into e to the power i xi ct plus e to the power minus i xi ct minus i
we need to find the value of u, as function of x and t so, to obtain u, this is a time
to take the inverse fourier transform of u bar thus, we take inverse fourier transform
of u bar so, u is equal to one by two pi minus infinity to plus infinity u bar xi t
e to the power minus xi x d xi
the laplace equation with e to the power i xi x and then integrate over x from minus
know the expression for fx, this is the inverse fourier transform of f bar xi
so, f x equals to one by two pi integration minus infinity to plus infinity f bar xi e
to the power minus i xi x dxi so in this expression, if you take the argument of f
as x minus ct, so, value of f x minus ct is equals to one by two pi minus infinity to
plus infinity f bar e to the power minus xi into x minus ct so, x will be replaced by
x minus ct in this expression similarly, the value of f x plus ct can be obtained from
infinity to plus infinity
the expression of fx by replacing x by x plus ct
fourier transform of g bar so, g eta is equals to one by two pi minus infinity to plus infinity
and this is the expression for g eta so, this equals to one by two pi minus infinity
by two pi now we interchange the order of integration so, it's minus infinity to plus
and we can find the value of this integral and value of this integral becomes here, which
the first term gives minus xi square u bar xi, y and the second term is plus integration
is written here, e to the power minus i xi into x minus ct minus e to the power minus
thus, it is possible to find the d'alembert solution of wave equation using fourier transform method
thus, in module three of chapter seven, we have learned how to find solution of laplace
equation, heat equation and wave equation using complex fourier transformation
there is also sine fourier transformation and cosine fourier transformation, which can be applied
minus infinity to plus infinity d to u d y square e to the bar, i xi x, dx equals to
applied to find solution of integral equation it has application in statistics also
this method is very useful to find frequency of a signal in electrical engineering
now, we end this module
of fourier transform to partial differential equation in this regard, i want to mention
which is given by the integration, in this integral if we interchange the differential
and integral operator, then it gives d to d y square of integration minus infinity to
plus infinity u into e to the power i xi x, dx so, that is nothing but u bar
so, the second term in the expression is d to u bar d y square and the first term is minus xi
square u bar equals to zero
now, this is the resultant equation so, this is an ordinary
power xi into y plus b into e to the power minus xi into y, where a and b are arbitrary
the power xi y, for xi less than zero thus, for any xi we can write the solution in the
form u bar is equal to c into e to the power minus mod xi into y
to the solution, u bar equals to c to the power minus mod xi y, this gives, the value
required solution u bar, which is function of xi and y, is equal to f bar xi into e to
the power minus mod xi into y
mellin transformation, hankel transformation can be defined in terms of complex fourier transformation
for u bar we need to apply inverse fourier transform to find u as function of x and y
u bar so, the formula is written here, u is equal to one by two pi integration minus
and we have also substituted the value of f bar xi, which is written here minus infinity
in the next line, this is equals to one by two pi minus infinity to plus infinity f eta, d eta
x minus mod xi into y, d xi
therefore, it is relevant to discuss about the application of fourier transform to partial differential equation
and the value of the second integral is one divided by eta minus x whole square
now, we shall consider heat conduction equation and we shall apply complex fourier transform
to find solution of this equation so, the given equation is the heat equation, one dimensional
heat equation in cartesian coordinate system, which is given by equation one, del u del
t equals to kappa del two u del x square where x lies between zero to infinity
and this equation is satisfied with the given condition this is the boundary condition u at x equals
to zero t cause to u zero for mod t less than capital t and equals to zero for mod t greater
than capital t and we also have the solution is bounded
in this module, we shall solve the laplace equation, heat equation
that means, u tends to zero as x going to infinity and mod t going to infinity thus,
we have to solve the conduction equation together with the condition which are given by two
since t has range from minus infinity to plus infinity, we are taking fourier transform with respect
to t so, for that reason, we are multiplying the equation by, e to the power i xi t and
then integrate over minus infinity to plus infinity the first term, if we look at the
left-hand side of this expression, we're applying in the next line we are applying the integration
by <?> first<?> so, for that we are assuming e to the power i xi t as our first function
so, according to that rule first function into integration of second function that is
u over minus infinity to plus infinity minus integration of derivative of first function
and wave equation using fourier transformation method now, we are going to slide show
so, that gives, e to the power i xi t into i xi and integration of second function that
is u dt is equal to the right-hand side here, we again interchange the operator integration
if you look back the condition three, u tends to zero as x tends to infinity and mod t tends
to infinity so, if we apply that, we get the term in the square bracket is zero
so, this term is zero and the second term is minus i xi into this is nothing but fourier transform
of u with respect to t for this problem, we are denoting that by u bar so, left hand
in this form also d two u bar dx square plus i xi dy by kappa u bar equals to zero
first, we shall start with laplace equation, the laplace equation in cartesian coordinate system
now, this is a second order ordinary differential equation in x and the solution of this equation
this condition, condition two, this is the boundary condition
so, if we apply fourier transform to that, it gives u bar zero, xi is equal to integration
the value of u is u zero within the interval minus t two plus t so, outside
that interval the value of the integral becomes zero so, the limits of the integration become minus
t to plus t
is given by del two u del x square plus del two u del y square equals to zero here we have
so, after integration we get its value is equals to two u zero sin xi t divided by xi,
is applicable for both xi greater than zero and xi less than zero now, if we look at
condition if we apply fourier transform, we obtain u bar x, xi goes to zero as x goes to infinity
root mod xi by two kappa into one minus i plus b e to the power x into square root mod
sin by two kappa into one minus i now, using the condition u bar x xi tends to zero as
considered infinite range for x and y is greater equals to zero
welcome participants
is calculated separately for each financial year ,
with the rules that even if it is broken year it will end on thirty-one st march
of that particular year, and accordingly the previous year
and assessment year will be calculated
so thus one particular year has nothing to do with the second year as far as the
total calculations are concerned
it is standalone calculations will be there for each year
so thus income tax is an annual tax the tax rate,
which would be applicable, actually relates to the assessment year tax rate
suppose i'm earning the income my previous year is two thousand and eighteen - nineteen
today, let us discuss the basis of charge
, while i calculate the income tax on my income
of the previous year two thousand and eighteen - nineteen i will refer to be tax rates
which are proposed or which are available
for the year or applicable for the year two thousand and nineteen - twenty assessment year
so the tax rate of assessment year is applicable
next, the rates are fixed by the finance act
what is the finance act every year nowadays on february one
that is the first day of february, the union finance minister
presents the union budget the budget
is accompanied by a finance bill
as provided under section four of the income tax act
, when the finance bill is debated in the parliament,
and it is passed by the parliament
it becomes a finance act it is a common feature
that every year the union finance minister presents the tax rates
in the finance bill itself , you get the tax rates for
each assessment year as suggested by the finance act of that particular year
tax is charged on person, we have already defined
that who are the person as we have defined in includes an individual,
a farm, a company, an hof,
an association of persons or body of individual, a local authority
this is the premise on which the income tax act is bill
or any artificial juridical person
so income tax is payable by the person it is a tax on total income
<petso</pet>, there is no term called taxable income or something like that
the income tax that defines total income how it is calculated
in my previous discussion, we have already seen what is the total income
may i repeat, total income is calculated by deducting the deductions
available under section eighty c to eighty u
from the gross total income what is gross total income
gross total income is the aggregate of all five heads of income
, just to explain again, when all five heads of income are aggregated
section four talks on the basic infrastructure, basic premise
we get the gross total income from the gross total income
we deduct the deductions available under section eighty c to eighty u,
and then we get the total income on this total income,
income tax is chargeable, and the income tax rate is fixed by the finance act
and the tax rates that are applicable for that particular assessment year
provisions as on april one of the assessment year are applicable
that's why the union budget
accompanies the finance bill and in the finance act
the changes in the income tax rate have some provisions are mentioned
and accordingly the rules for assessment year are applicable
on which the entire income tax law is made
to that particular previous year
, just to summarize again, how to compute the total income
we first calculate the income from salaries,
income from house property, profits and gains of business and profession,
capital gains and income from other sources
if there is any set up for carry foreward classes,
that is also adjusted and ultimately we get the gross total income
from the gross total income, we make the deductions
which are available under section eighty c to eighty u
and we get the total income which is liable to income tax </p>
let us see the features as referred by section four of the income tax act
, how the tax liability is computed
the total income is already calculated, will calculate the tax on total income
by charging the applicable rates
which are there for the relevant assessment year,
will deduct the rebate under section eighty-seven a
we get income tax after rebate under section eighty-seven a
if there is any surcharge, will add the surcharge, surcharge is applicable
in specified cases we get the tax and surcharge
there is an education cess which is applicable
and also some rebates are given under section eighty-six eighty-nine ninety ninety a and ninety-one
number one, it is an annual tax that is every year it is calculated on annual basis
all these rebates are deducted, then we get the net tax
from that amount of tax
as you know, we'll be discussing something about the advanced tax
normally the sse has already paid some amount of self assessment tax
there will be some amount of tax which might have been
deducted at source or collected at source
and there are some taxes which are already paid in advance
advance payment of taxes also stipulated by the income tax act
when these three are deducted from
the tax which you have already calculated, we get the net tax liability
we have already discussed the previous year assessment year
the net tax liability is to be payable to the government
if we pay in advance or in excess,
the income tax department will refund it to the assessee
and if it is being paid less, the excess amount
needs to be paid to the income tax authorities
thank you
, it is an yearly feature , income tax
welcome participants, today we will discuss
are subject to pay income tax,
because section two subsection thirty-one is a broad one
which involves or which takes into its purview, all kinds of entities
next important definition, or the term
which i have been using now is assessee ,
who is an assessee? section two sub section seven of
the income tax act defines a person
by whomany tax or any other sum of money is payable under the act
we have different kinds of assesse's
the first category of assesse's just now, i have told that a person by whom
while discussing various provisions of income tax laws
any tax or any sum of money is payable under the act
second category of assessee includes any person against whom any proceedings is going on
under the any court of law, that person may not be liable to pay income tax,
but income tax related proceedings
is or are going on in any court of law,
then also that person will be regarded as assessee
third category is known as representative assessee
that is, these persons are liable for somebody else income,
like the legal representative of a diseased guardian of a minor
these are the persons who are liable to pay income tax
previous year is the year in which
on behalf of some other persons, so they are known as a representative assessee
the fourth category is known as assessee in default
these are the persons who need not
pay income tax as per their individual capacity is concerned,
but because they are given certain duties
if they failed to comply with the duty or perform the duty,
if the default is doing the duty, they will become the assessee
under the income tax act suppose, a particular ddo
or finance officer or an accountant is given the duty to deduct tax
from salaries of employees every month
the assessee earns his or her income
, if the person who is given that particular esponsibility
is deducting income tax from the salary of his or their employees
regularly as per income tax law and deposits that particular money
into the government treasury, then he or she is performing
his or her duty perfectly , what happens if
that particular person has not deducted income tax, while he or she paid
the salary to the employees of the organization or having deducted the amount
they have not deposited the money to the government exchequer
in that case, they are in default of their respective duties
the income tax department will not run after
assessment year is the year in which income tax department
the hundreds of employees who work in that organization
they will make that particular accountant
or the ddo as a responsible for the income tax
then that particular accountant or that particular officer will become assessee
and technically we call them as assessee in default
thus, we get the four categories of assesse's
the first category is the person by whom
any tax or any other sum of money is payable under the act
second category is that against the such kind of persons,
some proceedings are going on in the court of law
assess or evaluates the tax to be paid by the taxpayer
third is that the representative assesses that these persons are liable
to pay tax on behalf of some other person
and fourthly, assessee in default that these persons are actually not assessee's
but they will become assessee if they default in performing their respective duties
next important definition is income
which is a very, very important one as far as the income tax is concerned,
because income tax is charged on the income of a person
section two subsection twenty-four defines the term income
and this definition is inclusive and not exclusive
some features of this income are there must be some definite and regular source
for example, the current year two thousand and eighteen - nineteen is the previous year
there are different forms of income,
the income tax act recognises the income,
either receipt or accrual receipt whichever is earlier
there is an interesting concept that legal versus illegal income
income tax act does not bother
about whether the income is legal or illegal
an illegal income, illegal income is also subject to income tax
the regarding the legality or illegality,
other acts are there where that particular persons will be prosecuted,
but income tax is charged on the illegal income also
that a person earns his or her income during this particular year
in case of disputed title, again, the income tax is not bothered
that who is the legal owner of that particular title
income tax will be charged on the person who is recipient of the income at the moment
income tax set also takes into consideration relief
or reimbursement of expenses that they are not regarded as income
so the income tax under the definition
or under section two sub section twenty-four takes into consideration various suspects
and there are many litigations, court cases
heard these by the honorable courts and accordingly the definition
has become inclusive one , let us see that
the income tax department will not disturb the person
there are certain heads of income on which income tax is chargeable
income tax act recognizes five heads of income,
a person may earn his or her income from various sources,
but any income must come under any of the five heads
these heads, the number one first one includes income from salaries,
the persons who are in employment, get salaries
, income tax that makes a separate
provisions for income from salaries
second head of income is income from house property, those people who own houses
or house properties and earned their income by way of gains from these properties
during the current year to pay or to charge income tax in this particular year
it will fall under the second head of income, income from house properties
third one is the broad one with income from business or profession
that is the various sections are there for computation of income for
business or profession next trade is capital gains,
that is a person may earn his or an income by selling capital assets
or by selling shares, debentures etc
, any kind of gains or losses
which occur for such transactions,
they will come under computation of income tax
under the head capital gains and lastly income from other sources
but they will evaluate and assess the tax
various definitions as given under the income tax act one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one
a person can earn income by way of interest on deposits put in different banks
dividend from shares, lotteries, crossword puzzles, etc
, the last head is a broad one, which talks about
income from other sources , these are the five heads of income
on which income tax is charged
, number one, it is income from salaries
number two, it is income from house property
number three, it is business or profession number four, it's capital gains
and number five other sources
, there is a concept called total income
once this particular year is over for example, the year
the total income of an assessee
is the gross total income as reduced by the amount
deductible under sections eighty c to eighty u
when we add up all these five heads, that is salaries
house property, business profession, capital gains, other sources,
when we add up with a submission is known as gross total income
from this gross total income, there are various deductions
as provided under the income tax act
mostly under section eighty c to eighty u
when these deductions are deducted
financial year two thousand and eighteen - nineteen it starts from first april two thousand and eighteen
from gross total income, we get the total income
and this is the total income on which income tax is chargeable
in our next discussion, we'll be discussing
how to calculate tax on various heads of income
thank you
and ends on thirty-one st march two thousand and nineteen a person earns his or her income
during this particular year, we can say this is the previous year
the next year which starts from first of april two thousand and nineteen
and ends with thirty-one st march two thousand and twenty in this year,
the income tax department will evaluate, will calculate
the tax to be paid by the taxpayer
on the income earned by him or her during two thousand and eighteen - nineteen
we can say that assessment year follows the previous year
these definitions are very much necessary
to again repeat previous year is the year
in which the person earns his or her income
and the assessment year is the year in which the income tax department evaluates,
calculates the tax to be paid by the taxpayer on the income
earned during the previous year normally, the previous year is
the financial year that the year starts from first of april and ends on thirty-one st march
but in case of a broken year, like
a business has started on fifteen th of august in that case,
the previous year will be fifteen th of august two thousand and eighteen and will end on thirty-one st march two thousand and nineteen
there was a rationalization in income tax laws
to understand the income tax laws
and now the all previous year must end on thirty-one st march of each year
suppose a business is started on thirty-one st march itself
then, for that particular year, the previous year will be
only for one day, that is thirty-one st march two thousand and eighteen to thirty-one st march two thousand and eighteen
and from the next year it will follow the complete financial year
this is the assessment year and previous year
so, normally as i told you, that income tax department does not
disturb the taxpayer during the previous year, they will assess
evaluate the tax only once the previous year end
, income is earned in year one, assessed to tax only
and when we will proceed in this particular course further
after completion of year one, that is in the next year, year two,
the year one is known as the previous year, and year two is known as
the assessment year this is the general rule
but there are exceptions to this general rule
i can cite five cases, five examples where
the assessment year is same as the previous year
that is the income tax department will not wait to
get the year one end and then calculate they will calculate
and demand the tax from the taxpayer in the very year in which the income is earned
case number one, we refer to section one hundred and seventy-two
, make yourself clear about the concepts, which we will be
shipping business income of non residents ship owners
who do not have any representive in india
in that case, the income tax will be charged
in the very year in which the income tax is earned
if the income tax department has the knowledge
that some persons are leaving india for good
with no intention to come back to india,
in that case, the previous year and assessment year will be the same
assessment of association of persons
body of individual or any artificial juridical person
discussing now to begin with, let me start with the concept called
which is formed or established only for a limited period
then also the previous year and assessment year will be the same one
in case of persons who are likely to transfer their asset to avoid tax
they are also liable to pay income tax on the very year of income
and lastly, in case of discontinued business
the previous year and assessment year will be the same
except is these five situations the normally the income earned by
the assessee in year one is assessed to tax or subject to tax in year two
this is the definition of assessment year and previous year
, in my discussion, just now, i was using the word called persons
assessment year and previous year
, income tax act has defined the word persons in detail
the income tax act says that income tax is payable by a person
and the question is who is a person?
section two subsection thirty-one of the income tax act defines a person
it includes an individual which normally we are here
a hindu undivided family huf, huf is a special entity created by hindu law
where the head of the family is known as karta
and the other members are copper sinners
, hindu undivided family is an entity
of under the income tax act so income tax file can be maintained
, what is the difference between these two terms?
in the name of hindu undivided family
thirdly a company, a company is registered under the companies act two thousand and thirteen
a firm that is a partnership firm whether it is a partnership firm
or a limited liability partnership
next, an association of persons or body of individual
then a local authority like municipality, board or corporation
and lastly,every artificial juridical person not falling
in any of the groups which i have just now mentioned
this is so broad that the deity also falls
under this particular definition , you can say that all kinds of entity
these terms we'll be using colloquially and very frequently
for future to take corrective actions
fourthly, tax planning helps in minimizing tax liability
in short term as well as in the long term
tax management helps in avoiding
payment of interest, penalties, prosecution etc
we can say that tax planning is optional
tax management is essential for every tax paying entity
in this week, we summarize that we have learned
the various nitty gritties of income tax as well as
the ways for minimizing the tax liability legally
to various tax laws and procedures
to summarize, we can say that the ways of tax evasion
should not be adopted tax avoidance, although not illegal
she's also not desirable, while
a person should go for the techniques and tools for tax planning,
as well as any taxpayer or any good citizen should go for tax management
thank you very much
we'll meet you in the next week with a new chapter
sri arun jaitley the union finance minister,
while presenting the union budget two thousand and eighteen - nineteen
lamented that india is a tax non compliant society
that majority of the indians who can afford to pay tax,
but they do not pay income tax a statistics was published in two thousand and fifteen - sixteen figures
that only three seven crore individuals filed income tax
out of these only seventy-six lakhs showed income above five lakhs
and out of this seventy-six lakhs the irony is that
fifty-six lakhs are salaried class that means,
welcome to the course direct tax laws and practice
people who can afford to pay income taxgiven a chance
they are willing to remain outside the tax net
, there is a normal tendency to reduce the payment of tax liabilities
the tax liabilities can be reduced by various ways
i can discuss four ways in details number one is the tax evasion
number two is the tax avoidance number three is tax planning
and fourthly, i will highlight various ways for tax management
regarding the tax evasion tax evasion is the way to reduce tax liability
but one should remember this is illegal
and whenever the person is caught, he will be punished under civil
thank you for enrolling into the program
and criminal procedures so this tax evasion is not
at all desirable, and no one should adopt this particular means
secondly is the tax avoidance tax avoidance is per se, not
illegal, but not desirable also there are various ways
where a person can legally avoid the payment of tax
but it doesn't help the country in their growth or in their development
as far as possible, the tax avoidance routes
should not also be adopted by taxpayers
third one, which is the tax planning, which is legal, and which is desirable
also it's a win win situation the income tax act
we will discuss various nitty gritties of
make ample provisions for the taxpayer to reduce their tax liabilities
one of the common example is that eighty section eighty c
whereby a taxpayer can save money into particular desired avenues
and if the money is saved in those avenues,
then the taxpayer can save a substantial amount of income tax
, the money where it is being saved
this money is also used by the government
for various development purposes and capital formation purposes
, tax planning is a win win situation
whereby the taxpayer saves a substantial amount of tax
direct tax laws and practice in this particular course
as well as he contributes for the development and growth of the country
in the entire course, we'll be discussing various ways
for tax planning, and we will give tips whereby
a taxpayer can save their income tax by resorting to various avenues as
specified in tax planning fourth one is tax management
tax management is actually compliance to tax laws
it relates to maintenance of accounts, audit
that is the timely audit of accounts, the payment of tax, filing of returns, etc
in this particular course, will also highlight
various aspects of tax management
the basic objective as has been told
whereby a good citizen knows that how to comply with the tax laws and procedures
and goes for the better tax management
thus, we have learned the difference between tax evasion,
tax avoidance and tax planning ,
that while tax evasion is undesirable
and not at all expected from a good citizen
tax evasion can be resorted to by overstating the expenditure
understating the income, not disclosing the income earned by the assessee
, these are all risky ventures
a good citizen should not adopt these practices,
is that to familiarize these participants with the various tax laws
because it will amount to excessive amount of penalties
and the chance of prosecution
second one is tax avoidance just to summarize,
that it is the way by taking various loopholes in the act or various
avenues in the act whereby a person avoids the payment of tax
which is not illegal, whereas i repeat,
this is not so much desirable also the most desirable is the tax planning,
like selecting an appropriate business plan,
investing in desired projects, etc whereby the taxpayer
helps the country to grow at the same time reduces his or her own tax liabilities
and our main purpose is to make the
and there are various consultants who will give
advice on the tax avoidance rules or tax planning rules
tax planning and tax management is what all wants now a days,
like at the one hand, no one wants to pay more tax
at the same time none wants to evade tax also,
as the implications are very strict
that's why people should adopt for tax planning and tax management,
as both are the best options to lower the tax burden
without affecting the spirit of law there is difference between
tax planning and tax management while the objective of the tax planning
students understand the nitty gritties of tax laws
is to minimize the tax liability
the objective of tax management
is to comply with the provisions of
income tax lawand its rules tax planning includes tax management,
while tax management deals with filing of return on time,
getting the accounts audited, deducting the tax at source,
paying the tax on time, etc tax planning relates to future
but tax management relates to past, present as well as future
past, it includes assessment, proceedings, appeals, revisions, etc
while present it includes filing of return, payment of advance tax etc
as well as to make them compliant
direct_tax_439
this week we'll be learning income from other sources
this head is a broad one and encompasses
any income which cannot be taken
in any of the previous sets of income
that is, it is neither income from salary;
it is neither income from house property
neither capital gains or profits
and gains of business or profession section fifty-six of the income tax act
deals with the basis of charge and it includes quite a large number of income
it includes dividend that is dividend earned by the assessee
but remember, dividend from indian companies are not chargeable to tax
under section ten because the company itself pays the dividend
the basis of charge also says that
at the income from other sources include winning from lotteries,
employees contribution towards staff welfare scheme,
interest on securities, rental income of machinery,
plant or furniture, rental income of letting out of plant,
machinery or furniture some received under keyman insurance policy
and also gift if it exceeds rupees fifty thousand in the previous year
, all these are added under the head income from other sources
welcome learners in this week
there are certain deductions which are available under section fifty-seven
and these deductions include commissions or remuneration payable
for realizing the dividend or interest,
deduction in respect of employees contribution towards
staff welfare scheme, repairs, depreciation
in case of letting out of plant machinery etc
and also in case of family pension
a standard deduction is given that is thirty-three three percent of the pension
or rupees fifteen thousand whichever is less
, besides this section fifty-seven also allows any other expenses,
we'll be learning the last head of income,
if these are incurred for earning that particular income,
but as it it cannot give a blanket exemption like this
, there are four conditions which need to be satisfied
number one, such expenses must be spened exclusively
for the purpose of earning that particular income
it must not be in the nature of capital expenditure
it must not be in the nature of personal expenses of the assessee
and it must be paid in the relevant previous year
not prior or nor subsequent
, remember section fifty-eight also says that there are certain amounts
that is income from other sources if you remember,
which are not deductible under this section,
like any expenses which are of personal nature,
these are not allowed to be exempted
, this is a summary of our discussion of
income from other sources
there are five heads of income
we have seen income from salaries
we have seen income from house property,
profits and gains of business and profession
and also last week about the capital gains
welcome participants today we will discuss about the background
by sir james wilson in order to meet the losses sustained by
the british government on account of sepoy mutiny, and from since then,
it has become a common feature in india
we get the act in one thousand, eight hundred and sixty which includes the income tax as a formal system
and the most comprehensive income tax law was the income tax act one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-two
income tax became a primary source of revenue
for the central government since one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-two
then, india got independence in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-seven professor nicholas kaldor,
an economist was invited to india to study
the taxation system of the country
of income tax in india and the history of<>lp income tax
based on the recommendations of professor kaldor
the wealth tax act one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven the expenditure tax act one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven
and the gift tax act one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-eight were introduced
actually professor kaldor advocated for expenditure tax rather than income tax
but income tax one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one came into existence with effect from
first of april one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-two based on the recommendations
of the law commission, and the inquiry committee
the income tax act has become a very interesting feature
in the country's economy presently,
the majority we try to get majority indians under the tax net
income tax in india we can trace back to the ages of ancient literature
there is a permanent account number given to most of the citizens of the country
which is a ten digit alphanumerical number,
which was launched in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four it acts as a unique identifier
and enables the income tax department to link all transactions
like tax payment, tds that is tax deducted at source, tcs,
tax collected at source, income tax return, high value transaction etc
to individual taxpayers and we can see the day
when pan will be closely interlinked with aadhar
so that all transactions can be linked to income tax
the income tax department in india
the manusmrti presents itself as a discourse given by manu
is governed by the central government
the administration of income tax in india
is controlled by the apex body central board of direct tax
under it, we have a director general of income tax or chief commissioners of income tax
then we have commissioners of income tax
then commissioners of income tax appeals,
additional director of income tax, aditional commissioner of taxes
we have joint director and that is the joint commissioner of taxes
we have deputy director or deputy commissioner of taxes, assistant director,
income tax officers, and ultimately we have got inspector of income tax
and we can get a reference of income tax in manusmriti
the income tax act one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one makes ample provision
for the aggrieved citizens that is a aggrieved taxpayer for making
different kinds of appeals that is, if a taxpayer
is not satisfied with the activities or the decision of any income tax authority,
there is a system for appeal
first, authority of appeal is the commissioner of income tax appeals
if he is not, or she is not satisfied with that decision,
she or he can go to income tax appellate tribunal
then ultimately we have got high court and the honourable supreme court is there
, there are different layers of making the appeal
kautilya's arthashastra is an ancient indian treatise
indian income tax follows a very equitable rule
there are different kinds of taxes and system all over the world
this tax can be either proportional that the income tax amount
will depend directly proportional to the income of an assessee or a person
on the other hand, it can be regressive,
that is, as you earn more, you have to pay less or third one is progressing
that as one earns more, they are to pay more amount of income tax
indian income tax act one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one follows the progressive rate of taxation
that is, a person with lesser income has to pay less tax
while a person with higher income has to pay more amount of income tax
on statecraft, economic policy and military strategy
currently we have got an exemption limit
of rupees two hundred and fifty thousand that is up to rupees two hundred and fifty thousand
a person need not pay any amount of income tax
the budget of two thousand and nineteen - twenty has made a tax rebate,
full tax rebate to the people who are earning up to rupees five lakhs
but otherwise, the normal rates are gradually increases to
five percent that is ten %, twenty percent and thirty percent that means,
as the person earns more income, the tax rate also increases
income tax act one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one makes ample provision for tax incentives
and tax penalties we can say that income tax act one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one
kautilya in his book, arthashastra, has referred
as a balanced one, the tax incentives are ample
a taxpayer if he or she follows the rules given in the income tax act
the provisions in the income tax act, the sections which are there,
whichencourages a taxpayer to invest in particular avenues
to make certain expenditures, which helps in national building
then various kinds of tax incentives are there
at the same time for those tax evaders
who evade payment of tax or who are non compliant to the tax laws
it makes immense provisions for tax penalty
thus, the income tax is a comprehensive tax law in india
the text to be collected by the king from the subjects
it is a challenging feature, that majority of the indians
have not come into the tax net till now, but gradually with the
inception of various digital policies, as taken by the government of india
more and more people are coming into the tax net
in our next discussions, we'll be learning
other basic concepts of income tax act
thank you
in modern india, the income tax was first introduced in one thousand, eight hundred and sixty
as i told you about the aggregation of agriculture income
then it will attract the aggregation clause of agricultural income
after agricultural income, let's see that what are the other incomes
which are exempted from income tax
number two is the amount received by a member
from the income of an huf,
because huf itself is a person and the tax paying entity
, when the huf pays the tax,
that portion of income which a member receives from huf,
he or she did not pay income tax on that income
same as the way of a partnership firm
with non agricultural income, the rule says that
as the partnership firm itself pays the tax
,the share of the profit when it goes to a particular partner,
he or she did not pay income tax on that share of profit
interest on notified securities and bonds issued to non residents
interest on savings certificates to non residents
remuneration received by individuals, who are not citizens of india
these are all exempted incomes the list of exempted incomes is long enough
as i've told and it includes awards for literary,
scientific and artistic works and other awards
by the government, pension received by recipient of gallantry awards,
there are two conditions which need to be satisfied for this partial integration
income of a member of a scheduled tribe
who are in specified areas
most of the northeastern states come under this
section ten ( 26) and our people staying in
scheduled tribe people staying in arunachal, meghallaya, nagaland etc
need not pay any amount of income tax
if the income is generated in that specified area
specified income of a sikkimese individual
tea boards subsidy, other subsidies like rubber, coffee,
cardamon, etc income from units of from the administrator
number one, the net agriculture income should exceed rs five thousand per annum
of specific undertaking, specified company, mutual fund
under section ten sub section thirty-five
income of educational institutions, income of hospitals
till assessment year one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine - two thousand there was blanket
exemptions in these two institutions
but as the government found that many of such institutions are established
for profit motive, and then since the assessment year one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine - two thousand
this blanket exemption is withdrawn
section ten sub section twenty-three c has been imposed
and there are certain conditions are there
secondly, the non agriculture income should exceed
if the institution satisfies those conditions,
then only exemptions will be provided from income tax act
there are tax holidays for newly established units
in special economic zones special economic zones are
created by the government to boost entrepreneurship,
to boost industrialization in a particular region
suppose a unit has begun or begins to manufacture
or produce articles or things or provide any service in any sez
during the previous year, relevant to the assessment year two thousand and six - seven
or subsequent assessment year, but not later than
the maximum amount not chargeable to tax
assessment year two thousand and twenty - twenty-one , such
established units will enjoy tax holiday
under section ten a of the income tax act,
section thirteen a of the income tax act gives exemption
from income earned by a political party from house property, capital gains
or other sources they will also earn income
by way of voluntary contribution but because of section thirteen a,
this political parties are exempted from payment of income tax
same way, section thirteen b has been inserted to give exemption
to electoral trust these are some of the main features of
at this moment, it is five lakhs for resident
the exempted income as provided by the income tax act one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one
thank you
that is very senior citizen, three lakh for residents senior citizen
and two hundred and fifty thousand for all other individuals and hufs
, if these two conditions are satisfied,
standard deduction, deduction for entertainment allowance
and deduction for professional taxes paid
so in the three items under section sixteen are deducted from gross salary,
we get the income from salary
the salary is taxable,
and there are different terms by which a salary may beknown
and income tax act tried to encompass all this kind of terms
it includes the basic salary,
there may be besides salary there will be
some payment in the form of dearness allowance, dearness pay
income from other sources
a person may receive advance salary,
a person may receive arrear salary
he may have leave encashment while in service,
leave incashmenttat the time of retirementor leaving the job,
salary in lieu of notice,
fees and commission,bonus, gratuity
he might be receiving or he she or she might be receiving
pension, pension may be monthly pension,
commuted pension,pension may be under
the new pension scheme
today,we'll be discussingin details
he or she may be received
annuity from employer there may be some
contribution from employers side in excess of a specified percentage
there will be retrenchment compensation the list is long enough
and the gross while calculating the gross salary,
all such incomesare calculated
to find outthe amount oftaxable income
how income is calculated under the headsalaries
there are three sections in the income tax act
for computation of income under the head salaries,
section fifteen talks about the chargeability
of income under the head income from salary
whereas section sixteen talks about the deductions
from salary income and section seventeen
discusses various meanings of salary perquisite,
welcome friends,to the discussion of the first head of income
profits in lieu of salary etc
, these are the three sections section fifteen section sixteen
section 17,which are devoted to the computation of income
under the head salaries
before we discuss the methodology for computation of
income under the head salaries,
let us clear certain important concepts which are related to salaries
number oneto come under the head salaries,
the income must have a relationship between employer and employee
that means the person who gives the income should be employer
under the income tax act
and the person who receives the income should be employee
, if there is no employer employee relationship
between the giver and taker, the income cannot come
under the head salaries even though the income is known assalary
for example, salary to a partner,
a partner in a partnership firm is a not an employee of the firm,
rather,he or she is one of the owners of the firm
so that's whythe salary of a partner received from the firm
cannot be treated as salary incomeas
the condition of employer employee relationship is missing
just to recapitulate as we already discussed,
so that salary to a partner will come underprofits and gains
of business and professionof that particularpartner
secondly, salaries and wages
there is no difference between the term salaries and wages,
though they are may be some
meaning difference in meaning in oxford dictionary
but as far as the income tax act is concerned,
salaries and wages are treated at part
it may happen that salary may be received from
more than one sources during a previous year
there are five heads of income
an employee may receive salary from more than one sources,
income tax will be charged on the total salary received by a person
during the previous year
that personmay be in full time
or part time employment,but income tax is not concerned with this
foregoing of salary that if an individual
forgoes his or her salary for a particular period,
in that case salary is calculated on due basis,
and as such income tax is chargeable
on the salary forgone by him or her
under whichthe income tax is calculated number one,
but in case of surrender of salary,
then if the salary is surrendered
for a specific cause or for a cause, which is raised by the government,
in that case, income tax is not chargeable
on the surrendered salary in case salary payee's paid tax free,
the employee or the assessee has to take back is to add back
the income tax partand then income tax will be computed on the total
income of the person
the place of accrual of salaries also important
which determines
income from salaries
the income of salary of a particular person
section fifteen of the income tax act deals with the basis of charge for salary
it says that salary is chargeable to tax
on due basisor receipt basis, whichever is earlier
that means,if the salary is received in advance,
income tax will be payable in case of arrear salary,
as the salary was not due at that point of time,
which received afterwards,the salary,
the income tax will be paid
on the year of on the time of receiptof the arrear salary
number two, income from house property
section seventeen of the income tax act
has categorizedsalary into three part it defines salary
under section seventeen ( 1), it defines perquisites
under section seventeen ( 2),
and profits in lieu of salaryunder section seventeen ( 3)
,we'll be discussing one by one in detail
about the meaning of these terms
section seventeen ( 1) define the term salaryand it includes
it is an inclusive definition
and includes monetary as well as non monetary items
number three,profits and gains of business and profession
for computation of salary,
we have to first find out the basic salary of the person
with itthe allowances are added
with it,the value of perquisite are added
with it, we add profits in lieu of salary and ultimately we get
the gross salary, which is aggregation of basic salary
allowances, perquisites and profits in lieu of salary
from gross salary, the deduction is provided
under section sixteen of the income tax act
andsection sixteen at this moment gives three kinds of deduction,
number four,capital gains and number five
section seventeen ( 3)discusses the profits in lieu of salary
rs thirty-six thousand secondly,
excess of rent paid over ten percent salary,
rent paidis thirty-one thousand, five hundred ten percent of salary is twenty-two thousand, eight hundred and fifty
and that's why the amount stands as rs eight thousand, six hundred and fifty
and third condition is as it is in kanpur,
so forty percent of salary which comes at rs ninety-one thousand, four hundred
, out of these three amount rs thirty-six thousand
rs eight thousand, six hundred and fifty and rs ninety-one thousand, four hundred the least is rs eight thousand, six hundred and fifty
and as such eight thousand, six hundred and fifty is exempted under section ten ( thirteen a)
of the act and the balance amount of rs twenty-seven thousand, three hundred and fifty
gpf,ppf insurance policy etc
is chargeable as house rent allowance
are not includedin the definition of profits in lieu of salary
and any amount received prior to employment
or after cessation of employment also are not included
in the definition of profits in lieu of salary
let's see the meaning of allowances
besides basic salary,an employer may give benefits
to the employeein two ways, either in cash or in kind
if it is given in cash, this is known asallowances,
if it is given in kind, these are known as perquisites
profits in lieu of salary includescompensation due
, let's see the different allowances and
the taxability of the allowances
there are three categories of allowances,
one is fully taxable allowance, that is, these allowances are fully taxable
there are fully exempted allowances,
that is these allowances are not chargeable to tax
and thirdly,partially exempted allowances,
that is part of this allowances is taxable and part is exempted
direct_tax_821
allowances which are fully taxable
or received from employer on termination,
includescity compensatory allowance,
entertainment allowance in most of the cases it is taxable
for government employees up to rs five thousand it is deductible
there are other allowances which will be known as tiffin allowance,
fixed medical allowance, service allowance
, in this way there may be different kinds of allowances
which arefully taxable under the income tax act
allowances which are partly taxable
number one happens to bethe house rent allowance
it is very interesting that if an employee
compensation due or receive from employer
is in receipt of house rent allowance
and resides in a rented house,
in that case,he or she may be allowed exemption under section ten ( thirteen a)
, there are three conditions being provided
number one,actual hra received,
number two,excess of rent paid over ten percent of salary
and number three, forty percent of salary,
but if the house is situated in any of the fourmetros,
now we can say the presidential citieslikekolkata,
mumbai,chennai and delhi
on modification of terms of employment,
in that case it is fifty percent of the salary
again i am repeating number one, the actual hra received;
number two, excess of rent paid over ten percent of salary
and number three, forty percent of salary or
fifty percent of salary as the case may be
among these three, the list
will be exempted under section ten ( thirteen a)
herethe meaning of salary
for these hra purposes when i was talking about forty percent of salary
fifty percent of salary or ten percent of salary,
any payment dueor receivedfrom employer
what does the salary mean?
interestingly the meaning of salary is different for different different purposes
for this hra purpose,
it includesbasic salary
plus dearness pay or dearness allowance,
if the terms of employment so provides
and thirdly commission,if commission is paid
as a fixed percentage of turnover
in that case salary eansthe aggregate ofthese three
let us discuss a problem
or former employerexcept exempted part of gratuity,
on house rent allowance
mr a,a resident of kanpur
receives rs two hundred and two thousand per annum
as basic salary during the previous year two thousand and seventeen - eighteen
in addition,he gets rs twenty thousand, two hundred per annum as dearness allowance,
forming part of basic salary
for computation of all retirement benefits,
seven percent commissionon sales made by him
andrs thirty-six thousand per annum as house rent allowance
are also given to mr a
hra, commuted pension,
sales made by mr a during the relevant previous year
is rs ninety thousand he pays rs thirty-one thousand, five hundred per annum as house rent
we have to determine the quantum of house rent allowance
which is exempt from tax
let's see the solution
first we have to calculate the salary
for the purpose of computing house rent allowance,
which is exempt from tax
and it works out to be rs two hundred and twenty-eight thousand, five hundred
that is, we calculate the basic salary
retrenchment compensation,rpf that is recognized provident fund etc
rs two hundred and two thousand plus dearness allowance
rs twenty thousand, two hundred dearness allowance will be included because it is a part of salary
and commission at the rate of seven percent on rs ninety thousand
which comes out at rs six thousand, three hundred commission is taken into
calculation of salary because commission is given
as a fixed percentage on turnover
,out of the house rent allowance received by mr a
rs thirty-six thousand the three conditions
are given and the least of these threewill be exempted from tax
number one,the actual house rent allowance received
payment from approved superannuation fund
the important points in hr exemption calculation is number one,
so uncommuted pension
are like salary which are paid monthly,
commuted pension is given in one lump sum
at the time ofretirement a person is free
toget a part of the pension as uncommuted,
a part of the pension as commuted
section ten ( ten a) provides exemption
in respect of commuted pension
as per section ten ( ten a)
the payment in respect of commuted pension is exempt,
but if it is provided for the part of the year,
specified there in
its treatment is discussed like
number a,employees of the central government,
local authorities,statutory corporation,
members of defence services
any commuted pension received
is fullyexempt from tax
in case of non government employees,
any commuted pension received is exempt from tax
in two circumstances, first one,if the employee
in that case, we can calculate on monthly basis
is in receipt of gratuity,
then one thirdof the total commuted pensionis exempted
but if the employee does not receive any gratuity,
then one half of the total
commuted value of pension isexempted
besides hra,there are other special allowances
to meet the expenses relating to dutiesor personal expenses
section ten ( 14) provides exemptions
either fullyor partially
to these special allowances
these special allowances or benefits,
are not being nature of a perquisite specially granted to meet expense
incurred wholly, unnecessarily and exclusively
we have to know the salary we have to know
in the performance of duties of an office or employment
but for theallowances under this category,there is no limit
on the amount which the employee can receive
from the employer, but whatever amount is received,
should be fully utilizedfor the purpose
for which it was given to him to avail the exemption,
otherwise, the unspent amountistaxable
the special allowances
may includetravelling allowance,convenience allowance,
helper allowance, uniform allowance,
the hra, which is received by the employee
daily allowance, research allowance etc
, the amount which is utilized
for this purposeis fullyexempted,
otherwise the unutilized amount will be taxable
there are some allowances, which are prescribed
for the purpose of section ten sub section fourteen (ii)
and the income tax act has given a list of such allowances
and also the amount which can be claimed
as exemption from such allowances
specialallowances like special compensatory
number three we have to know
hilly allowance,the exemption limits differs,
it may befrom rs three hundred
as high as rs two thousand, two hundred or anything like
border area allowance,special contingency allowance
because of on the basis of the toughness of the location,
the allowanceslimits are also enhanced
children and education allowance is the common allowance which is being given
by the employer to the employee,
the exemption limit is rs one hundred per month
per childto a maximum of two children,
the amount of rent paid by the employee
but if such children residein hostels,
in that case, the exemption limit will be
rs three hundred per month per child for a maximum oftwo children
, in this way there are
compensatory field area allowances of
two thousand, six hundred per month in specified areas is exempted,
compensatory modified
field area allowances rs one thousand per month
is exempted and the list is long
and enough there is an insurgency allowance
and number four,the place where the house is takenon rent
and the exemption limit is rs three thousand, nine hundred per month
whereas, in case of transport allowance,
it is rs one thousand, six hundred per month
there is also underground allowance
for thisan amount of rs eight hundred per month is exempted
direct_tax_987
regarding transport allowance
till assessment year two thousand and eighteen - nineteen
rs one thousand, six hundred per monthwas exempted for all employees
other than specially abled because they had a higher amount of exemption
,if we know these four figures,
butto the normal people,
this one thousand, six hundred per monthexemption under transport allowance is not available
from the assessment year two thousand and nineteen - twenty
, allowances which are fully exempt
allowances to high court judges,
allowances receivedfrom united nations organization,
compensatory allowance under section two hundred and twenty-two ( 2) of the constitution,
sumptuary allowance, allowances payable to outside india
these are some of the allowances
which are totally or fully exempt from income tax
in that case, we can calculate
let's discuss the term pension
concise oxford dictionary defines pension as a periodic payment
made speciallyby governmentor a company
or other employers to the employee
in consideration of past service
payable after his retirement the pension is of two types,
commuted pension and uncommuted pension
commuted pension is a lump sum,
which is givento the employee
at the time of his or herretirement
the exemption as provided under section ten ( thirteen a) of the income tax act
uncommuted pension are paid monthly
uncommuted pension refersto pension received
periodically normally monthly it is fully taxable
in the hands ofboth government and non government employees
in case of commuted pension,
commutation means interchange,
that is commuted pension means lump sum amount
taken by commuting the whole or part of the pension
many persons converttheir future right
to receive pensionin a lump sum amount receivable immediately
if it is providedon annual normally does calculate on an annual basis,
it will be interesting to do aproblem
, let's see case four whilemr c
receives gratuity in that case, maximum amount exempt from tax
will be one third of rs four lakhthat is rs one hundred and thirty-three thousand, three hundred and thirty-three
as the amount received in commutation of pension
is less than the maximum amount exempt from tax
nothing is chargeable to tax
one third of his pension commuted for rs ninety thousand
, let's see what would happen
for calculation of taxable pension
while uncommuted pension is chargeable to tax,
commuted pension is exempted from tax
in the case of government employee
therefore, whatever the amount of commuted pension,
that is the commuted pension of rs ninety-two thousand is exempt from tax
the amount of uncommuted pension
is calculated as under
on taxable amount of pension
uncommuted pension up to february two thousand and nineteen
that is rs nine hundred into eight rs seven thousand, two hundred
an uncommuted pension for the month of march two thousand and nineteen
total pension was uncommuted pension was nine hundred ,
one third is commuted so he will get two thirds of these
so two third into rs nine hundred into one month,
it comes to rs six hundred , the total is seven thousand, eight hundred
on this amount income tax is chargeable
now see case two mr b
retires from a private firm b limited on august thirty-one two thousand and eighteen
let's see an example
he gets pension of rs one thousand per month
up to january thirty-one two thousand and nineteen
with effect from february one two thousand and nineteen he gets
sixty percent of pension commutedfor rs one hundred and seventy thousand
the question is, does it make any difference
if he also receives gratuity
of rs four thousand at the time of retirement?
let's see the solution
in this case mr b is a non government employee
so while uncommuted pension is fully chargeable to tax,
determine the taxable amount of pension
like salary, commuted pension is partly chargeable
to and partly exempt from tax the amount of pension
will be taxable as under
regarding the uncommuted pension
that is from august thirty-one two thousand and eighteen to january thirty-one two thousand and nineteen
one thousand per month into five rs five thousand
an uncommuted pension from february one to march thirty-one for two months,it is rs eight hundred
, total uncommuted pension chargeable to tax
is rs five thousand, eight hundred regarding the commuted value that is sixty percent is commuted
is rs one hundred and seventy thousand , we can calculate the
for the assessment year two thousand and nineteen - twenty in the following cases:
commuted value of full pension
that is one hundred and seventy thousand into one hundred by sixty
, we get the value of full pensionis two hundred and eighty-three thousand, three hundred and thirty-three
, suppose mr b does not receive gratuity
in that case the amount exempt will be
one halfof the total commuted value of pension
that is half into two hundred and eighty-three thousand, three hundred and thirty-three
that is rs one hundred and forty-one thousand, six hundred and sixty-seven will be exempted
, the chargeable amount of commuted pension will be
one hundred and seventy thousand minus one hundred and forty-one thousand, six hundred and sixty-seven that is rs
case onemr a retires from the central government services
twenty-eight thousand, three hundred and thirty-three is chargeable to tax
suppose mr b receives gratuity,
the amount exempt will be one third of the commuted value of pension
that is 1/3 of two hundred and eighty-three thousand, three hundred and thirty-three
which is ninety-four thousand, four hundred and forty-four , the commuted value of pension
which is chargeable to tax a salary
is rs one hundred and seventy thousand minus ninety-four thousand, four hundred and forty-four that is seventy-five thousand, five hundred and fifty-six
, let's seecase three
mr c retires from c ltd on march thirty-one two thousand and eighteen
c ltd paysrs two thousand, six hundred per month
on june thirty two thousand and eighteen he gets pension
as pensionbut does not pay any gratuityon the request of mr
c limited pays rs one lakhin lieu of commutation of
twenty-five percent of pension on february twenty-eight two thousand and nineteen
in such case, what would be the taxable amount?
let's seethat the amount of pension taxable as
salary will be computed as uncommuted pension
from april one two thousand and eighteen to february twenty-eight two thousand and nineteen
that is rs two thousand, six hundred into eleven is rs twenty-eight thousand, six hundred
uncommuted pension from march one two thousand and nineteen
to march thirty-one two thousand and nineteen that is rs two thousand, six hundred
of rs nine hundred per month, up to february, two thousand and nineteen
seventy-five percent of it for one month, it is one thousand, nine hundred and fifty
, total uncommuted pension chargeable to tax
will be thirty thousand, five hundred and fifty regarding commuted pension,
commuted value of twenty-five percent of the usual pension is rs one lakh
,the commuted value of full pension will be
one lakh into hundred divided by twenty-five
that is rs four lakhs , maximum amount exempt from tax
ishalf of rs four lakh
as mr c does not receive gratuity,
, half of rs four lakh is rs two lakh
that is rs nine hundred into eight
but as the amount received in commutation of
pensionis less than the maximum amount exempt from tax
nothing is chargeable to tax
, maximum amount exempt from tax
in casemr c receives gratuity
will be one third of total commuted value of pension
, one third into rs four lakh is equal to rs one hundred and thirty-three thousand, three hundred and thirty-three
but as the amount received in commutation of pension
is less than the maximum amount exempt from tax,
nothing is chargeable to tax
with effect frommarch one 2019,he gets,
now let's discuss about section ten ( 10),
which is recognized by the commissioner of income tax
one is unrecognized provident fund
which is not recognized by the commissioner of income tax
there is statutory provident fund or general provident fund
we call it spfor gpf
which is normally applicable to the government employees
and there is open to all which is known as public provident fund
there are different types of tax treatments
for these four types of provident fund
likeemployer's contribution
the rule is thatany death-cum gratuity
it is a benefit which is received byan employee
in that case,it attracts the income taximposition,
but in case of recognized provident fund
any amount up to twelve percent of salary is not taxable
that means any amount in excess of twelve %is taxable
in case of unrecognized provident fund,
employers contribution whatever amount
the employer contributes, it is not taxable
in case of recognized provident fund, it isfully exempted
but in case of public provident fund,
is exempt from tax to the extent of least of the following
normally the employer does not provide
contribution on public provident fund,
public provident fund is created by the employeeon their own
regarding employees contribution,
employees contributing, spending some amount for good reasons
so, that's why he or she should be eligible
for deduction under section eighty c
let's see whether he or she is eligible or not
in case of recognized provident fund,
the entire moneywhich he or she contributes to recognize
number one,rs, ten lakhs it is enhanced to rs, twenty lakhs
provident fund is eligible for deduction
in case of unrecognized provident fund, it is not eligible
in case of statutory provident fund
and public provident fund in both these cases
whatever amount the employee contributes,
the amountis eligible for deduction under section eighty c
regarding the interest credited,
in case of recognized provident fund,
the amount in excess of nine five percent per annum is taxable
in case of statutory provident fund and public provident fund,
frommarch twenty-nine two thousand and eighteen number 2,actual gratuity received,
it is fully exempted and in case of undrecognized provident fund,
it is not taxable at the moment
at the time of retirement,
when a person's received lump sum amount,
in case of recognized provident fund,
it is exempted in almost all cases
except a very few cases if the employee
has not completed five years of service
in those cases it may be taxable,
otherwise in majority of cases, it is nottaxable
number three fifteen days salary
in case of public provident fund also it is exempted
in case of gpf or spf,
it is exempted,but in case of unrecognized provident fund,
the employers contribution
and interest their own is fully taxable
in the year in which the amount is received by
the employee from unrecognized provident fund
based onthe last ten months average salary drawn
for each completed year of service
or part thereofin excess ofsix months
salary for this purpose means basic salaryand dearness allowance
and number of days in a month
which talks on exemption from gratuity
for this calculation is taken as twenty-six
for the non government employees
who are not covered under the payment of gratuity act,
there are also three conditions provided
number 1,rs ten lakhs
number two gratuity actually received
number three half month salary
that is based on last ten months average salary
for each completed year of service
here,we ignore the fraction
retirement gratuity received
and salary for the purpose means basic salary
and dearness allowance,if provided in the terms of employment
for the retirement benefitsforming part of the salary
and also commissionif it is given as a fixed percentage on
turnover salary includes fees, commission,
perquisites, or profits in lieu of salary
and also it includes advanced salary,
leave salary, leave encashment etc
, let's discuss the amount
which is received by a person
under the pension code regulations applicable to members of
as encashment ofunutilized earned leave
at the time of retirement
just to note thatif this amount is received
during service, it is fully taxable,
but if it is received at the time of retirement,
then exemption is available under section ten sub section ( ten aa)
for government employees,
the leave salary received at the time of retirement
is fully exempt from tax
for non government employees there are four conditions
defence serviceis fully exempt from tax
number one,the leave salary actually received
number two ten months salary
on the basis of average of last ten months,
cash equivalent of leave notavailed
an earned leave entitlement can not exceed thirty days
for every year of actual service
and number four there is a limitof rsthree lakhs
out of this four the least is exempted
under section ten ( ten a a)from the amount received as leave encashment
section ten ( ten b) provides exemption from the amount
central state government employees, any death cum

the retrenchment compensation will be exemptunder section ten ( ten b)
there are two conditions
number one,the amount which is calculated
in accordance with the industrial disputes act one thousand, nine hundred and forty-seven
orthe amount not less than rs five lakhs
as may be notified by the central government,
whichever is lower so that amount is exempted

for non government employees there are two categories
any state government, central government
or any institute of special importance,
all these are eligible undertakings under this section
direct_tax_1270
the limit, the maximum limit of exemption
should not exceed rupees five lakhs
before we discuss about perquisites and his valuation,
let's clear the concept of provident fund
provident fund is created
forthe future security of an employee
one, is non government employees covered
andthe credit balance in a provident fundconsists of
employees contribution, interest on employees contribution,
employer's contribution, interest onemployers contribution
so with all these four
the provident fund is created
and which helps the employee
at the time of his or her retirement
as he or she getsa lump sum amount
from this particular fund there are different types of provident fund
one isthe recognized provident fund,
under the payment of gratuity act one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two
let us now discuss about perquisites
secondly, where the accommodation is provided
byany other employer
number one,where the accommodation is owned by the employer
in that case fifteen percent of the salary
will be taxablein cities whose population
exceeding twenty-five lakhs as per two thousand and one census,
but it would be ten percent of salary in cities
having population exceeding ten lakhs but not exceeding twenty-five lakhs
as per two thousand and one census
about it will be seven five percent of salary in other cities
number one the rent free accommodation
in respect of the periodwhich the said accommodation is provided
, this is the rule forunfurnished house
for a bigger cities,
it is fifteen percent of salary for a medium cities
it is ten percent of salaryand for other places,
it is seven five percent of salary is the valuation and as usual, it will be increased by
ten percent of original cost of furniture
or actual rent on furniture in case of furnished houses
where the accommodation is taken on lease in that case,
actual lease amount or rent
which is given by the employer to the employee
or fifteen percent of salary whichever is lower is taken as the valuation
, all such valuation will be reduced by the amount
which is charged from the employee as rent by the employer
in case of furnished house in all cases
ten percent of the original cost of furniture
or actual rent of furniturewill be added
to this valuation where the accommodation is
provided by the employer in a hotel,
in that case twenty-four percent of the salary paid
or payableor the actual charge paid
secondly,the concessional accommodation,
whichever is lower will be
valuation of the house or the accommodation
and it will be reduced by any amount of rent which is charged from the
employee and there is no question of
furnishing as because the accommodation is provided in a hotel
the meaning of salary includes pay,
allowances, bonusor commission payable monthly or otherwise,
or any other monetary payments by whatever name called
from one or more employers,but it does not include
the dearness allowance or dearness pay if it is not a part of salary,
third payment by the employer in
employers contribution to provident fund,
allowances which are exempt from tax, value of perquisites,
any payment of expenditure specially excluded
under provision of section seventeen ( 2), butthese excluding these
all other allowances, pay, bonus, commission etc
are included for the purpose of salary
in calculatingthe valuation for rent free accommodation
music
respect of an obligation to the employeethat means any amount,
whichwas otherwise to be payable by the employee
is paid by the employer such benefitsor such
extra benefits which are being given by the employer to the employee
is taxable as perquisites in the hands of all employees
payment by the employer in respect of an obligation of an employee
perquisites is the extra additional benefit,
that means the any amountwhich would otherwise
have to be paid by the employee is paid by the employer,
such amount is taxable in the hands of
employee as a perquisite
and it is applicable to all kinds of employees
i can give a small example, that if a domestic servant
is engaged by an employee at his or her own home,
and the employer reimburses the salary to the
of the servant,it means it is an obligation
which the employee would have to be discharged,
which is given by the employer
but the employer is paying the money in that case,
it is an obligation of the employee paid by employer
the list of taxable perquisite includes
any specified security or sweat equity shares
allottedto the employee by the employer at a concessional price
or any amountof contributed
to the approved superannuation fund etc
perquisites exempt in all cases,
there are certain benefits or perquisites
these are exempted from tax
to the employeein addition to basic salary
that is, even if these benefits are received by the employee,
these are not at all taxable the list is long enough
it starts with telephone,
transport facilities, refreshments etc
music
let's discuss the perquisites which are taxable only
in the hands of specified employees
now, who are the specified employees specified employees,
may be one who is the director employee,
that the employee of a company who is also a director
if these benefits are given in terms of cash,
or an employee who has got substantial interest in the company,
substantial interest means any employee
who has got the beneficial ownership in equity shares
carryingvoting rights of twenty percent or more
and thirdly, employees drawing a salary of
rupees fifty thousand plus, that is income chargeable under the head
exceeds rupees fifty thousand such employees are known as
specified employees the perquisites which are exempted
from non specified employees include service of sweeper,
gardener, watchmen, personal attendant
these are known as allowances which we have already discussed
supply of gas electricity, water for household purposes,
education facility for employees family members,
leave travel concession, medical facility,
car or any other automotive convenience,
transport facilities by a transport undertaking
so, for non specified employees,
this particular perquisites are exempted
, let us discuss the valuation of perquisites
there is a problem in perquisites,
in case of allowances, these are given in cash,
but if this is given in terms of kind
but in case of perquisites, these are given in kind
so, when some benefits are given in kind,
there is a problem of valuation of the benefitsin terms of money
, let's see the valuation of residential accommodation
music
for the purpose of computing income
chargeable under the head salary,
the valuation of perquisites provided
by the employer directly or indirectly to the employee,
employeeor any other member of household
or in kind these are known as perquisites
shall be determined in accordance with rule three
sub rule one of rule three
let us discuss the valuation of rent free accommodation
under different circumstances
number one,where the accommodation is provided by the central government
or any state governmentto the employees
either holding office or post in connection with the
affairs of union or the state,
in that case for unfurnished house,
the valuation will be the license fee determined by the central government
or colloquially we may call it perks
or any other state governmentin respect of
accommodationin accordance with the rules
framed by the government and as reduced by
the rent actually paid by the employee
, it is the license fee, which is the main in case of
any government employees
iffurniture is also provided,
in that case ten percent of the cost of furnitureor
if the furnitures are taken on rent
then actual rent will be added to the valuation
there are some perquisites which are taxable in all cases
let's see the valuation of motorcar
of gift voucher or token in lieu of such gifts it is the sum
equal to the amount have such gifts however, if the value of
such gift or voucher is below rupees five thousand in aggregate during
the previous year, in that case, the value of perquisites will be
taken as nil sometimes the employer also provides or
reimburses the credit card expenses, the amount of
expenses, including membership fees, annual fees provided by
the employer or otherwise paid or reimbursed by such employer
shall be taken to the value of perquisite, chargeable to tax as
reduced by the amount, if any paid or recovered from the
employer on running and maintaining the motorcar during
employee for such benefit however, if such expenses are
incurred wholly or exclusively for official purposes, it would
not be treated as a perquisites regarding the club
expenditure that any amount of expenditure incurred or
reimbursed by such employer on that account the amount so,
determined shall be reduced by the amount if any paid or recovered from
the employee for such benefit or amenity however,
where the employer has obtained corporate membership of the club
and the facility is enjoyed by the employee or any other member
of his household,the value of perquisite shall not include the
the relevant previous year, including remuneration if any
initial fee paid for acquiring such corporate membership
regarding the use of movable assets, which are facilitated by
the employer to the employee, in case of laptops and computers,
there is no valuation that is the value of perquisites
should be taken as nil but in case of other movable assets,
other than laptop computers, then ten percent of the actual cost of
such asset or the amount of rent or charge paid that is are being
payable by the employer will be taken as the valuation of
perquisite in case of any other benefit or amenity, the value
of any other benefit or amenities, service, right or
paid by the employer to the chauffeur as increased by the
privilege provided by the employer shall be determined on
the basis of cost to the employer under an arm's length
transaction as reduced by the employees contribution, if any
, this is a blanket provision that is made under
the income tax act one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one however, there will be no
taxable perquisite in respect of expenses on telephone, including
mobile phones, actually incurred on behalf of the employee by the
employer that is, if an employer pays or reimburses
telephone bills, or mobile phone charges of employees, including
private uses, there will be no taxable perquisites
amount representing normal wear and tear is charged to tax but
valuation of specified security or sweat equity shares the fair market value of any
specified security or sweat equity shares being an equity
share in a company on the date on which the option is exercised
by the employee shall be the valuation where any amount has
been recovered from the employee, the same shall be
deducted to arrive at the value of perquisites valuation of
specified security not being an equity shares in a company for
this purpose the fair market value of any specified security
not being an equity share of a company on the date on which the
option is exercised by the employee shall be the value as
the most complexity comes if it is used partly in performance of
determined by a merchant banker on the specified date
duties and partly in private purposes in that case, if the
engine of the car is up to one six litre, then one thousand, eight hundred per month will
be the valuation of the motorcar, if the engine capacity
is more than one thousand, six hundred cc or one six litre capacity, in that case,
the valuation will be two thousand, four hundred per month, if the chauffeur is also
when the motorcar is provided to the employee, by the employer,
given, in that case, rupees nine hundred per month will be added
additionally if the expenses of running and maintenance for
private or personal use is made by the assessee, then the valuation
will be rupees six hundred per month for cars up to one thousand, six hundred cc and rupees
nine hundred per month, for cars more than one thousand, six hundred cc let's see the
valuation of domestic servants the value of benefit to the
employee or any member of the household resulting from the
provision by the employer of the services of sweeper, gardener,
watchman, personnel attendant shall be the cost to the
employer and the actual cost in such case shall be the total
it is a very important perquisites and for this particular
amount of salary paid or payable by the employer or any other
person for such services as reduced by any amount paid by
the employee for such services but there is a note that when a
house is owned by the employer, an employer incurs the
expenditure for maintenance of garden it is not taken as
perquisites in the hands of employee, because it is for the
upkeepment off employers house the employer, himself or herself
has appointed the servant it is not a personal benefit to the
employee for validation of gas, electricity or water supplied by
the employer if payment is made to an agency, supplying gas,
benefit, it is valued as per the rules under income tax act
electricity, water etc the value of benefit to the employee
shall be determined as the sum equal to the amount paid on
account by the employer to the agency supplying gas,
electricity or water if the supply is made from the
resources owned by the employer, the value of perquisites would be
the manufacturing cost per unit incurred by the employer and if
any amount is charged from the employee that amount will be
reduced from this valuation valuation of free or concessional
educational facilities
the sum equal to the amount of expenditure incurred by the
number one where the motor car is owned or hired by the employer
employer in that behalf or if the educational institution is
maintained and owned by the employer, or if free educational
facilities are allowed in respect of educational
institutions, by reason of being in the employment of that
employer, the value of perquisites shall be determined with
reference to cost of such education in a similar
institution or in near locality, where any amount is paid or
recovered from the employee on that account the value of
benefit shall be reduced by the amount so paid or recovered
however, where the educational institutions itself is
and is used wholly and exclusively for the performance
maintained and owned by the employer, and free educational
facilities are provided to the children of the employee or such
free educational facilities are provided in any institutions by
reason of his or her inemployment of that employer
then there will be no perquisites , if the cost of such
education or value of such benefit per child does not
exceed rupees one thousand per month regarding free or concessional
tickets, value at which the benefit or amenities offered by
such employer to the public and reduced by the amount if any
paid or recovered from the employee for such benefit or
of official duties by the employee it is not a
amenity, then this would be the valuation but however,
there will be no such perquisites to the employees of
an airline or railways
valuation of other fringe benefits and amenities like
interest free or concessional loan, interest computed at the
rate charged per annum by the state bank of india as reduced
by the interest, if any is actually paid by the employee
will be the valuation however, no value would be charged, if
loans are made available for medical treatment in respect of
prescribed diseases like cancer, tb or where the loan amount of
perquisites at all, as the employees is not getting any particular
loans are not exceeding to the aggregate rupees twenty thousand ,then
this is not a perquisites at all regarding traveling touring
and accommodation, if these expenses are paid or
reimbursed by the employer and if such facilities are
maintained by the employer,
or if the expenses are paid if it is an official tour, or if
the official tour is extended as vacation, the valuation will be
as per the cost incurred by the employer for extending the
benefits to the employee regarding the provision for
providing free or concessional food or non alcoholic beverage,
own benefit but if it is exclusively used for private and
during the office hours in the business premises or in the
official premises, through paid vouchers, which are not
transferable and in the case it does not exceed rupees fifty per
men or if it is the tea or snacks which are provided during
the working hours, free food and non alcoholic beverage, if these
are provided in a remote area or offshore interrelations in that
case, these are exempted perquisites, that is free food
or non alcoholic beverage, if it is more than rupees fifty per meal
in that case only it would attract the taxation and the
perquisites will be valued accordingly regarding the value
personal use, then actual amount of expenditure incurred by the
before we close the discussion on perquisite, let me refer to
two thousand and eighteen - nineteen if we see the solution, the basic salary is rs four hundred and eighty-six thousand
allowance is also fully taxable thirty-three thousand, one hundred
education allowance received by him is two thousand, three hundred and forty for three children,
but the exemption amount will be for two children and which comes
to rs one thousand, five hundred and sixty the exemption limit as already has been
discussed is rupees one hundred per month per child for a maximum of
two children, in this case it would be one thousand, five hundred and sixty and from two thousand, three hundred and forty one thousand, five hundred and sixty
will be exempted and seven hundred and eighty rupees will be taxable house rent
allowance he received is forty-six thousand, two hundred but, there are three conditions
be taxable from the assessment year two thousand and nineteen - twenty as this exemption
which is given under section ten ( 13)a, number 1,actual hra
received ,number two, excess of rent paid over ten percent salary and
number three forty percent of salary if we calculate these three, we'll
find one is one hundred and seventy rupees , one hundred and seventy rupees being the least amount
will be exempted from forty-six thousand, two hundred , the balance amount of forty-six thousand and thirty
is taxable reimbursement of medical expenditure exempted up
to rs fifteen thousand but he has received eighteen thousand, eight hundred and ninety , balance
rs three thousand, eight hundred and ninety is taxable reimbursement of expenditure on
books and journals for official work is not treated as a perquisite
, the value will be nil and regarding the car is as it is
has been withdrawn next, the premium paid to the effect of an
for official as well as personnel use of one thousand, two hundred cc which
is less than one thousand, six hundred cc , it would be one thousand, eight hundred per month for twelve
months and as driver is given, so, rs nine hundred per month will be
chargeable extra , total valuation of car comes thirty-two thousand, four hundred
say, if we add up the basic salary, dearness allowance, city
compensatory allowance, education allowance, the texable
portion, house rent allowance the taxable portion, then
reimbursement of medical expenditure and valuation of
car the gross salary comes at rs six hundred and ninety-four thousand, five hundred
insurance on the health of such employees amount paid towards
expenditure incurred outside india for medical treatment up
to rupees two lakhs it is not taxable, but in some cases it
may be taxable , these are the rules for valuation of
medical facilities , we may summarize
the deductions from salary which are available when we add up the
basic salary allowances, value of perquisites ,profits in lieu
of salary, we get the gross salary from gross salary, the
the medical facilities when these are not taken as perquisites
deductions are available under section sixteen number one is the
standard deduction, which is provided under section sixteen
subsection one it is rupees forty thousand but from assessment year
two thousand and twenty - twenty-one this is increased to rupees fifty thousand second one is the
entertainment allowance under section sixteen subsection two it is
only available to government employees to the extent of
rupees five thousand and thirdly, it is professional tax, it is fully
deductible on payment basis , from gross salary, these three
deductions are available under the head salary regarding
entertainment allowance as deductions, i have already
that is the value of medical treatment in any hospital
told that this is available only in case of government employees
and the least of the following three is exempted number one,
one fifth of the basic salary, number two, entertainment allowance
actually received and thirdly, rupees five thousand the least
of these three is exempted under the head entertainment allowance
under section sixteen professional tax is a tax which is levied by
the state government in which the employees working
professional tax or taxes on employment levied by a state
under article two hundred and seventy-six of the constitution is allowed as a
deduction only when it is actually paid by the employee
maintained by the employer secondly, reimbursement of
during the previous year there is a recent amendment the
finance minister arun jaitley, the finance minister
introduced standard deduction in the budget of two thousand and eighteen - nineteen effective
from two thousand and nineteen - twenty giving salaried class something to rejoice about
the standard deduction of rupees forty thousand replaced the transport
allowance exemption of rupees nineteen thousand, two hundred ,medical reimbursement of
rupees fifteen thousand per month
,
interestingly the provision of standard deduction was there
earlier in the finance act two thousand and five and they are usually deducted
expenditure actually incurred on medical treatment at any
from the gross salary , the government has proposed the
amendments and accordingly the standard deduction is
reintroduced and from the assessment year two thousand and twenty - twenty-one the amount will be
rupees fifty thousand sometimes the salary is received in arrear, when
a huge amount is received in subsequent year as arrear of
salary
the assessee can claim relief under section eighty-nine and he can or she
can spread the income over the years for which the income is
actually received as an arrear salary
thereby,
hospital maintained by the government, local authority, any
some amount of tax can be reduced to end
the chapter of income from salary we can say that the
meaning of salary is different for different purposes for hra,
for gratuity, leave encashment, rpf it means basic plus da
or dearness pay, if it is a part of salary plus commission, if it is
given as a
fixed percentage on turnover
but for valuation of rent free or concessional accommodation
,it is basic plus da or dearness pay plus commission plus bonus plus fees
plus taxable allowances, monetary benefits etc for
other hospital approved by the government for the purpose of
entertainment allowance, this is the basic only for employees
that is under the payment of gratuity act, it means basic
plus da or dp,if it is received by the employee we will see a
comprehensive problem of salary mr a age of fifty-five years is in the
teaching staff of a private college in bangalore owned by b
limited during the previous year two thousand and seventeen - eighteen he gets the following
emoluments: basic salary rs four hundred and eighty-six thousand ;dearness
allowance rs ninety-two thousand, three hundred so dearness allowance is forming
part of salary, city compensatory allowance rs
thirty-three thousand, one hundred ,children allowance rs two thousand, three hundred and forty he's being paid at the rate
medical treatment of its employees reimbursement of
of rs sixty-five per month for three children, house rent allowance
rs forty-six thousand ,rent paid rs fifty-eight thousand and remuneration from
bangalore university for acting as paper setter and examiner rs
eighty-six thousand, four hundred expenditure incurred by mr a ,in this regard is rs three thousand, four hundred
he gets rs eighteen thousand, eight hundred and ninety as reimbursement from the employer
in respect of expenditure incurred on medical treatment of
his family members from a doctor besides, he gets rs twelve thousand, six hundred as
reimbursement from employer in respect of books and journals
purchased by him for discharging his official work the employer
provides one thousand, two hundred cc car for official and private purposes
expenditure actually incurred for medical treatment to the
the entire expenditure on salary of driver and running and
maintenance of car, which approximately comes to rs
ninety-two thousand, three hundred is borne by the employer he contributes eleven percent of his salary
in recognized provident fund, to which a matching contribution is
made by the employer during the year ,he spends rs three thousand on
purchase of books for teaching purposes, but this amount is not
reimbursed by employer besides he makes an expenditure of
rs sixty thousand as insurance premium of own life insurance
policy since two thousand and fifteen sum assured being rs fifteen lakhs
determine the gross salary of mr a for the assessment year
extent of rupees fifteen thousand but incidentally, this amount will
under the head income from house property
, if we see the definition
we get four conditions for the chargeability
number one, the property should consist of any building
or land appurtenant thereto
number two, the assessee must be the owner of the property
that means, if he or she is not the owner of the property
the income will not come under the head income from house property
suppose, a person has taken a property on rent
and it has been sublet to some other person,then,
welcome learners this week we will be learning income from
the income from subletting will not come under the head
income from house property as because
the assessee is not the owner of the property
it would be treated under income from other sources
third condition the property may be used for any purpose,
but it should not be used by the owner for the purpose of any business
or profession, carried on by him,
the profit of which is chargeable to tax
in such case such income will come under
the profits and gains of business or profession
house property, section twenty-two to twenty-seven of the income tax act
and fourthly, property held as stock in trade for first one year,
the annual value will be taken as nil ,these are the condition for
chargeability for any income to be included under
the income from house property before we go for any other discussion,
let us clear one concept called composite rent
the owner of a property may sometimes receive rent in respect of building
as well as the other assets like say furniture,
plant and machinery, or for different purposes for the services
provided in the building for example, lift, security,
power, backup, etc the amount so received is known as
are devoted to income from house property
composite rent , what is the tax treatment for composite rent,
the composite rent has to be split up in two parts
number one, the sum attributable to the use of property
is to be assessed under section twenty-two as income from house property,
that means any income which is related to the property itself
and number two, the sum attributable to the use of
services is to be charged to tax under the head profits and gains
from business or profession or any other or the head under
income from other sources as the case may be
, there is a problem of splitting up of the composite rent,
, to be eligible to come under the head income from house property,
if the let out building and the other assets are inseparable
in that case, the income prom composite rent
will not come under the head income from house property,
but if the the let out of building and other assets are separable,
then the building part will come under the head
income from house property and the use of other assets,
the income from use of other assets will come under the head
either profits and gains of business or profession
or income from other sources income from house property situated outside india
, if a person receives income from house property,
any income must satisfy certain conditions,
which is situated outside india, in case of a resident in india
that is in case of a resident and ordinarily resident
income from property situated outside india is taxable
whether such income is received in india brought to india or not,
but in case of non resident or resident but not already resident in india
income from property situated outside india
is taxable only if it is received in india
before we see the computation of income tax for house property income
let's see what are the house property income which are exempt from tax
there are certain incomes which are earned from house property
which are given under section twenty-two of the act
but are exempted from tax number one , income from farm house
that is, it is an agricultural income it is not taxable
secondly, income of one palace of an ex ruler,
we had different ex rulers before annexation to india
the government of india when the income tax act was enacted
it was decided that the ex ruler will be given a choice
any one palace of an ex ruler will be exempted from income tax
then property income of a local authority,
property income of an approved scientific research association
property income of university or educational institutions,
it says the annual value of any property
property income of hospital or medical institutions,
property income of a trade union, house property held for charitable purposes
property income of a political party ,
property used for business or profession
and lastly, one self occupied property
from assessment year two thousand and twenty - twenty-one it will be too
self occupied property held by the assessee
, these are the house properties whose incomes are
explicitly exempted from tax under the income tax act
comprising of buildings or land appurtenant thereto
of which the assessee is the owner is chargeable to tax
under section twenty-three the determination of annual value
there are deductions under section twenty-four subsection one
and there are two deductions number one standard deduction
which is thirty percent of the nav , discuss in detail,
an interest on borrowed capital
when these two deductions are made from net annual value
we get ultimately the income from house property
, let's see the determination of annual value
for different types of house properties
before we see the different types of house properties and its determination
that has clear one concept called expected rent
the determination of annual value goes for
expected rent is actually dependent on three factors or three figures,
so to say, number one municipal valuation
we will mention it as mv in our further discussions
secondly, fair rent of the property
fair rent says that what is the normal rate of such
kind of property in the locality and standard rent of the
property sr standard rate is if the rent control act
is enforced, then the standard rent of the property
and expected rent is the higher of municipal valuation or fair rent
subject to maximum of standard rent, the expected rent
calculation of net annual value or nav,
cannot exceed standard rent, it is the higher of municipal valuation and fair rent
, let's see a situation where the property is let out
throughout the previous year in that case, the gross annual value
will be the higher of expected rent and actual rent
received or receivable during the year
let us take one example suppose there are five houses, house one, house two,
house three, house four and house five and we have municipal value
municipal value of house one is eighty thousand house two thirty-five thousand
house three sixty-five thousand house four, twenty-four thousand and house five eighty thousand
in this way, the fair rent ninety thousand sixty thousand sixty-five thousand twenty-five thousand seventy-five thousand
which is the gross annual value minus municipal tax paid in the previous year
standard rent suppose in case of house one standard rate is not
applicable because rent control act is not applicable in that locality
but for house two there is a standard rent of seventy-five thousand
house three is fifty-eight thousand house four suppose standard rent
is not applicable because when control act is not applicable,
and house five,78000 then actual rent received or receivable
in case of house one seventy-two thousand in case of house two seventy-two thousand
in case of house three, sixty thousand in case of house four, thirty thousand
in case of house five,72000
now, from this example, if we want to calculate the
but let us see in detailand let us see the format of
expected rent and gav then how should we do
that first let us plot the municipal valuation
and then it is the fair rent
in case of house one the municipal value is rupees eighty thousand
fair rent is ninety thousand , higher of one and two that is municipal valuation
and fair rent is ninety thousand standard rent is not applicable
in that case expected rent will be
higher is number three higher of one and two
that is rupees ninety thousand and actual rent received and receivable is seventy-two thousand
, gross annual value will be higher of expected rent and actual rent
computation of income from house property
that is ninety thousand and seventy-two thousand higher of these two is ninety thousand
taking the example for house two, municipal valuation is fifty-five thousand
fair rent is sixty thousand so, higher of one and two,
that is sixty thousand standard rent is seventy-five thousand
, expected rent is higher of one and two is sixty thousand
it cannot exceed the standard rent that is seventy thousand seventy-five thousand
, expected rent will be sixty thousand
actual rent received is seventy-two thousand , gross annual value is
higher of expected rent and actual rent it comes seventy-two thousand
,in this way, there are house three, house four and house five
as the format shows, it starts with gross annual value,
suppose in case of house five, the higher of municipal valuation
and fair rent is eighty thousand but standard rent is seventy-eight thousand
, the expected rent is seventy-eight thousand it cannot exceed standard rent
actual rent is seventy-two thousand , gross annual value in case of house five
is rupees seventy-eight thousand , this is an example
and we think that this example will make clear
the concept that is how gross annual value is determined
from gross annual value, municipal tax is deducted
, when municipal tax is deducted from gross annual value,
we get the net annual value from net annual value
if we see again the steps
this is the case of property held as stock in trade
in case of house property, a portion is let out and
portion is self occupied income from any portion of a property
which is let out shall be computed
separately under the let out property category
and the portion of our part, which is self occupied
shall be computed under the self occupied category
there is no need to treat the whole property as a single unit
for computation of income from house property
municipal valuation, fair rent, standard rent,
the actual rent received or receivable, unrealized rent,
if not given separately shall be apportioned
between the let out portion and self occupied portion
either on plinth area or built up space
or on such other reasonable basis
property taxes or municipal taxes if given
on a consolidated basis can be bifurcated, as attributed to
each portion or floor on a reasonable basis
in many cases, the discussions which we have carried out so far,
the income is taken as a notional income instead of real income
thus under this kind of income
period of months in that particular period it is taken as twelve months for each cases
there are circumstances where notional income is charged
to tax instead of real income
for example, the assessee owns more than one house property
where one house property or two house property or as the case may be,
will be taken as self occupied
and the gross annual value will be taken as nil
other house properties will be taken as deemed to be let out
and their gross annual value will be charged separately as the expected rent
what they expected rent is the notional income,
as in the case of later property also if the expected rent exceeds
and loss due to vacancy are given for five house property
the actual rent, then the expected rent is the gav
and expected rent is of course notional
in case of a house property, as a stock held as a stock in trade
, the income has to be computed on notional basis
by taking the expected rent as the gav after one year,
from the financial year, in which certificate of completion of construction
of the property is given
namely a ,b, c, d, e , in this example, we have taken
a loss due to vacancy as well as unrealized rent
, our purpose is to see how
the gross annual value is calculated when
there are standard rent is present, unrealized rent is there
and also there is a vacancy allowance
, if we see that how it is being determined in step one
step one, we have to find out the reasonable expected rent of the property
we will find out the expected rent,
which is the higher of municipal valuation and fair rent
which shows like this for five house properties a b, c, d, e
step two, we will see rent received after deducting the unrealized rent
, we will deduct the unrealized rent from
the actual rent received and these are the figures
step three ,higher of step one and step two,
and accordingly in case of house a, it is one hundred and eight thousand ,house b one hundred and ten thousand
house c, eighty-nine thousand house d, one hundred and twelve thousand house e, one hundred and eight thousand
step four we have to see lost due to vacancy
step two, find out the rent actually received or receivable
in one st house there is no loss, two nd house two thousand
three rd house three thousand four th house four thousand and five th house there is no loss of vacancy
, gav the gross annual value is step three minus step four
,in case of house one,we see it house one,108000,house b,it is one hundred and eight thousand
house c is eighty-six thousand house d one hundred and eight thousand and house e one hundred and eight thousand
, this example should clear the concept of expected rent,
the rent received after deduction of unrealized rent
and also the treatment of loss due to vacancy
second condition where let out property is vacant for part of the year
that is where let out property is
from here we will deduct the unrealized rent
vacant for part of the year owing to the vacancy,
the actual rent is lower than the expected rent
then the actual rent received or receivable is the gross annual value
but the expected rent and received or receivable
is lower than the year because of the vacancy
then only expected actual rent received or receivable will be the gav
in other cases, if the actual rent received or receivable
is more in that case, it will be taken as the gav
in case of self occupied property or unoccupied property
what is an unoccupied property the expression unoccupied property
but it is before deducting the loss due to vacancy
refers to a property,which cannot be occupied by the owner
by reason of his employment or business or profession at a different place
and he resides in such other place
as in a building not belonging to him, in that case
it the house property will be taken as unoccupied property
, where the property is self-occupied for own residence
or unoccupied throughout the previous year, the annual value
will be taken as nil , provided no other benefit
is derived by the owner from such property
the benefit of exemption of one self occupied house
step three, find out which one is higher
is available only to individual or huf and now this will be to
self occupied house for assessment year two thousand and twenty - twenty-one and no deduction
for municipal taxes is allowed in respect of such property,
whose annual value is taken as nil ,
where a house property is let out for part of the year
and self occupied for part of the year
that is, if a single unit of a property
is self occupied for part of the year
and let out for the remaining part of the year
then the expected rent for the whole year
step four, find out the loss due to vacancy
shall be taken into account for determining the gross annual value
the expected rent of the whole year shall be compared
with the actual rent for the let out period
and whichever is higher shall be taken as gross annual value
however, the municipal tax for the whole year is allowed to be deducted
provided it is paid by the owner during the previous year
in case of deemed to be let out property
it is given under section twenty-three subsection four
that where the assessee owns more than one property,
or two properties as the case may be from assessment year two thousand and twenty - twenty-one
and step five is step three minus step four,and which will actually give us
for self occupation,then the income of
any such property at the option of the assessee
shall be computed self occupied property, and the annual value will be taken as nil
the other self occupied or unoccupied properties
shall be treated as deemed to be let out properties
the option can be changed year after year
in a manner which is beneficial to the assessee
in case of a house property which is held as stock in trade
section twenty-three subsection five deals with this,
the gross annual value let us take one example,
that in some cases, property consisting of any building
or land appurtenant thereto may be held a stock in trade
and the whole or any part of the property may not be let out during the
whole or any part of the previous year
in such cases, the annual value of such property
or part of the property shall be taken as nil
the benefit would be available for the period up to one year
from the end of the financial year,
in which certificate of completion of construction of the property
is obtained from the competent authority
where the municipal valuation, the fair rent,the standard rent,
let's see the treatment of unrealized rent
for the amount which he could not collect from the tenant
he has to satisfy four conditions number one,it is to be proved that
the tenancy is bona fide that is the agreement between the landlord
and the tenant was made in good faith number two,
the defaulting tenant has vacated, the property or steps have been
taken to compel him to vacant the property number three,
the defaulting tenant is not has vacated the property as well as
is not in occupation of any other property of the assessee
and fourthly, the assessee has taken all reasonable steps
to institute legal proceedings for the recovery of the unpaid rent,
it is an addition to the explanation given under section twenty-three subsection one
or satisfies the assessing officer that the legal proceedings would be useless,
and it means that throwing good money for bad money
, let's see about the property taxes, municipal taxes
which is allowed as a deduction from gross annual value
property taxes are allowable as deduction from the gross annual value
subject to two conditions, number one, it must be borne by
the assessee or the owner if it is borne by the tenant,
then it cannot be claimed as deduction from the gross annual value
and number two, it should be paid during the previous year
, the municipal taxes are allowed on the basis on the payment basis
the amount of rent received or receivable
, if the property taxes levied by a local authority
for a particular previous year is not paid during the year,
no deduction shall be allowed but if the payment is made
for the past years, that is the area taxes or if it is paid for the
future years that is advance, payment of tax
all these are deductible provide on the basis of the payment
, in case of property situated outside india,
taxes levied by local authority of the country
in which the property is situated is deductible
, this is the municipal tax, which is deductible on payment basis
should not include any amount of rent, which is not capable of being realized
and the payment must be made by the owner
and the expenses of the taxes is to be borne by the owner
then only it can be deducted from gross annual value
, there are certain deductions general deductions,
like in case of salaries, we have seen this section sixteen
in case of house property, it is section twenty-four
there was reforms in house property income earlier the list was long enough,
but now, there are only two items, which are there
under section twenty-four number one standard deduction
and number two interest on borrowed capital
as we say that in case of bad debt, which is a deductible
regarding standard deduction,
there is a flat deduction and is allowed irrespective
of the expenditure incurred earlier before reforms,
ground rent,collection charges, etc the list was long enough,
which the assessee used to claim but now there is no such other deductions,
a standard deduction is given and the assesseewill be
ours is given thirty percent of the net annual value as a reduction
but this deduction is not available in case of self occupied property
or in case of any property held stock in trade
which is not let out during the whole or any part of the year up
expense under section thirty-seven of the income tax act
to one year from the end of the financial year
,this is something about the standard deduction,
which is thirty percent of the net annual value
, let us see the interest on borrowed capital
interest on borrowed capital is allowed
as a deduction under section twenty-four subsection b
interest payable on loans borrowed for the purpose of acquisition,
construction, repairs, renewal
or reconstruction can be claimed as a deduction interest payable on
fresh loan taken to repay the original loan raised earlier
unrealized rent is also deductible
for the aforesaid purposes is also
allowed or admissible as a deduction
there is a concept of pre construction period interest
normally loan is taken and the interest is payable
during the construction period also, when the property is not
available for any income, the property is not ready for earning income
, for the pre construction period, that is the period
prior to the previous year in which the property is acquired or
construction is completed interest payable on borrowed
capital for the period prior to the previous year
provided certain conditions as prescribed in rule four are satisfied
in which the property has been acquired or constructed,
that is the pre-construction period interest can be claimed as deduction
over a period of five years in equal annual installments,
commencing from the year of acquisition or completion of construction
, interest for the year in which the construction is completed,
that is the interest relating to the year of completion of
construction can be fully claimed in that year
irrespective of the date of completion, but in case of
pre construction period, it is one fifth that is
for a period of five years, it can be deducted in equal annual installments
, what are the conditions that when an assessee
wishes to claim deduction for unrealized rent
, in case of deduction in respect of
deduction at the rate of thirty percent under standard deduction is allowable
and it is taxable even if the assessee is not the owner of
the property in the financial year of received or realization
there is a confusion regarding co-owned property
section 26,makes ample try to make it clear to the assessees
that where the property is owned by two or more person
and whose shares are definite and ascertainable than, the income from
such property cannot be taxed as income of an aop
the share of income of each of co owner is determined in accordance with
section twenty-two to twenty-five and is included in the individual assessment
acquisition or construction, the maximum limit is rupees two lakhs
in case of flats where the house property is owned by co owners,
and its self occupied by each of the co-owners,
the annual value of each of the co-owner will be nil
and each co-owner shall be entitled to a deduction of
rupees thirty thousand or rupees two lakhs,
as the case may be under section twenty-four subsection b
on account of interest on borrowed capital
and where the house property owned by the co-owner is let out
and the income from such property shall be computed
as if the property is owned by one owner
if a certificate is also produced, but if the loan is taken ,
and thereafter the income,so computed shall be
apportioned among each co owner as per, the specific share
section twenty-seven of the act talks about the deemed ownership
, as per section twenty-seven the persons though not legal owners
of a property are deemed to be the owners of for the purpose of
section twenty-two to section twenty-six like transfer to a spouse
transfer to a minor child, holder of an impartible estate,
member of a cooperative society,person in possession of
a property, though not a legal owner and person having right
in a property for a period of less than twelve years will be taken as
even if after one thousand, four hundred and ninety-nine for the purpose of repair, renewal,
the deemed owner but however, in case of person having right
in a property for less than twelve years,
in case of the person acquiring the rights,by way of lease from month to month
or for a period of not exceeding one year
such person will not be treated as legal owner
as we have told you that we are learning these things
for accurate tax calculations
as well as to save some amount of tax
let's see there are certain tax planning hints
like prior to financial year two thousand and nineteen - twenty
construction, reconstruction etc
if more than one self occupied household is owned by the taxpayer,
only one house is considered and treated as a self occupied property
and the remaining house are to be taken to be let out
the choice of the property to choose as self occupied
is up to the tax payerand from the assessment year two thousand and nineteen - twenty onwards
the benefit of considering the house as self occupied
has been extended to two houses
, an assessee can claim
his two properties of self occupied and remaining
as let out for income tax purposes
then the maximum amount of interest that can be claimed is rupees thirty thousand only
if the interest is paid out of india, tax is to be deducted
, be careful when pay interest paid out of india
municipal taxes is paid on payment basis
, try to pay the municipal tax and claim the deduction on the year of payment
interest payable on outstanding installments
it may be claimed as deduction under section twenty-four
even if it is not paid
, the rupees two lakhs is the enhanced amount of
deduction that can be claimed
under interest on borrowed capital if the loan is taken
after one thousand, four hundred and ninety-nine and the property is that is the loan is taken for
acquisition or construction for the purpose of
one self occupied property where the annual value is taken as nil
claiming deduction for rupees two lakhs, the assessee should furnish
a certificate from the person to whom any interest is payable
on the capital borrowed specifying the amount of
interest payable by the assessee for the purpose of such acquisition
or construction of the property
, there is the ceiling of rupees thirty thousand or rupees two lakhs,
this does not apply to the let out or deemed to be let out property,
then is the ceiling prescribed for the self occupied property
is not applicable to deemed to be let out property
or let out property that in those cases, there is no limit
or the two self occupied property from the assessment year two thousand and twenty - twenty-one
interest is allowable on accrual basis not on payment basis
that is deduction under section twenty-four (b)
for interest is available on an accrual basis
if benefit is not paid, it can be claimed as deduction
an unpaid purchase price would also be considered as
capital borrowed and interest paid on unpaid interest is not deductible
, these are the some of the issues in case of
interest on borrowed capital if we see the deductions
from income from house property, we can see it under two categories
one is for the let out property
the assessee will be allowed a deduction on account of interest
and the other is for the self occupied property property
for let out property, there are two deduction,
standard deduction under section twenty-four subsection a
which is thirty percent of the net gross annual value
and for interest on borrowed capital,
there is no limit if the house is let out or deemed to be let out
for self occupied property, we have to see
if the house is purchased before one - four - one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine
or after one - four - one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine in case a house is self occupied
and the loan is taken for reconstruction, repair ,renewals etc
including one fifth of the accumulated interest of the pre-construction period
the maximum limit is rupees thirty thousand if the house is taken for construction
for acquisition, then we have to see whether the loan is taken
before one - four - one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine or after one - four - one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine if the loan is taken before one - four - one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine
then it is thirty thousand but if it is taken after one - four - one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine
in that case, the loan that is the interest can be claimed up to rupees two lakhs
, let's see the computation of income from house property
for a let out property from our earlier discussion if we again
recapitulate the discussion ,step one, we have to compute the expected rent
expected rent is the higher of municipal valuation and fair rent,
but it is restricted to standard rent
under two categories, number one,
step two, let us compute the actual rent received or receivable
from here we will deduct unrealized rent if any
step three is the gross annual value, which is the higher of expected rent
and actual rent received or receivable
if the actual rent received is less than the expected rent because of
vacancy, then ar is the gross annual value
but if actual rent is less than expected rent because of some other reason,
then expected rent will be the gross annual value
step three, the gross annual value is the higher of expected rent or actual rent
step four, we have to deduct municipal tax,
if the loan borrowed before loan is borrowed, before one thousand, four hundred and ninety-nine
then we get the net annual value
step six, we deduct deductions under section twenty-four ( 1)
, there are two deductions as we have already discussed
standard deduction which is thirty percent of the net annual value
and interest on borrowed capital
these two are deducted from net annual value and step seven, we get
the income from house property self occupied property or
unoccupied property, here the annual value is taken as nil
, here only deduction under section twenty-four ( 1),
there is only one deduction, interest on borrowed capital is given
then the maximum amount of interest that can be taken as deduction is rupees thirty thousand
and as we have already told that if it is the loan is taken for
repair ,renewals, reconstruction etc the maximum interest is
a restricted to rs thirty thousand but if it is taken for
construction or purchase of the house acquisition of the house
and if the loan is taken prior to one - four - one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine ,maximum is rs thirty thousand
but if it is taken after one - four - one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine in that case,
it is rupees two lakhs will be the maximum amount
but provided the construction is completed within the five years
from the end of the financial year in which the capital was borrowed
section twenty-five talks about certain inadmissible deductions
if the loan is borrowed on or after one thousand, four hundred and ninety-nine
that is interest chargeable under this act
which is payable outside india shall not be deducted if
tax has not been paid or deducted from such interest
and there is no such person in india
who may be treated as an agent
in that case, the interest cannot be taken as deduction
there is a provision for arrearsof rent
and unrealized rent received subsequently,
section twenty-five subsection a so, if unrealized rent or any arrear is received,
it is taxable in the year of receipt/realization
the actual amount payable and it is for the purpose of
let us discuss one comprehensive problem
higher is three hundred and fifty thousand but a standard rent is applicable here
it cannot exceed standard rent, but in this case standard rent is five lakhs,
which is much much higher than the higher of
fair rent and municipal valuation
,out of three hundred and twenty thousand and three hundred and fifty thousand the higher
three hundred and fifty thousand will be the expected rent of the property
step two we have to see the rent received or receivable
after deducting unrealized rent, but before adjusting loss due to vacancy
, here we have seen that rent received by
in case of house two is four hundred and twenty thousand
the houses were vacant for certain period of months
an unrealized rent for the previous year is deductible it is eighty thousand
, four hundred and twenty thousand minus eighty thousand we get three hundred and forty thousand
step three ,will be amount computed in step one and step two whichever is higher
, out of three hundred and fifty thousand and three hundred and forty thousand
higher is three hundred and fifty thousand , we deduct the loss due to vacancy
loss due to vacancy here it is clearly given as rupees one hundred and forty thousand
, we deduct loss due to vacancy one hundred and forty thousand
, in step five we get gross annual value for house two
in step three minus step four two hundred and ten thousand
from here we have to deduct the municipal tax
during the previous year house one was vacant for two months,
which is paid by the landlord and also borne by the landlord
it is deducted on payment basis
, fifty thousand is deducted we get the net annual value as one hundred and sixty thousand
from net annual value there are deductions available under section twenty-four
two deductions number one,standard deduction that is thirty percent of the net annual value
that is thirty percent of one hundred and sixty thousand it is forty-eight thousand
and interest on borrowed capital as the borrowed capital is
taken for the construction of house two
, it is allowable for house two
, it is one hundred and forty thousand ,in one hundred and forty thousand total is
house two for four months ,he has shown the
one hundred and eighty-eight thousand we deduct from one hundred and sixty thousand which is the net value
net annual value , that deductions are more in that case
we will get a negative income from house two,
house two income from house two will be minus twenty-eight thousand
if we calculate the gross total income of mr a
, income from house property, house one
is 3,15,000,house two is minus twenty-eight thousand his income from
house property comes at two hundred and seventy-eight thousand his business income
or income from profits and gains of business or profession is one million, eighty-two thousand
ultimately, we get the gross total income as one million, three hundred and sixty-nine thousand
calculation on loss of account of vacancy
municipal taxes paid,then repairs, insurance,
land revenue, ground rent, etc
interest on borrowed capital by a mortgage house
he has mortgage house number one
direct_tax_2317
and interest on borrowed capital the funds are used for
of income from house property
construction of house number two it's one hundred and forty thousand
and the nature of occupation is the house one is
for let out residents house two is let out for business
we have to determine the gross total income
of mr a for the assessment year two thousand and eighteen - nineteen
just have a look on the figures again
,let us see the solutions to the problem
first house one to calculate the gross annual value
we first have to know the reasonable expected rent of the property
for the assessment year two thousand and eighteen - nineteen mr a submits
, step one we have to find out the reasonable
expected rent of the property, what is the higher of
municipal value or fair rent?
but if standard rent is there,
then it would be restricted to standard rent
, if we see, in case of house one
fair rent is three hundred and fifty thousand municipal value is three hundred and sixty thousand
while standard rent is three lakh
, higher of fair rent and municipal valuation is three hundred and sixty thousand
but a standard rent is three lakhs
the following information, his income from business
, the reasonable expected rental property will be three lakhs
in step two, we will see the rent received and receivable
after deducting unrealized rent, but before adjusting the loss of vacancy,
if we see in case of house one, the rent is six lakhs rupees
and the unrealized rent is ten thousand ,
when we deduct ten thousand from six lakhs, we get five hundred and ninety thousand
while deducting unrealized rent we presume that
all conditions that are necessary for getting these deductions are satisfied
, these conditions, we should know that
the tenancy was bonafide,
is rupees one million, eighty-two thousand and he gives details of his property income
the owner has put all efforts to collect the money
the tenant has vacated the property and the tenant has
not in occupation of any other property of the owner
, if such conditions are fulfilled,then unrealized rent can be deducted
in this case, we presume all these conditions are satisfied
step three, the amount computed in step one and step two, whichever is higher
so, out of three lakh and five lakh ninty thousand ,
five lakh ninty thousand is higher
, from here if there is a vacancy loss
we will deduct it in this case there is a loss of one lakh rupees,
he has two houses house one and house two
,we deduct one lakh from five lakh ninty thousand
, we get four lakh ninty thousand, which is the gross annual value
of house one we think that you should have a fairly good idea
for calculation of gross annual value when unrealized rent as well as
vacancy loss are there ,
once we have calculated the gross annual value,
that we deduct the municipal tax,
municipal tax here given is forty thousand
one condition to be remembered in case of deduction of municipal tax that it is
deductible on payment basis not on due basis
he has given the details of fair rent
if the municipal tax is paid in the year in which it is paid
in that year it is eligible for deduction
it may be paid in advance it will be paid for past years
but the condition is that it must be paid and secondly
the it must be borne by the landlord, if it is borne by the
tenant then the deduction is not available
, when we deduct municipal tax from gross annual value,
we get net annual value , there are general deductions
under section twenty-four which are available
in the head income from house property
municipal valuation,standard rent actual rent,
there are two deductions available under section twenty-four
one is standard deduction,which is thirty percent of rupees four hundred and fifty thousand
, the rule is thirty percent of the net annual value
, here thirty percent of rupees four hundred and fifty thousand is one hundred and thirty-five thousand
another deduction under section twenty-four is interest on borrowed capital
here, mr a has borrowed funds on the mortgage of house one
but he has used the loan for construction of house number two,
, this reduction is not available for
house number one simply because the house number one was mortgaged for the loan
, the interest deductible here
unrealized rent of the previous year two thousand and seventeen - eighteen
for house number one is nil , total deduction under section twenty-four
is one hundred and thirty-five thousand , when you deduct this one hundred and thirty-five thousand
from net annual value four hundred and fifty thousand we get income from house one as three hundred and fifteen thousand
, let us see the calculation for house two
we have to calculate the gross annual value
,for calculation of gross annual value, we will go
step one, step two,step three, step four, step five like this
step one, we have to find out the reasonable expected rent of the property
which is fair rent or municipal value whichever is higher
in this case fair rent is three hundred and twenty thousand municipal valuation is three hundred and fifty thousand
unrealized rent of the previous year two thousand and sixteen - seventeen
computation of depreciation is dependent on certain factors
and, number one, it is the block of assets,number two
written down value ,number three actual cost
depreciation is available in case of intangible assets
according to the 'straight line method', while in case of other assets,
it is on the written down value method
what are the block of assets? block of assets has got different groups,
tangible assets being building ,machinery, plant or furniture,
intangible assets being know how, patents ,copyrights, trademarks, licenses
franchises etc income tax act provides
requiring some degree of learning
different depreciation rates for different block off assets like building
if it is residential building the depreciation rate is five percent
if building is used in office or factory, it is ten %,
if building is the temporary erection etc it is forty percent
it is block one, block two, block three in case of block four
furniture including electric fittings, the normal rate is ten percent
and in case of plant and machinery, the general rate is fifteen percent
but plant and machinery in case of ocean going ships is twenty percent
plant and machinery in case of buses lorries etc is thirty percent
plant and machinery in case of aeroplanes or computers it is forty percent
the term profession includes vocation as well
and the block nine deals with the intangible assets
where the general repreciation rate is twenty-five percent
then we have to see the computation of written down value
we can take an example of computation of written down value of an asset
for the assessment year two thousand and eighteen - nineteen step one, were have to find out
the depreciated value of the block on april one two thousand and seventeen
step two, where to add the actual cost of the assets, which are
acquired during the previous year in during that particular year two thousand and seventeen - eighteen
and step three, we had to deduct the money received or receivable
in respect of the asset which is sold, discarded,
as defined in section two subsection thirty-six
demolished or destroyed during the previous year
like a painter, a sculptor, an author,
a chartered accountant or auditor, a lawyer,
a doctor, an architect, or even an astrologer
are the persons who can be said to be carrying on
a profession, but not the business
however, it is not material whether a person is carrying a business
or profession or vocation since, for the purpose of assessment,
welcome learners, this week we will learnt a very important head
profits are income of all these sources, are treated and taxed
alike besides necessarily means
a continuous exercise of activity,
nevertheless, profits from a single venture
in the nature of trade may also be treated as business
, the term profits when we talk about in
profits and gains of business and profession
the profits includes any income earned in cash or in kind ,
capital receipts or it may be involuntary receipts
its application of the gains
of income, that is profits and gains of business and profession
in the trade whether it is immaterial and the
income tax act also does not consider about the
legality or illegality of the income even income earned
from illegal business is subject to tax
an income from distinguished businesses are also taxed in separately
and ultimately we get the computation of profits
in case of method of accounting, there is a tax accounting standard
and icds, that stands for income disclosure and tax accounting standards
section twenty-eight of the income tax act
discusses the income chargeable under this head,
it is known as pgbp the meaning of business and
and it includes income from business, profession or vocation,
any compensation or any other payment due to or received by the assessee,

and value of any benefit or perquisite
or any sum due to or received by a partner of a firm
which is chargeable under this head,
any sum received under keyman insurance policy
sum received on a acount of capital asset referred
to under section thirty-five ad or any sum,
whether received or receivable
in cash or in kind under an agreement
, while discussing the income for business or profession
there is a term called speculative business
the term business has been defined in section two subsection thirteen
, speculative business means,
a transaction in which a contract for the purchases
or sales of any commodity including stock and shares,
is periodically or ultimately settled

transactions not deemed to be speculative transactions include
hedging contract in respect of raw materials, or merchandise
hedging contracts in respect of stock and shares,
and which includeany trade, commerce or manufacture
forward contract, trading in derivatives, trading in commodity derivatives, etc
, let's see the computation of income from business
section twenty-nine deals in a computation of income from
business or profession while, section thirty to thirty-seven
deals with admissible deductions
section forty deals with inadmissible deductions
section forty a deals with expenses or payments, not deductible
on certain circumstances section forty-one deals with profits chargeable to tax
and there are certain other provisions
, section thirty-two to section thirty-seven deals with admissible deductions
or any adventure or concern in the nature of trade,
like section thirty deals with rent, rates, repairs,
insurance for buildings, section thirty-one
repairs and insurance of machinery, plant and furniture
section thirty-two deals with depreciation,section thirty-two ad
deals with manufacturing industries set up in notified backward areas
of specified states that are eligible for a deduction
at the rate of fifteen percent of the actual cost of new plant and machinery
acquired and installed during the previous year
before we go for other sections, section thirty-two needs to be elaborately discussed
section thirty-two deals with depreciation
commerce or manufacture while the term profession
, there are certain conditions for claiming depreciation
depreciation is a very important deduction for income from business or profession
number one condition says that the asset must be owned by the assessee
if the asset is not owned by the assessee
if it is taken on lease or some other agreement
it will not qualify for deduction for depreciation
then it must be used for the purpose of business or profession
it should be used during the relevant previous year
and depreciation is available on tangible as well as intangible goods
has not been defined in the act, but it means an occupation
let us discuss a problem on depreciation
of three buildings with cost during the year seven hundred and twenty-eight thousand, seven hundred
and there is a sale of building l with six hundred thousand
,the written down value on march thirty-one is eight hundred and thirty-eight thousand, nine hundred
block c with building rate of depreciation at the rate of forty percent
, the depreciated value we get at one million, six hundred and ninety thousand
block seven we have furniture rate of depreciation with ten percent
and there is a new cost that is which is being purchased at fifty-six thousand
, total written down value is fifty-six thousand
and then the block eight with the copyright rate of depreciation with twenty-five percent
and there was no opening balance, but we had a
is rupees one million, two hundred and forty thousand two nd block of plant again,
purchase this time one million, seven hundred and fifty thousand written down value is one million, seven hundred and fifty thousand
but there are two plants now d and e,
but this falls under the group of forty percent depreciation
as a depreciated value of two hundred and sixty thousand
plant f is the third block as the rate of depreciation is thirty percent
and the opening balance is seventy thousand
,we have got three blocks of building building a, b, c and d,
which fall in ten percent depreciation rate
we have a opening balance of one million, ninety thousand, six hundred
another block of building e ,f, g, that is five percent block
compute the written down value
and the depreciated value on the beginning of the year is seven hundred and ten thousand, two hundred
and the last one is building h,i, j and k,
which comes under forty percent depreciation and opening value for one million, six hundred and ninety thousand
, after the april one two thousand and seventeen
the company purchases certain assets
and accordingly the assets are categorized
as per rate of depreciation
first one they had purchased plant g the date of purchase is
given as april six two thousand and seventeen ,rate of depreciation is thirty percent
at a cost of six thousand plant h is purchased on may eleven two thousand and seventeen
from the following information for the assessment year two thousand and eighteen - nineteen
rate of depreciation fifteen percent amount is eighteen thousand
furniture on june six 2017,rate of depreciation ten percent
actual cost fifty-six thousand car july seven two thousand and seventeen rate of depreciation fifteen percent
actual cost is two hundred and fifty-six thousand then there is a building l,
it is purchased on september twenty-six two thousand and seventeen
with a rate of depreciation five percent it is cost at seven hundred and twenty thousand, seven hundred
computer september twenty-seven two thousand and seventeen rate of depreciation is forty percent
actual cost is ninety thousand copyright september thirty two thousand and seventeen
rate of depreciation twenty-five percent and actual cost is one million, seven hundred and fifty thousand
during the year, some assets are transferred
we have block of assets,
, this list is also given plant b which was originally there
it was sold on december two hundred and two thousand and seventeen at a price of two million, five hundred and ten thousand, nine hundred
plan dwas also sold on january thirty-one two thousand and eighteen
at a consideration of twelve thousand building l
was sold on march six two thousand and eighteen at a sale consideration of
rupees six lakhs ,these are the information
which are given and this is an idea
by which the written down value of assets can be calculated
first we need the opening balance of different assets
as per block we categorize as per
six block of assets, the rate of depreciation,
nature of the asset as well as the rate of depreciation
and also we need the details of purchases during the year
which we have already got and the list of the assets which are transferred
during the year which we have also received
, let's see the solution how it can be
calculated ?ultimately how can we calculate the written down value
of assets for different blocks
, we have to calculate as per block wise
we will first see plant and machinery
the block which had the depreciation rate of fifteen percent
percent as well as depreciation value on april one two thousand and seventeen are given
,block one plant and machinery rate of depreciation fifteen percent
here there are three plants a, b and c
we take the depreciated value
as per the book for a,b,c the aggregate value is one million, two hundred and forty thousand
during the year same rate of depreciation of fifteen percent
plant h was purchased and car was also purchased
at the same rate of depreciation
, car also falls under the group block plant
, total purchase is two hundred and seventy-four thousand
, when we add two hundred and seventy-four thousand with one million, two hundred and forty thousand
, if we see the table
we get one million, five hundred and fourteen thousand
then the sale consideration let's see in fifteen percent block
or which are the assets which are being sold,
we had plant a, plan b ,plan c
plant h and the car in this particular block
out of this we have seen plan b is sold at twenty-five lakh
sale consideration of plant b
and it is sold at two million, five hundred and ten thousand, nine hundred
,sale proceeds of plant b is more than that of the
calculated value, which we have one million, five hundred and fourteen thousand and that's why
there is a group of plant a, b and c
the amount deducted will be restricted to one million, five hundred and fourteen thousand
it cannot be more than that ,the written down value
of block one will be nil same to same in case of block two
it is plant and machinery with rate of depreciation of forty percent
here we get two plants d and e opening balance was two hundred and sixty thousand
during the year a cost of computer was purchased on the same
depreciation rate ninety thousand and plant b was sold at twelve thousand rupees
, the written down value at the end of the year is
three hundred and thirty-eight thousand there another plant of machinery
with thirty percent rate of depreciation
which falls under same rate of depreciation fifteen percent
, you get the total value of the block
on the plant a was there it is seventy thousand
with this we add the cost of plan g have been the same rate of depreciation six thousand
, written down value at the end seventy-six thousand there was no sale
from this particular block block- four building with depreciated value,
we have four buildings here a b, c and d
with one million, ninety thousand, six hundred and actually there are no addition
or no selling also one million, ninety thousand, six hundred is the written down value
block five are building with rate of depreciation of five percent
, here we got seven hundred and ten thousand as the depreciated value
and the total depreciated value on april one two thousand and seventeen
there are various admissible deductions we can continue with this,
weighted deduction in respect of expenditure incurred on
notified agricultural extension project,
weighted deduction in respect of expenditure incurred by companies
on notified skill development project then amortisation of
preliminary expenses under section thirty-five d,
amortisation expenditure incurred under voluntary retirement scheme
and also, section thirty-six has other deductions which include insurance premium
insurance premiums paid by the employer on health insurance of employees,
bonus and commission, interest on borrowed capital,
discount on zero coupon bonds etc
that is expenditure on scientific research
the other deduction list is also long enough
it's contribution to the provident fund and other funds,
employer's contribution to on account of employee under pension scheme
allowances for animal or bad debts, then expenses on family planning etc
the list is long enough under this section
then section thirty-seven deals with all or residuary expenses
if the assessee can prove that any expenses is incurred
for the business or for the furtherance of business
in that case he can claim deduction under section thirty-seven
under section thirty-five and we can see the explanations under section thirty-five
, the companies act two thousand and thirteen has made it compulsory for spending of csr
by certain categories of companies
, section explanation two to section thirty-seven ( 1)
discusses about allowances and dis-allowances of expenditures on csr
section forty of the income tax act deals with
inadmissible deductions, certain payments or certain expenses are not deductible
in certain circumstances under section forty a
like payment to relatives or associates,
cash payment in excess of rupees ten thousand
which is nowadays is discouraged very much,
of the expenditure which is incurred for scientific research
disallowance of provision for gratuity,
contribution by employers to funds, trust etc under section forty a
then profits chargeable to tax under section forty-one
it includes remission or cessation of trading liability,
balancing charge, sale of capital asset used for scientific research,
recovery of bad debt, etc withdrawal from reserves created,
brought forward loss etc another important aspect
in this particular chapter is for compulsory maintenance of accounts,
which is elaborately discussed under section forty-four aa,
of the act that maintenance of books of accounts and other documents
and which goes as high as one hundred and fifty percent of the expenses,
by notified professionals, maintenance of
books of accounts and other documents if the income
turnover income or turnover or gross receipts exceeds the prescribed limit
in that case, the assessee is under compulsion
for maintenance of books of accounts and the audit of
books of accounts of certain persons are also compulsory under section forty-four ab
, it is obligatory on for a person or carrying on business or profession
to get his accounts audited before the specified date
by a chartered accountant if the total sales turnover
or gross receipts of the business exceeds rupees one crore
which are incurred on scientific research
or hundred lakhs in any previous year for a business
and in case of a profession, the gross receipts exceeds rupees fifty lakhs
section forty-four ad makes provision for
computing of profits and gains of business or profession
on presumptive basis for small businesses
the presumptive taxation under section forty-four ad
covers all small business with total turnover gross receipts
up to rupees two hundred lakhs that is rupees two crore
except the business of plying, hiring or leasing goods carriages,
covered under section forty-four ae, but for all other
music
businesses small businesses up to rupees two crore turnover
they can take advantage of presumptive tax under section forty-four ad
and the payment of tax is very simple, the presumptive rate of
tax is eight percent of the total turnover or gross receipts
, we can see the proforma for computation of profits and gains
of business or profession the base is the profits,
net profit as calculated under the profit and loss account
which is normally prepared by any business house
we this we will add expenses which are debited to profit and loss account,
but which are not allowable under the income tax act
continue with this admissible deduction from section thirty-two to thirty-seven
, there are various expenses including
the depreciation which a company charges
because depreciation is calculated under section thirty-two of the income tax act
, the expenses which are shown in the profit and loss account
which are not allowable are added back
same way the expenditures which are allowable as reduction,
but not debited to profit and loss account is also deducted
which includes again the depreciation which is
calculated as per provisions same to same with some investment allowable etc
then we will also deduct any income
there is investment linked tax incentives under section thirty-five ad
which is credited to profit and loss account, but not taxable
under any other head those expenses are also deducted
and in case of any deemed income, those incomes are added back
when we do all these four adjustments, ultimately we get
the profit and gains of business and profession
contribution for rural development thirty-five cca,
let us see a comprehensive problem
where the amount of depreciation allowable is thirty-seven thousand, three hundred
and it includes depreciation on permanent sign board
there are certain other information that advertisement expenditure includes
rupees three thousand being cost of permanent sign board,
income of four thousand, five hundred accrued during the previous year
is not recorded in the profit and loss account
mr a pays rupees six thousand as premium on life insurance policy
general expenses include rupees five hundred given to mr a
for arranging a party in honor of a friend who has recently come from
germany rupees one thousand being contribution to political party
that is how to calculate profits and gains of business or profession
loan was taken from mrs a for payment of arrears of income tax
, these are some of the information which are given and from there,
it is interesting to calculate
the profits and gains from business and profession
let's see the solution, how do we do
our base is net profit as per our profit and loss account,
which shows two hundred and fifty thousand
, the expenses which are shown here
in the profit and loss account, some of the expenses
will not be allowed that would be added back to this profit
from the profit and loss account of an entrepreneur
, let us see the adjustments the add back of
those items number one, expenses for arranging personal property not allowed,
contribution to political party not allowed at this moment,
but they can also take advantage from other sections
advanced tax, it will be deducted from tax payable afterwards
salary to mr a interest on capital to mr a,
interest on loan taken for payment of interest,
capital expenditure on advertisement
then there is excess depreciation,there are two ways depreciation could have been
added back and then the income tax
the profit and loss account of mr a for the year ending march thirty-one two thousand and eighteen
allowed depreciation could have been deducted or otherwise
we are doing it as excess depreciation there is forty-eight thousand minus thirty-seven thousand, three hundred
ten thousand, seven hundred we are adding back
income not recorded in the profit and loss on four thousand, five hundred
, from here we will deduct
some of the incomes which were shown
in the profit and loss account, but it should not come under the head,
business and profession , this would be deducted
interest on debenture and interest on company deposits
, when we deduct it we get
from this, we're to ascertain the total income
the income for business and profession as three hundred and fifty thousand, three hundred
we can also compute the net income of mr a
as profits and gains of business and profits we are getting
three hundred and fifty thousand, three hundred income from other sources
which includes interest on debenture, and company deposit thirty-eight thousand
,gross total income is three hundred and eighty-eight thousand, three hundred is an individual
, he will claim deduction under section eighty c
like payment of insurance six thousand payment of at eighty ggc,
where he has made a contribution to political party of one thousand
he can deduct this and his net
and tax liability for the assessment year two thousand and eighteen - nineteen
income we can calculate at three hundred and eighty-one thousand, three hundred
the profit and loss account is shown
, the profit and loss account shows the net profit of two hundred and fifty thousand, six hundred
and there are certain other information,
hello learners,
, these are the five cases which we have seen
, let's see question number three
mr p shared the following information
number one car acquired by him in march two thousand and eleven for rs one hundred thousand
was sold on fifth december two thousand and eighteen for rs forty-five thousand
written down value of the block on one four two thousand and eighteen was rs twenty-five thousand
, here the important term which you have to see is written down value
that means car is the depreciable asset
ornaments costing rs one hundred and fifty thousand which was acquired
in august two thousand and fifteen was sold for rs two hundred thousand in october two thousand and eighteen was
in the hands of mr sharma?
purchased in two thousand and fifteen
self cultivated land in an urban area
was sold for rs one million, five hundred thousand on four one two thousand and nineteen
and its cost in two thousand and two - three was rs two hundred and sixty thousand
he purchased a new piece of land for his own cultivation
for rs three hundred and fifty thousand in june two thousand and nineteen
, he has immediately he purchased
a new piece of land this is also important for us
house at mumbai let out for residential purpose
it was inherited by him in 1964: sale price is two million, two hundred and seventy thousand
the question see a piece of land
fair market value on one four two thousand and one is six lakhs
cost of improvement made during two thousand and nine - ten rs one hundred and fifty thousand
expenses of transfer rs twenty-five thousand
this is one comprehensive example
house hold furnitures costing rs forty thousand in two thousand and two was sold
in march two thousand and nineteen for rs fifty thousand
, from the above particulars,
we have to compute his total capital gain assuming that he has
no other income other than the mentioned above
let's see one by one :car
then that date is also important may two thousand and four
as you know it is a depreciable asset,
even though it is held for more than thirty-six months,
but it is always will be short term capital gains
forty-five thousand minus twenty-five thousand is twenty thousand
ornaments two lakh, it is also short term capital asset
less cost one hundred and fifty thousand so fifty thousand is the benefit
, seventy thousand is the total short term capital gain
let's see long term capital gain,residential house two million, two hundred and seventy thousand
as it is held for more than thirty-six months
, it will be qualify for indexed cost of acquisition,
which is sold for ninety-five thousand
cost of acquisition was six hundred thousand into two hundred and eighty the
current cii divided by one hundred the cii of two thousand and one - two that is one hundred
one million, six hundred and eighty thousand is the inflated cost of cost
cost of improvement same case two hundred and eighty divided by the year in which the
improvement took place that year cii one hundred and forty-eight
, one hundred and fifty thousand into two hundred and eighty divided by one hundred and forty-eight is two hundred and eighty-three thousand, seven hundred and eighty-four
transfer expenses is twenty-five thousand
, total is one million, nine hundred and eighty-eight thousand, seven hundred and eighty-four when you deduct it from the sales
consideration two hundred and eighty-one thousand, two hundred and sixteen is the long term capital asset,
long term capital gain
and this land which is purchased at rs ninety-five thousand in may two thousand and four
next comes so we have got the total and this is the
long term capital gain two hundred and eighty-one thousand sale consideration for
self cultivated land is also taxable fifteen lakhs
indexed cost of acquisition as it qualifies for long term
capital as two hundred and eighty divided by one hundred and five six hundred and ninety-three thousand, three hundred and thirty-four
, capital gain is eight hundred and six thousand, six hundred and sixty-six
but here he can claim exemption under section fifty-four b
as he has immediately purchased another land
, three hundred and fifty thousand is deductible so, the balance four hundred and fifty-six thousand, six hundred and sixty-six is taxable
, total long term capital gain is seven hundred and thirty-seven thousand, eight hundred and eighty-two and when we add up
and he sold in april two thousand and seventeen for rupees one million, one hundred and fifty thousand
with the seventy thousand so total capital gain is eight hundred and seven thousand, eight hundred and eighty-two
, this is a comprehensive problem gives you an idea,
household furniture is not a capital asset,
hence its gain or loss is not taxable
and section fifty-four b, where the assessee claims
and income deduction of three hundred and fifty thousand
includes the amount invested in new agricultural land
, this idea gives you a fairly comprehensive view
of the capital gains taxation
next, see question number four r shares
he sold in two thousand and seventeen which he was purchased in two thousand and four
the following information for the previous year ending on
march thirty-one two thousand and eighteen
, he has got twelve thousand, three hundred and forty-five kinds of assets
shares, date of sale is ten th april two thousand and seventeen
for rs four hundred and fifty thousand which he acquired
for rs one hundred and seventy thousand in two thousand and three - four and the fair market
value on one st april two thousand and eighteen is one hundred and sixty thousand
agricultural land in rural area
outside municipal taxes specifically mentioned
, it was sold in twenty-five th of may two thousand and seventeen for rs twenty-five lakhs cost is two hundred and fifty thousand
, he held the asset for more than thirty-six months or three years
year of purchases eighty-three - eighty-four
agricultural land in urban area
ten th june two thousand and seventeen he sold for seventy-one lakhs
was purchased for seven lakhs in the year two thousand and six - seven
fair market value on one four two thousand and eighteen is three hundred and sixty thousand
debentures is sold on ten th april two thousand and seventeen
for rupees five lakhs, which was purchased for rs two hundred and fifty thousand
in two thousand and three - four and the fair market value was rs two lakhs
personal car which is sold on first july two thousand and seventeen for rupees one lakh
at a cost of rs sixty thousand in the year two thousand and seven - eight
, it qualifies for long term capital gain
twelve thousand, three hundred and forty-five let's see the taxable calculations where
before that let's there is an information that on july three hundred and twelve thousand and eighteen
due date for furnishing return of income
are deposits rs thirty lakhs under section fifty-four b for claiming
exemption in future for purchasing agricultural land
as you know that there is a capital gains deposit scheme
, he deposited rs thirty lakhs by withdrawing from the deposit
account he purchased agricultural land for rs twenty-seven lakhs
till june nine two thousand and nineteen assuming that the income of r
from other sources
, let's see how the tax is being charged?
let's discuss some problems of capital gains
during the previous year two thousand and seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty are rs ninety-five thousand and
one hundred and eighty thousand respectively, where to find out the taxable
income of r further assessment year two thousand and eighteen - nineteen and two thousand and twenty - twenty-one
crux of the problem is that he deposited rs thirty lakhs
in the capital gains gains investment scheme,
but ultimately he utilized twenty-seven lakhs
and the issue is that if the full amount is not utilized the
balance amount is taxable
, let's see the solution how it is being shown here
, twelve thousand, three hundred and forty-five we can show it in this column ways
full value of consideration is one million, one hundred and fifty thousand
shares sale consideration is four hundred and fifty thousand ,indexed cost of
the acquisition it is held for more than one year
he qualifies for indexed cost of acquisition is four hundred and twenty-four thousand, two hundred and twenty
capital gains is twenty-seven thousand, seven hundred and eighty and there is no exemption
, the balance twenty-seven thousand, seven hundred and eighty is taxable
rural agricultural land is not taxable, it is free,
it is not a capital asset at all
, sale consideration is not taxable
urban agricultural land is of course, taxable from seventy-one lakh we deduct the
indexed cost of acquisition of one million, five hundred and sixty thousand, six hundred and fifty-six
but the expenditure incurred in connection with
, capital gain is five million, five hundred and thirty-nine thousand, three hundred and forty-four
and never mind it he has deposited thirty lakhs in the
capital gains the deposit scheme
, he can claim exemption under section fifty-four b
, the balance amount is taxable for the assessment year one thousand, nine hundred and twenty one thousand, eight hundred and nineteen
debentures he sold it for five lakhs
indexed cost of acquisition is two hundred and fifty thousand
, it is two hundred and fifty thousand is the capital gain
, balance two hundred and fifty thousand is taxable
personnel car is personnel asset it is not taxable
transport of capital asset is ten thousand
as it is not capital asset
, let's see the computation of total income,
total income from capital head is two million, eight hundred and seventeen thousand, one hundred and twenty-four
income from other sources is ninety-five thousand gross total income is two million, nine hundred and twelve thousand, one hundred and twenty-four
there is no deduction
, taxable income for the assessment year eighteen - nineteen is two million, nine hundred and twelve thousand, one hundred and twenty-four
, what happened the amount thirty lakhs which was deposited and which
was claimed as exemption in earlier years, ultimately he
utilize twenty-seven lakhs
, balance three lakhs is taxable in the later assessment year
, net sale consideration is one million, one hundred and forty thousand
with any other income
, in the year assessment year two thousand and twenty-one
these three lakh rupees will be taxable and
in that year the total net income for taxability is four hundred and eighty thousand
, these are the four problems and solutions
which we showed to you and hope that this gives you a
comprehensive idea of capital gains taxation
thank you very much
, as it is a long term capital asset,
, we will calculate the indexed cost of acquisition
how the indexed cost of acquisition is calculated?
the cost of cii on the year of purchase one hundred and thirteen
while in two thousand and seventeen it is two hundred and seventy-two
two hundred and seventy-two divided by one hundred and thirteen into the cost of acquisition ninety-five thousand
and we hope that with this discussion, the concept of capital gain
it comes to two hundred and twenty-eight thousand, six hundred and seventy-two or rs six hundred and seventy-three and which is shown here
, this is the indexed cost of acquisition
, when we deduct the indexed cost of
acquisition from net sale consideration, we get long term
capital gain as nine hundred and eleven thousand, three hundred and twenty-seven ,i am repeating
full value of consideration less any expenditure incurred on the
transfer of the asset here in this case ten thousand rupees was spent
, net sell consideration is one million, one hundred and forty thousand
we have calculated the indexed cost of acquisition
which is ninety-five thousand into two hundred and seventy-two divided by one hundred and thirteen and it comes to two hundred and twenty-eight thousand, six hundred and seventy-three
will be more clearer to you
indexed cost of improvement is not there it is nil so long term
capital gains taxable is nine hundred and eleven thousand, three hundred and twenty-seven rupees
, this is problem number one at your solution
let's see another problem
m furnishes the following information about his
incomes during the previous year two thousand and eighteen - 19:
capital gain rs twenty thousand from a house
which he occupied for one year
before the date of sale on thirty six two thousand and eighteen
secondly, on thirty-one st january two thousand and eighteen
let's discuss problem number one
he sold equity shares of xyz limited for rs two hundred and twenty thousand
through a recognized stock exchange, which were
purchased by him on one four two thousand and two and he sold it at thirty-one one two thousand and eighteen
securities transaction tax paid rs one hundred and twenty-five
fair market value of the shares on thirty-one one two thousand and eighteen was rs one hundred and eighty thousand
thirdly, he sold an agricultural land for rs six hundred and fifty thousand on thirty th april two thousand and eighteen
the land was owned by him
since fourth july two thousand and one and was purchased for rs six thousand
the land is situated with a population of eight thousand, five hundred this is important for us
the land is situated in a village with a population of
a piece of land was bought by mr sharma in may, two thousand and four
less than ten thousand that is eight thousand, five hundred
next on twenty-eight two two thousand and nineteen he sold a flat for rs one million, two hundred thousand
which was purchased by him on one one one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven for rs fifty thousand
the fair market value of the flat was four hundred and twenty thousand on one four two thousand and one
he purchased in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven sold in two thousand and eighteen
for more than three years obviously
, m is a resident of india
compute his taxable income from capital gains
for the assessment year two thousand and eighteen - nineteen
we have one thousand, two hundred and thirty-four cases,
for rupees ninety-five thousand and the same was sold in april two thousand and seventeen
let's see capital gain on sale of house,
the first house which is occupied for one year,
, it is a short term capital asset
, straightaway short term capital gain is two hundred and twenty thousand
shares two hundred and twenty thousand cost of acquisition is one hundred and eighty thousand
long term capital gain is forty thousand
but this game is exempted under section ten ( 38)
sale of equity shares
capital gain on sale of flat sale consideration is one million, two hundred thousand
indexed cost of acquisition is one million, one hundred and seventy-six thousand
for rs one hundred and fifteen thousand
we have calculated the indexed cost of acquisition of one million, one hundred and seventy-six thousand
in this way four hundred and twenty thousand into two hundred and eighty by one hundred it becomes one million, one hundred and seventy-six thousand
, this way it is being calculated
, long term capital gain is twenty-four thousand
, if we calculate that is the short term capital gain
and this is the long term capital again this is not taxable
, total income taxable income from capital gain is forty-four thousand
, out of the five assets, if we see
the cost of acquisition in first case, we have seen that in this
case that is one hundred and eighty thousand this one hundred and eighty thousand has come
where he has paid a brokerage rupees ten thousand
from this calculation which we have shown in the note two that
cost of acquisition is ,it will be higher of cost of share
sixty thousand was the cost of acquisition and lower of fair
market value on thirty-one one two thousand and eighteen of one hundred and eighty thousand and sale price two hundred and twenty thousand
whichever is lower, of this lower is one hundred and eighty thousand
and cost is sixty thousand higher of these two
it is one hundred and eighty thousand is the cost of acquisition
secondly the rural agricultural land which is situated in the village
is not a capital asset and there will be no capital gain
on transfer of such agriculatural land
the question is what will be the taxable capital gain
welcome friends,
let us make it clear that there is no relationship between the term
citizenship and residential status
an indian citizen may be a non resident, whereas a foreigner
may be a resident in india
it depends on the rules for residential status
secondly for different kinds of persons
the residential status may be different
the rules for individuals and huf,
the rules are different from the rules for companies and other persons
that's why we learnt that what are the residential status rules
welcome to week two day one session
for different kinds of persons
another interesting fact is that the residential status may be
different in different assessment year
an individual may be a non resident in two thousand and sixteen - seventeen assessment year,
whereas he may be resident in assessment year two thousand and seventeen - eighteen
, there is no rule that a person
should be of the same residential status over the years
another interesting fact is that a resident in india
may be resident in india as well as he may be a citizen or resident
in abroad also
today we'll be learning the residential status and tax incidence
, you only see what are the rules for residential status
and accordingly the determination of residential status will be there
section six of the income tax act
defines the residential status
we will now learn what are the rules for residential status
there are basic conditions: basic conditions are defined
under section six ( 1) of the act
there are two basic conditions that a person or a individual
these are the rules for individual and huf
, he/she should be in india for a period of one hundred and eighty-two days or more
income tax act one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one <lp says that the tax incidence or the tax burden
during the previous year
the second condition is that he should be in india
for a period of sixty days or more
and three hundred and sixty-five days or more during four years preceding the previous year
, let me go back to again these two basic conditions
if an individual is in india for a
period of one hundred and eighty-two days or more during the previous year he/she
will be resident in india or if the stay is less than one hundred and eighty-two days
then we have to see the condition number two,
whether he stay or her stay during the previous year is sixty days or more
falls on a assessee on the basis of his or her residential status
and we will also calculate his or her stay
during the four years preceding the previous year,
which should be more than three hundred and sixty-five days
if an individual satisfies any one of these two conditions,
he or she will be treated as resident in india
but if an individual cannot satisfy in any of these two conditions,
two basic conditions, then his status will be non resident in india
there are two exceptions of this rule
an indian citizen, who leaves india
as a member of a crew of an indian ship
during the previous year
for the purpose of employment outside
or an indian citizen or person of indian origin
engaged outside india in an employment or a business
or profession then condition number two, that is sixty days plus three hundred and sixty-five days
during the four years will not apply
, if their stay in india is not more than one hundred and eighty-two days they will
be treated as non resident in india
a resident individual, maybe
an ordinary resident or not ordinary resident
for this purpose, we have to see the additional conditions,
this session will completely devote to learn
which is given under section six ( 6) of the act
these additional conditions are number one,
he is in india for a period of seven hundred and thirty days
or more during the seven years preceding the previous year
condition number two, he or she is a resident in india
for at least two years out of ten years preceding the previous year
if an individual satisfies both the additional condition
then he or she will be treated as a resident and
ordinarily resident in india
how the resendential status is determined ?
and how tax incidence falls
on an assessee on the basis of his or her resedential status ?
hello learners,
and the income tax department now is efficient enough
to refund that amount if more amount of tds is there
don't worry about the tds at all in case of tds you
will get an entry at your twenty-six as a form and from there you can
link it to your income tax return
if more tds is there, you will get the refund at once
deposits reporting of fixed
deposits or recurring deposits in your tax return
i may suggest that as a good citizen, you must report the earnings
from fixed deposits and recurring deposits in your tax return regularly
can advise others
even if there is no tds from the side of the banker
let's see the family pension
family pension ,that is,
if one is collecting pension on behalf of someone who is diseased,
then you must show this income under the income from other sources
there is a deduction of rs fifteen thousand
or one third of the family pension received,
which is lower from the filing a pension income
this is added to the taxpayer's income and tax must be paid
at the tax rate that is applicable
that the whole compliance of tax can be made accurately
there is the winnings from lottery, game shows, puzzles
which come as you know windfall received
if one receives money from winning from lottery
online tv shows etc
it will be taxable under the head income from other sources
the income will be taxable at the flat rate of thirty percent
and you know after adding cess it will become thirty-one two percent
, these are some of the issues i thought that let me
discuss with you before we close the discussions on
income from other sources
let's see the facts one by one
thank you
first one is the savings bank account it's interest income
if someone has observed that these sections
like section fifteen section sixteen section seventeen deals with income from salary
and then from section twenty-two
it is income from house property
that is the second type of income
in between some sections are missing
let's discuss some interesting facts
actually these sections are there when we had six sets of income,
interest on securities was the second head of income
but with the rationalization of income tax,
this head of income had been abolished and now we
have only five heads of income and that's why interest income
comes under income from other sources
regarding savings bank account we have to say that
interest that gets accumulated in your savings bank account
must be declared in your tax return
under income from other sources
from the chapter income from other sources
but note that bank does not deduct tds on savings bank interest
it is up to the taxpayer up to the assessee to show it
in the income tax return
interest from both fixed deposits and recurring deposits
is taxable while interest from savings bank account
and post office deposits are tax deductible to certain extent
but all of these are shown in the income tax return
under the head income from other sources
interest income from a savings bank account
or a fixed deposit or from a post office savings bank account
income from other sources is the last head of income
are all shown under the head interest
income under the head income from other sources
let's see the deductions on interest income under section eighty tta
make it clear that for a resident individual age of sixty years or
less or huf, interest earned up to rs ten thousand in a
financial year is exempt from tax
the deduction is allowed on interest income earned from make it clear
savings account with a bank
savings account with a cooperative society
carrying on business or banking
and it encompasses all incomes which cannot be accommodated
and savings account with a post office
remember section eighty tta the deduction up to rs ten thousand
is not applicable to senior citizens
senior citizens are not entitled to benefit
under section eighty tta for them there
is another section eighty ttb which i'll be discussing just next
let's say tax on fixed deposits
fixed deposits interest that one receives is added along with
other income that he or she has such as salary or professional income
and he or she has to pay tax on that income at the tax rate
in any other heads like income from salary,
that is applicable to him or her
tds is deducted on interest income when it is earned,
though it may not have been paid
bank will deduct tds on interest accrued each year
on an fd of say five years therefore, it is advisable to
pay taxes on an annual basis instead of doing it
only when the fd matures
then they advise that income tax should be paid
on an annual basis rather than you wait for the fd to
mature at the end and then we will pay tax
income from house property, business and profession capital gains
let's see about a senior citizen section eighty ttb
senior citizens with effect from one st april two thousand and eighteen
will enjoy an income tax exemption up to rupees fifty thousand
on the interest income they received from fixed deposits with banks,
post offices etc under section eighty ttb
mind it eighty ttb is exclusively for senior citizens
and it is on interest on fixed deposits with banks or post offices
and the deduction is as high as rupees fifty thousand
, please advise senior members of this particular section eighty ttb
regarding tds on fixed deposits, banks are required to deduct tax
it gives a wide spectrum of income,
when income from deposits held in all bank branches put together
is more than rupees forty thousand in a year forty thousand has
been made this year's budget prior to financial year two thousand and nineteen - twenty
it was rupees ten thousand
from this year onwards, it was forty thousand
and banks will deduct income tax from the interest on fixed deposit
a ten percent tds is deducted if bank details are available
if pan details are not available then twenty percent will be deducted
see those people those persons who earn less than
the exemption limit, they can avoid the tds and by submitting
which are included under the set, but there are certain specific issues
the form fifteen g and fifteen h to the bank and requesting them not to deduct tds
but remember the people who are liable to pay tax
that is whose income is more than the exemption limit
should not submit fifteen g or fifteen h even if it is insisted by the bank,
please fifteen h is for senior citizens, that is sixty years or older
and fifteen g for everybody else
one thing to remember that tds is not
at all the tax which is done as a payment
tds is only an advanced things
if your actual tax is less, you can very well show it in the return
where the learners can take note of these things as well as
hello, welcome learners
cash transaction the government has imposed
two percent tds for withdrawing cash from bank accounts
another important thing which is there is that itr filing is made
mandatory in certain cases
as per the current laws, a person is required to file itr
if his or her total income exceeds maximum income not
chargeable to tax subject to certain exceptions like at this
moment two hundred and fifty thousand it becomes a limit
but, even if a person does not reach that amount of income,
but if the amount deposited in current account held with bank or
more than rs five crore have to pay a higher amount of surcharge
cooperative bank exceeds rs one crore in any financial year,
expenditure incurred on foreign travel
exceeds rs twelve lakh in a financial year
if an individual incurred an electricity bill
of rs one lakh or more in a year claiming capital gains
exemption on investment on house
in that case even if their income does not reach the exemption limit
even then, this person's will be required to file
mandatorily the income tax return
this is the new insertion
but for the lower level of income earners
parking and other charges come under the ambit of tds
with effect from september one two thousand and nineteen
any payment made towards buying of property including payments
made with respect to amenities such as club membership fees,
car parking fees, electricity and water maintenance fees etc
we ascertained the amount of tds to be deducted while making the payment
currently, tax is deducted only for the payment made
with respect to property and other payments made for
services are not included
this is a particular step towards making tax compliance more wider
individual whose taxable income
as well as tds on payments exceeding rs fifty lakh to contractors
that is individuals and hindu undivided families
with effect from one st, september two thousand and nineteen
will have to deduct tax at the rate of five percent
for payments made to contractors and other professionals
if it exceeds rs fifty lakhs in a year
presently, individuals and hufs
are not required to deduct tax
at source on payments made to contractor and professionals
nris to pay tax on gifts received by resident indians
does not exceed rs five lakhs will continue to
as per our budget proposals, gift received by non-resident indians
that is nris from someone residing in india will come
under the tax ambit
as per budget documents, this will apply
for the money paid or property situated in india transferred
on or after july five two thousand and nineteen
to give relief to the salaried class, in my first
week classes i have shown some data which was presented by
the finance minister arun jaitley who says that seventy-six lakhs
people only show income tax return that is their earning
avail the tax-rebate and thereby will pay zero tax
more than rupees five lakhs,which is unbelievable
and irony is that out of seventy-six lakhs fifty-six lakhs are salaried employees
, it is a fact that majority of the income tax
has been collected from the salaried employees
because their incomes are transparent
, salaried employees need to be given some kind of relief
, standard deduction was introduced two years back,
it was rupees forty thousand
and now these budget has increased
the deduction of salary from rupees forty thousand to rupees fifty thousand
i think it will be clear if i show you a table
for the next financial year
no tax or notional rent there is another good news that is if a person
owns two houses, which are under residential accommodation of self,
earlier only one house was taken as
self occupied and the gross annual value was taken as nil
other house was taken as a deemed to be let out
and notional rent was to be charged as tax
this year budget proposes that he will not
be required to pay tax or notional rent or deemed rent on
your second house if it is lying vacant
this table shows that income up to rs two five lakhs
, a person can show gross annual value nil
into self occupied properties instead of one as earlier
i have already discussed it in the capital gains chapter
but even then to repeat that, if you sold a house,
and then to save tax you can invest in long term capital gain
and this year it is allowed in two houses instead of one earlier
however, this can be availed if capital gains
do not exceed rs two crore and it is once in a lifetime of an individual
, these are some of the benefits which are given
or in the newly placed budget by the union finance minister
tax rate is nil there is no surcharge there is no cess
ms nirmala sitharaman
and will be applicable for the next assessment year
, i thought learners should know these things
before we close our discussions on incomes
from different heads
thank you
from two hundred and fifty thousand and one to rs five hundred thousand the tax rate is five percent
and there is no surcharge though there is the cess
and at the end of discussion on income from other sources,
education cess is four percent
but a rebate up to rs one million, two hundred and fifty thousand is available for those
whose net taxable income does not exceed rs five hundred thousand
that means any person earning income up to rs five lakhs
need not paid any amount of tax because the tax
rebate amount is increased
but if a person earns more than rupees five lakhs,
then this tax slab will be applicable
in that case that person has to pay five percent tax on
this slab two hundred and fifty thousand and one to rupees five lakhs , this is the difference ,
i thought that let me discuss some issues
we cannot straight away say that the exemption limit is
rupees five lakhs no, any person earning income up to rs five lakhs
need not pay tax but exemption limit is rupees two hundred and fifty thousand
, as it is a progressive rate of taxation
the tax rate increases from five percent
next is twenty percent there is no ten percent slab, next is thirty percent which is the maximum
, if a person earns up to rupees fifty lakhs the tax
rate will be thirty percent for the amount
exceeding rupees ten lakhs and there is no surcharge
but, if the income is more than rupees fifty lakhs
which have come in budget two thousand and nineteen
then the surcharge comes ten percent and the surcharge gradually
increases to fifteen %, twenty-five %, thirty-seven percent that is more than rupees five crore,
the surcharge will be thirty-seven percent of the tax
, but in all the cases the cess is four percent
what happens if we see that, due to this increased
introduced surcharge, those with incomes between rs two crores
and five crores will effectively have to pay thirty-nine percent as tax
and those with income more than rs five crore
will have to pay forty-two percent of tax
thus the tax burden on super rich is made a bit higher
, that you were updated about the changes that have been
to say that there are certain other changes
which are being brought in, we can say that nps withdrawl, nps is
the national pension system, it becomes tax free
that is those investing in the national pension system have another
reason to cheer in this year's budget two thousand and nine and it has finally
announced the move to make lump sum withdrawals at the time of
maturity as tax exempt
nps at the time of maturity, allows the
investor to withdraw sixty percent of the corpus as lump sum and the
remaining forty percent to be used as compulsorily buy annuity plan
brought by budget two thousand and nineteen
those learners who want to know more about the nps can read
as per current law forty percent of the lump sum withdrawal is tax-exempt
from the sixty percent corpus
and also the contribution to the nps
comes under the deductions under section eighty c
we can see the other changes that additional tax break for
buying an affordable house
as announced in budget two thousand and nineteen an individual can
claim an additional deduction of one five lakhs on interest paid on
home loan under the newly introduced section eighty eea,
the first one that is important to discuss is that
this is a newly introduction section, but there are certain conditions
the conditions are that the loan must be taken
between april one two thousand and nineteen and march thirty-one two thousand and twenty
learners you can help others to suggest that
if a housing loan is taken between
april one two thousand and nineteen to march thirty-one two thousand and twenty the value of the property must
not exceed rs forty-five lakhs individual should not own any
house on the date of sanctioning of the loan
these are the three term conditions of course
in that case section eighty eea gives that
there is no change in the income tax slabs
additional deduction of rs one five lakhs is available over and
above existing rs two lakh deduction on the home loan
interest paid under section twenty-four that means, if a person does not
own a residential house and wishes to buy a house and if
he or she can take a loan during the period april one two thousand and nineteen to march thirty-one two thousand and twenty
for a house property of rs forty-five lakhs
in that case he or she can claim a total deduction of three five lakhs
of interest payment on loan under section twenty-four that is income from
house property the deduction is two lakhs and additionally under
section eighteen specifically eighty eea,
however, there is a tax on super-rich that is those earning
additional deduction of rs one five lakhs is possible
, this is the changes that has been brought
another thing to discourage cash transactions and
to push digital payments, budget two thousand and nineteen has proposed to impose
tax deduction at source at the rate of two percent if the total cash
withdrawn in a financial year exceed rs one crore from a bank
or post office or a cooperative bank from a single account
however, this proposal will come into effect from
september one two thousand and nineteen and this is only a tds
and this is not a tax just to crack the
more than rs two crores but less than rs five crore and those earning
let us have one example on residential status
if the huf is resident, then the status of the karta
determines whether it is resident and ordinary resident or resident
but not ordinarily resident
if the karta is resident and ordinary resident,
then the huf is resident and ordinary resident
if the karta is resident but not ordinary resident, then the
huf is resident but not ordinary resident in india
the karta must satisfy both the additional conditions as
specified under section six ( 6) for resident and ordinary resident
the relevant assessment year is two thousand and nineteen - twenty
, the previous year will be just before that two thousand and eighteen - nineteen
we are to calculate the stay of malcom marshall
during the previous year that is two thousand and eighteen - nineteen
and which is given the question as eighty-seven days
, thus he is not satisfying basic condition number one
that is the stay of one hundred and eighty-two days
but as his stay is more than sixty days
and he is not an indian citizen, neither a person of indian origin,
as such we have to calculate his stay during four years
malcolm marshall is a foreign citizen,
preceding the previous year
we say when we add up his stay during two thousand and seventeen - eighteen
two thousand and sixteen - seventeen two thousand and fifteen - sixteen two thousand and fourteen - fifteen that is the
four years preceding the previous year we find that
his total stay during the year is six hundred and fifty-one days
thus he satisfies condition number two of basic condition
as specified under section six ( 1) of the act
thus, malcom marshall is resident in india
for the assessment year two thousand and nineteen - twenty
a resident individual may be
not being a person of indian origin
an ordinary resident or not ordinary resident
to determine this, we have to find out his stay
during seven years preceding the previous year and his
residential status during ten years preceding the previous year
if we plot the days of stay during seven years
preceding the previous year, since two thousand and eleven - twelve till two thousand and seventeen - eighteen
the total gives us as stay of one thousand, one hundred and ninety-six days
that is his stay during seven years is one thousand, one hundred and ninety-six days,
which is more than seven hundred and thirty days
as required under additional condition specified in section six ( 6)
let us determine his residential status
, as he satisfies one condition of the
section six ( 6), we have to see the other condition,
which says about the residential status
, this chart shows about the residential status
if we come from backward
that is just preceding the previous year that is two thousand and seventeen - eighteen
he is resident in india because he stayed
for a period of two hundred and eighty-one days,
that is he satisfies one hundred and eighty-two days or more
and that's why he is resident in india
for the assessment year two thousand and nineteen - twenty on the assumption that
in sixteen - seventeen he stays eighty-six days,
thus he is not satisfying condition number one of one hundred and eighty-two days,
but we have to see his stay during the four years
preceding the previous year that is his stay during
two thousand and fifteen - sixteen fourteen - fifteen thirteen - fourteen twelve - thirteen if we add up we see that his stay is
more than three hundred and sixty-five days
and that's why he is satisfying condition number two
during the financial year sixteen - seventeen
in such way, we have seen his residential status
for the year fourteen - fifteen thirteen - fourteen twelve - thirteen eleven - twelve
during the financial years two thousand and four - five
ten - eleven in the year ten - eleven his stay is only thirty-one days
thus he is not satisfying any of the basic conditions
, his status will be non resident
but in two thousand and nine - ten and two thousand and eight - nine his stay is sufficient
for being a resident in india
in two thousand and nine - ten he is resident in three hundred and forty-one days
, he satisfies condition number one and in two thousand and eight - nine
though his stay is less than one hundred and eighty-two days, but he stayed during the
preceding four years that is two thousand and seven - eight six - seven five - six four - five exceeds three hundred and sixty-five days
, he satisfies condition number two
to two thousand and eighteen - nineteen he was present in india
, if we see the table
will find that he is non resident only in one year
that is,he is resident in nine years
out of ten years preceding the previous year,
where the requirement is only two years out of ten years
under section six ( 6)
thus, he satisfies both the additional conditions
as laid down under section six ( 6) and one of the basic conditions
under section six ( 1) of the act
thus, the residential status of malcom marshall
as shown in the table
for the assessment year two thousand and nineteen - twenty
is resident and ordinarily resident in india
i think it is a comprehensive example, which gives
a thorough idea about the residential status of an individual
i am grateful to dr vinod k singhania and dr kapil singhania
because the idea of this problem has been taken from their book,
direct taxes law and practice published by taxman's publications
mind it an individual must satisfy
both the additional conditions
in other words it means if an individual does not satisfy
any one of the above conditions in that case his status will be
resident but not ordinarily resident in india
in case of huf the rule is almost same
but with a big difference
a huf will be resident in india if the control and management of
its affairs is situated wholly or partly in india
an huf will be non resident if the control and management
of the efforts is situated wholly outside india
in that case only it will become non resident huf
a resident huf may be ordinary resident or not ordinary resident
we are to determine the residential status of mr malcolm marshall
residential status of companies let us discuss how the
it is not taxable for resident,
but not ordinarily resident and non resident
gift received outside india by an individual from a friend
it is also taxable for resident an ordinarily resident,
but not taxable for not ordinarily resident and non resident
gift received at delhi by an individual from a friend
as it is received in india in that case, it is taxable for
resident and ordinarily resident, resident but not ordinarily resident,
as well as non resident
last example i may take that income earned
are known as foreign companies
and received outside india in the past and later on
remitted to india during the previous year
so, the income was earned during the past years
and probably the tax might have been paid on that
and now that income is remitted to india,
this is a good case of remitting of foreign exchange to
india which we need in that case, it is no no no, that is
does not taxable, neither for resident and ordinary resident,
resident but not ordinarily resident as well as non resident
we may end this discussion with some tax planning tips
and indian company is always resident in india
one may be that an indian citizen
or a person of indian origin,
he or she wants to come to india and stay
for more than one hundred and eighty-one days,
without losing his or her status of non resident is it possible
because section basic conditions given under section six ( 1)
says the number one condition that if
an individual stays in india for a period of one hundred and eighty-two days,
in that case he or she will becomes resident in india
so, if a person wants to stay for more than one hundred and eighty-two days
but in case of a foreign company, the rule is a different
in a year, is it possible?
yes, it may be possible if he or she plans the visit in such a way
that it falls in two previous years
in one previous year, it is not more than one hundred and eighty-one days
in this way, we will try to give the tax planning tips
in different discussions and this is the discussions we make on
this residential status and tax incidence
thank you
in case of foreign companies we have to see
the level of turnover if the annual turnover
of a foreign company is less than fifty crores
in that case, it will always be a non resident company
<p> but in case of foreign companies whose turnover is more than
fifty crores, we are to see a term called poem
poem stands for place of effective management
residential status of companies is determined
for foreign companies whose turnover in the previous year
is more than fifty crore poem is important
poem is the place of effective management
that means where a place where the management and commercial decisions
that are necessary for the conduct of the business of an entity
as a whole are located
if the poem is situated in india,
in that case it will be a resident company
and other case, it will be a non resident company
now, let us discuss the relationship between
there are indian companies as well as there are foreign companies
residential status and tax incidence but before that,
let me clear a concept called indian income and foreign income
there are some incomes, which are treated as indian income
and there will be some income which will be treated as foreign income
let's see the criteria by which this income
can be categorized as indian income as well as foreign income
and indian income is the income which is received
or deemed to be received in india and accrues and arises
or deemed to accrue or arise in india
that means any income which is received in india
indian companies are those which are registered under the companies act,
or accrues in india is an indian income
similar way an income which is deemed to be received in india
or deemed to accrue in india is an indian income
secondly, if an income
which is received outside india but accrues or arises
or deemed to accrue or arise in india,
this is also treated as indian income
music
let's see the incidence of tax for different tax payers
an indian income is taxable for all categories of persons that means,
one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-six and now, it is companies act two thousand and thirteen
it is taxable for resident and already resident
it is taxable for resident but ordinary resident in india and
it is also taxable for non resident
but a foreign income for resident an ordinary resident,
it is taxable in india,
but for not ordinary resident, it is not taxable in india,
except in two situations, that is if the business income
is controlled from india
or if the profession is set up in india, only these two cases
the foreign income will be taxable in the hands of not ordinarily resident
so, any company registered under the prevailing companies act in india
but in case of non resident a foreign income is not taxable in india
so, we see that for a non resident,
the incidence of tax is much lower than the resident in india
so, for tax planning purpose normally a non resident
will not like to lose his or her status as non resident in any
previous year otherwise they will attract more amount of income tax
we can see some examples, that is how the income is chargeable
to tax for different categories of persons
like rental income received in india, but accrues outside india,
but as it is an income received in india, it will be
is a resident company
taxable for all categories of person that is resident an ordinary resident,
resident but not ordinarily resident as well as non resident
second example may be interest income accrued in india
received outside india, but as the income accrues in india,
it is taxable for all categories of persons
income deemed to be received in india accrued outside india
as the income is deemed to be received in india
so, across the residential status,
all the persons will be liable to pay tax in india
income deemed to accrue in india but received outside india
and any other company which is not registered
as the income is deemed to be received,
deemed to be accrued in india
in that case, it is taxable for all categories
of residential status of persons
next example may be business income received
and accrued outside india from a business controlled outside india,
that is the business income received and accrued outside india
and from a business control from outside india
in that case only for resident an ordinary resident
it will be taxable, it will not taxable for resident
under the companies act in india,
but not ordinary resident and it is not taxable for non residents
another example you may take that
business income received and accrued outside india from a
business control from india as the business is controlled from india,
it is taxable for resident and not ordinarily resident
resident and only resident,
but it is not taxable for foreign non resident
rental income received outside india accrued outside india
this is also a case where received and accrued
both outside india, it is taxable for only resident an ordinary resident,
but are operating in india
now we'll be discussing something on exempted incomes
under section eighty c, chapter six a of the income tax act
now, in case of exemptions under section ten
that income does not form a part
of the total income of the person that means, we will not
add that particular income in calculating the total income of
the person
but in case of deductions at first, the income will be added
to the total income and then separately,
it will be deducted as a deduction, which are given under
chapter six a of the income tax act
income tax act one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one categorically mentions a list of incomes,
so, this is the basic difference between
the terms exemption and deduction
let us start with the least of exempted incomes,
that incomes which are not included in the total income,
which is given under section ten of the income tax act
number one, the place of pride in the list
is taken by agricultural income
under section ten ( 1) of the income tax act
agriculture income as defined under section ten ( 1)
includes rent or revenue derived from land situated in india
which are either fully exempted from tax or partially exempted from tax
and used for agricultural purposes
and income derived from such land, through agriculture,
through a process ordinarily employed to render the procedure
that would fit to be taken to the market
and or sale of such agricultural produce in the market
if a person earns income in this way,
then it will be treated as agricultural income under section ten ( 1)
it will be noted that the aggregate provisions do not apply to
the company, llp, firm, cooperative society
what is aggregate provision?
section ten of the income tax act describes
that though agriculture income does not form part
of the total income but for calculation of the rate purposes,
it is first added and then the exemptions are given
from the income tax
we will be discussing this particular issue of
aggregation of agricultural income
at the end of the course, when we'll be
calculating the total income of a person for the purpose of
calculation of income tax
as i have already told that agricultural income
all these exempted incomes
is the income which is defined under section ten ( 1)
it may include income derived from the sale of seeds
income from growing flowers or creepers
rent received from land used for grazing of cattle
required for agricultural activities
income from growing of bamboo
so these are all examples of agricultural income
but i'll also provide some examples of incomes
which cannot be treated as agricultural income
these are income from breeding of livestock
before i discuss the exemption incomes
income from poultry farming income from fisheries
income from dairy farming
so these are not agricultural income
and will not fall under section ten ( 1) as the exempted income
under section ten
let us clear a concept between two terms exemption versus deduction
exemptions are given under section ten
of the income tax act, while deductions are given
welcome participants
in the hands of non residents in india
this is the summary of the section five of income tax act
as far as the scope of total income is concerned
in our next discussions, we will be discussing
the detailed discussion on the residential status of an individual
thank you very much
number one the residential status of the assessee,
number two, the place of accrual or receipt of income
number three, the point of time
at which the income had accrued to or was received by or on
behalf of the assessee
i repeat, number one, the residential status of the assessee
that where was the residents of that particular assessee
we'll discuss detail about the residential status
in our further discussions
secondly, the place of accrual or receipt of income where is the place?
today we'll discuss the scope of total income
whether it is in india or outside india
and thirdly, the point of time at
which the income had accrued to or was received by or on behalf
of the assessee
so the place of accrual of the income is also very important
on the basis of place
the income will be recognized as indian income or foreign income
now suppose, the income is received or deemed to be received in india
during the relevant previous year
or whether the income accrues
as described under section five of the income tax act one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one
or arises or deemed to accrue or arise in india
if either of these two happens in india,
it would be an indian income
repeating again, that means, if income in received in india or
deemed to be received in india or if income arises or accrues
in india or deemed to accrue or arise in india, it would be an
indian income
if both do not happen, like the income is
not received in india or deemed to be received in india
the income does not accrue or does not arise in india
section five of the income tax act deals with the scope of income
he both together happen in that case it would be foreign income
otherwise, if either of these two is present in that case,
it would be treated as indian income
the incidence of tax for different taxpayers,
we say discuss individual and huf and other taxpayers separately
for individual and huf the incidence of tax for different taxpayers
depends on whether it is indian income or foreign income
while we will discuss the residential status in detail
in our following discussions,
you will find there are three categories of residents
it states that scope of total income of a person
one is resident an ordinary resident
secondly, resident but not ordinarily resident in india
and thirdly, non resident
if it is an indian income
it taxable for all three categories of assessees
on the basis of a residency status that is, if it is an indian income,
it is taxable in india, whether the person is
resident an ordinarily resident in india,
resident but not ordinarily resident india,
whether it is non resident, it would be taxable in india
is determined by reference to his residence in india
if it is a foreign income in that case, it will be taxable
if the person is resident and ordinarily resident in india
and it will be not taxable for any non resident
that means, a foreign income is not taxable in the hands of non resident
but if a person is a resident but not ordinarily resident in india
only two types of foreign incomes are taxable in india
any other foreign income are not taxable in indian
now what are these two types is ?
number one, business income
if the business is controlled wholly or partly from india,
in the previous year
and income of profession income of profession
for which is set up in india
in these two cases, a foreign income is taxable in the hands of
resident but not ordinaarily resident
beside these two all other foreign income are not taxable
in the hands of individual or huf,
who are resident but not ordinary resident
now, let's see the incidence of tax for different taxpayers
other than individual and huf
if in case of other than individual and huf,
that means, section five always talks about
there is no category call resident and ordinary resident
so, there are a series of only two categories
number one is resident in india and second one is non resident
and indian income is taxable for both categories
a foreign income is taxable in case the person
is resident in india and for non resident a foreign income is not taxable
regarding the residential status who are resident or ordinary resident
who are resident but not ordinary resident,
who are non resident we'll discuss in detail
in our next discussions
the residents of the assessee the scope of total income of an
in conclusion, we can say that
indian income is always taxable in india,
irrespective of the residential status of the taxpayer
foreign income is taxable in india,
in the hands of resident and ordinary resident
resident or ordinarily resident happens in case the
taxpayer is individual an huf
and in case other than individual huf,
it is the residents
foreign income are not taxable in india,
assessee depends on three important considerations:
but still i have to file the return i am under compulsion to
file my return compulsively since my basic exemption
i have crossed the basic exemption limit of two lakh fifty thousands
who is a practicing chartered accountant for last twenty years
and has wide experience in the field
so today, the entire session we'll be devoting
discussing with ca rajkumar nahata on various aspects of
return on of income and assessment
, may i just start with the discussion
about the process of return of assessment?
, ca rajkumar nahata it's over to you do just
introduce the concept to the learners
thank you and welcome learners
welcome learners welcome to week ten discussions
, today we are here to
learn something about return of income and assessment
,how do we inform or how do we
how do we inform our income
or what we have earned to the income tax department in which manner
so we do so by filing our return of income
, we have to file our return of income
to make aware the department
what we have earned during the year
how we are discharging our tax liability
today, we will discuss a very important aspect of income tax
, all these things we will be learning in this session
, before starting this as i presume that
all of you might be aware of the
concepts of previous year, assessment year, total income,
gross total income and person assessee
because this all these topics
have already been discussed in your earlier lectures
, i suppose, all these issues have already been covered
, the learners can go back and they have a clear concept
about all these things which we have already discussed in week one discussion
and as a good citizen, every assessee
, ca nehata we have heard that the assessee must
compulsorily filethe return on income to the income tax authorities
what is your views on this particular aspect of
compulsory filing of return of income yes
as far as company and partnership firms
assessee are concerned each and every company
and partnership firm is required
to compulsorily file their return of income every year
in case of other assessee, it is not the same
, for individual hufs and other assessee,
must submit the return on income on time
it is not compulsory that you have to file a return every year
, your total income will decide
or your total income will be the criteria
based on which your liability or non liability will be decided
, if our total income,
see if our total income exceeds rupees two lakh fifty thousand
which is the maximum amount or which is the basic exemption
limit which has been fixed by the government,
and this keeps on changing from time to time every year the government
keeps on changing the basic exemption limit
and on the basis of the return of income submitted by the assessee,
so as when our income crosses the basic exemption limit
our liability to file the return of income arises,
and we have to file our return of income every year
, but in case of companies and partnership firms,
this basic threshold limit is not applicable
they have to file income tax return,
irrespective of their income whatever their income is,
that is not matter, they have to file compulsively every year
so this is the compulsory filing of return yes sir,
it probably does under section one hundred and ninety-nine yes
the income tax department acessed the tax of that particular assessment
it is covered by section one hundred and thirty-nine subsection one
so regarding individual, all individuals are not able to
file the income tax return yes, only if their income crosses of a maximum amount
which is not chargeable to income tax act or we can yes sir,
or we can say, the basic threshold limit which the government is set up
then all individuals also must compulsorily file the
return of income under section one hundred and thirty-nine subsection one
but in case of partnership firm and in case of companies
there is no such choices given, they are under compulsion,
that whatever the income may be, they must file
as it is a very practical aspect,
return on income ,here
i would like to add one thing also in this year, there is one confusion
which is prevailing among the assessee thatmy basic exemption limit is
has been raised to five lakhs by the government
, actually this is not the case
they haveprovided for a rebate of tax payable
on income up to rupees five lakhs, but the basic exemption is
still two hundred and fifty thousand , whatever tax liability
you have on your income up to rupees five lakhs
that will be allowed as a rebate under section eighty-seven a
so i thought that let it make be made more practical,
but, basic exemption limit is two fifty thousand still
, even if my income is five lakh rupees or something
i must submit the income tax and show the income tax rebate separately
, i did not paid income tax that is separate case
but the return of income must be submitted
if my income exceeds rupees two lakh fifty thousand,
even if it is less than rupees five lakhs yeah
that means we have to differentiate between
total income and tax payable your tax payable might be nil yes,
suppose my income is four hundred and fifty thousand my tax payable is nil,
and that's why we have invited today, ca rajkumar nahata
now regarding the filing of return is there is any date
this is financial is two thousand and nineteen - twenty
, for the financial year two thousand and nineteen - twenty my due date would be
or due date in case of a the company would be thirty th september two thousand and twenty
and in case of this what we say in case of those persons who are required to
file a report under section ninety-two e, that is in case of international transaction
,there the government is prescribed the due date as
thirty th november two months more yes, and for all other assessee's
other than those which we have covered in above two categories
the due date is thirty-one st july of the next financial year
or you can say thirty-one st july of the assessment year because since we are
or something that is mentioned in the income-tax act one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one
quite aware of financial year and assessment year
, i would like to add a little more thing
about financial year and previous year
you'll see we have to whatever we have earned during the financial year
when will we file the return
only after the end of the financial year we can file our returns
, the department will be assessing our returns
immediately after the close of the financial year once we have filed returns
, that is why we say it is assessment year, the year in which the
assessment will be made by the income tax department
yes, sir yes, the section that is section one hundred and thirty-nine ( 1)
in respect of the income tax return which we have filed
, this is not explained technically
i have explained it practically, what is assessment year
because assessment year in itself it is speaking about itself
that in that year your income will be
assessed by the department in different manners they have different
provisions or different manners of assessing your income as well
, this is the due date
, the normal due date is thirty-one st of july
for all categories for all categories
provides for certain due dates as well , in case of
okay seems like what when the accounts are audited,
yes thirty th september yeah, one more thing thirty th september
if a person's accounts are required to be audited
under section forty-four ab of the income tax act
i already discussing business profits yes, which has already been discussed in the
business and profession , if my turnover crosses the certain
specified limit, then my accounts are liable to be
audited under the income tax act or if my accounts are liable to
be audited under any other law, say cooperative societies act;
companies act
companies, all the companies except the companies
then in case in that case also the my due date is
thirty th september and if i am a partner,
if i am a working partner of a firm
whose accounts are required to require to be audited under
section forty-four ab of the income tax act,
then also my due date would be thirty th september
, thirty-one st july or thirty th september the important
basically these are the two important due dates
but in case of international transactions
it can be extended yeah, these two dates are more relevant, and
which are claiming, which are registered under section twenty-five of companies act
that thirty th november is less relevant
, this is the learning which we have till now that all
good citizens must submit their return on income they must
disclose their income to the income tax authorities
in particular format in a proper manner under section one hundred and thirty-nine ( 1)
and also within a specified due date, which is normally
thirty-one st of july, but in case the accounts are audited, it can be thirty th september
yes, nonprofit companies, they are
required to file the return on or before thirty th september of every financial year
or the thirty th september following the year in which the
following the financial year suppose if
, ca nahata sir,
for them it is not applicable llp is a new entry
yeah, it is a very new concept and
and it has not gained that momentum also
it is not that popular also but because partnership firms,
they are very easy to operate and they are very less compliances,
so that's why llp is still it is not that popular, but itr four sugam
, if i am reporting my income say this is basically for small
businessman itr four it is for known as sugam, sugam yes
because if i'm having, i'm a small businessman, so this is only for business only,
itr four itr four is it, this form cannot be used by any other
simplifying those forms and these forms have come of a long age
for any other reporting any other income
salaried person no no only for business income
, there are a few sections which we have
already discussed in business profession forty-four aa, forty-four a, forty-four ad,
forty-four ae, forty-four af which which deals with presumptive taxation
these sections they are dealing with presumptive taxation
see, i am a small businessman, i'm having a turnover of say one crore or
and below one crore and
it is not practicable for me to keep a accountant and
maintain all those details because, for all those type of
mtaa, there are five six forms
businessman, those who are having turnover below one crore
and to encourage digital transactions, the government has
also introduced or also increase the limit to two crores
for this presumptive taxation
, if you are doing your transactions digitally or
through banking channels, then this one crore
and if it you can extend it to two crore also
, if there are you have to report a certain percentage of profit
, it is forty-four ads for civil contractors and other business
those they have to report a certain percentage of profit it is eight percent
which are presently available and
, if you report eight percent you can file itr four sugam
it is simple, and you may don't go in all account and details
you don't have, you simply have to report the income as per the
rates which have been or as per the manner it is not applicable for big
business houses no sir it is only applicable for show us
when we goes for eligible for presentive type yes sir forty-four ad,
forty-four ae and forty-four afthese three sections they are dealing
basically dealing with presumptive taxation
, there are forty-four ad is for all business and forty-four ae for
trucks those who are applying in the business of applying of trucks
we have to find out the form correct form in which
forty-four af, earlier it was there for retail minorities not
anymore or that is being taken care of by forty-four ad only forty-four ad
that government has decided or fixed a turnover limit
the turnover limit is one core so, all persons
who are having turnover up to five, one crore
and those who are ready to report their income
at the rate which has been prescribed by the government,
which is eight percent they can file the return in a very simple manner in itr four sugam
suppose, if i want, if i say that no
i am not earning income at the rate of eight %,
our returnis, because it is very important that
i am having income of only two percent or three percent or one percent
, then i will have to select itr three in that case
, then i have to show more details yes, then i have to get myobviously
even i have to get my accounts audited, sir
i have to maintain books and i have to get my accounts audited and
i have to file my return in itr three not itr four
those assessees who think that okay for simple, terms eight percent payment is better
so they will go for itr four for those assessees where books of
maintaining books of accounts is not practicable or where
it is in their line of business it is in various lines of business we
we file our return in the correct form
don't find practically it is not possible for them to
obtain all vouchers and all bills
for them basically it is for
contract earlier it was forty-four ad was only for contractors
they have changed from contractor, they have eligible business
they have turned it as all eligible business
they can go for forty-four a if the
turnover is below one crore and they can go for itr four sugam
, if our form is not correct, our return will be considered as defective
and it will presume that we have never filed them
as if we have never filed return
annoying the particular form is very important sir
because we are now want to know that how should we submit the return
, what are the forms?
first we have itr one, we also say it has a sahaj form
sahaj mean simple yes, sahaj mean simple
, it is applicable for individuals
basically all the individuals those who are having salary income
and one house property and other sources
, this house property income other sources income,
these are the different heads of income which we have already
discussed in our earlier sessions
,if you are having salary income
because i have earned ten lakh rupees this time yes sir
and if you are having income from house property only one house property
and if you are having income from other sources say interest, dividend
there are different forms of you might be having
incomes under the head income from other sources
and my income is below fifty lakhs,
if my income is more than fifty lakhs, i cannot
i cannot use itr one sahaj then suppose i am having salary,
i'm having income from house property, i'm having income from other sources,
but since my income has crossed fifty lakhs, i cannot file itr one
, i will have to move ahead to see other forms which forms
i am eager to disclose my income to the income tax authorities right
in which i may file my return of income
, second we have itr two
itr two is that can be used by individual
as well as huf hindu undivided families
they can also use itr two but,
without having business or professional income
, if i'm not having any business or professional income,
then i can file itr two otherwise itr two
is not available otherwise ,
for a business person it is not available yes
you told that the returns should be submitted
in my itr one, the example which i was discussing that my income
since it has crossed fifty lakhs , now, i will have
to opt for itr two in itr two i would be filing my return of income
, itr two is same to itr one but, that is for incomes
above fifty lakhs and i can i should not be having any short of
business income and itr one is applicable only to individual
itr one is simpler then itr two
yes sir, itr one very simple itr two give more information itr two we have
to give more information itr three itr five
those are containing even more information , we will we are
is there is any kind of forms or format by which
coming one by one , itr one and two
one thing i would like to discuss itr one and two are basically
written forms which deal only with your income
, other things are not being taken care in itr one and two
that means what assets which we have acquired
or what are the assets which we are holdinghama
and what liabilities, what loans, those things
we don't have to report anywhere in itr one and two
, this is perhaps one of limitation itr two twice
i should say, because if it is for more than fifty lakhs,
the return should be submitted to the income tax authorities yes,
, there should be some one other
simpler yeah, it is very, very simpler
at least for salary payers the filing of return is very easy
so they did not disclosed all these lengthy
forms or anything, itr two even, yes, it is always itr two a bit,
it is not it is bit lengthier than itr one, but it's still, it is simple
so, then we next form we come for itr three that is also
only applicable to individual and huf
those who are having business income
suppose i am having a proprietorship form
the government has been coming up with ah mt
, the itr which is applicable to me is itr three
if i'm an individual so if i am not an individual, then
we will look for other forms if i'm an individual or a huf
and i am having business income, i might be having other incomes also sir
yes sir, i might be having salary, i might be having this
house property income but if i'm earning business income,
then we will have to come to a itr three
selection of itr forms is very, very
forms are easy, but selection is not that easy
we have persons should yes, yes it he should have a quitlearner
in this area the government has been changing the forms over last
now listening to it can help others also yes, yes, he should have
he should have quite a fair idea of selection particular form which is relevant to
which kind yes, yes because filing the return in correct
form is very, very important if i'm having business income,
i might be having other income, but as soon as i have
earned some business income, form number itr three will be applicable
so next, we come itr four sugam
itr four sugam that is also applicable to individual and huf,
but partnership firms can also file in itr four sugam
but limited liability partnerships llps they can not use itr four sugam
so many years they are in process of
, we have discussed various aspects of itr
exclusive for this only thing ok
then itr six is the companies other than the companies
which are registered under section twenty-five for claiming deduction
or can be exemption under section eleven
and those companies who are claiming exemption under section eleven
they have a particular return that is itr seven
there is a concept these days with digital signature and they
i can put manual signature also yeah
so what is the process of there is itr v, we call it
see this nowadays or in over the last seven, eight years
and there is one more item, sir, capital gains
the department has been moving more towards electronical filing
, every year they are making gradually they are
putting some categories compulsorily in e-filing mode
, every year they are increasing that base of e-filing
, once we have e-filing our returns
we have to verify the return
, who has filed the return?
how will suppose if my return anyone can upload
, whether i have uploaded my return or not
, for that verification, there
if we go through itr one two three four sugam till
there are different modes i can verify
through evcor digital signature
or i can send a hard copy of the itr v
, when i send a hard copy of the acknowledgement
that is known that is known as itr v but if we put digital signature
then itr v is not required to be send, then itr v is not required to be send
so nowadays the department is going for digital
we remember earlier days when we have to prepare the return forms,
go to the income tax office , waiting in queue and then they will
acknowledging by putting a stamp
, we will see that there is no
so those days are now those days are over sir
, we have reached a stage that
even scrutinies are being done online
before even we don't have to go to the department even for scrutiny also
which we will discuss later on, scrutiny assessments and all those
mention of any capital gains if i am having capital gains income
which itr return i will select so, that is
, in that case itr two we has to be selected
, if i'm having also having i cannot go for sahaj,
in that case if i , no sahaj is not there for capital gains
sahaj is not for capital gains sahaj is for salary,
salary, one house property and income from other sources, not for other head sources
, ca nahata has covered so far itr one
no, sir , in that case i have to select itr two
again if i'm having business income also
and capital gains also then i'll have to go to go for itr three
itr two is not available
so that is why selection is very important and selection is very important
now next we come to itr five
, the itr five is for partnership firms
then itr firm is also for a aop's,
association of persons or body of individuals
or any other person but not for individual and huf and companies
which is the most simple one the sahaj
individual huf and companies
they cannot use itr five rest all assessee any assessee they can use
itr five like partnership firm, yes,
association of persons, body of individuals, artificial juridical person,
artificial juridical person yes, yes yes, they can use itr five
but individual huf and companies they cannot use itr five
because for individual and huf we have already seen that
they are being covered by a itr one two , three itr four sugam
, itr five is only for exclusively yes sir
then next form is itr six
then itr 2,for the individual and huf
and that is applicable only for companies
only for companies there is a special form that is itr six
which can be used
only by companies except for those companies
who are claiming exemption under section eleven
section eleven that means those companies which are registered
under section twenty-five of the companies act
they are claiming exemption under section eleven of the income tax act
, for them this itr six normally for nonprofit business yes sir
non non profit, except those companies who are claiming under section eleven
who do not have business income,
all other companies they are to fight yeah,
whether domestic whether foreign all any company yes,
itr six as i remember itr six relates to only
only companies which are engaged in all profit making company
but the whose object is making profit
and then last form we have that is itr seven
, itr seven ,it it is to be used for
a used by charitable persons in fact
, they are section one hundred and thirty-nine sub section four a to four d
, they are being used by charitable trusts, political parties
but income is more than rupees fifty lakhs in a year
, these type of entities they have to use itr seven
charitable persons who are claiming such exemption under section eleven
as we discussed in itr six
itr six may we have discussed that companies
which are claiming exemption under section eleven
they cannot use itr six they have to use itr seven
itr six those companies were claiming under section eleven
for them itr seven yes sir
, in these way itr from itr one to itr seven
whole gamut of assessees are covered yes
then came to itr three with individual huf,
, if we recap this discussion, itr one sahaj
is for individual and huf, who have got
income from salary, income
income from only one house property and income from other sources
and the total income does not exceed rupees fifty lakhs
yeah you can add one thing also sir, that carry forward of losses
that is not permitted in itr one
even in house property, i have carry forward of loss
we cannot use itr if you are not able to set it off completely during that year
, if you have left if you're left with , any loss
who have business income and itr four and a detailed discussion about
which has to be carried forward actually in a chapter of
set of and carry forward losses, we have elaborately discussed the carry forward
, as learners know that in case of house property
carry forward of loss is possible for eight assessment years
so, in that case if there is anything to be carried forward
in house property,, itr one cannot be for them then itr two
house property as well as other sources also that might have be loss
same case of house property or in case of other sources wherever
carry forward is not possible to be shown in itr one they will go for itr two
, itr two is available to individual an huf,
the assessees, who are eligible for presumptive taxation
but without any business or professional right
and itr three is individual and huf who are having their business income
, business or profession right sir
and itr four you have elaborately discussed the sugam form
that is for the people for the assessees
who are eligible under presumptive taxation
and itr five , it is exclusive for firms,
association of persons, body of individual or artificial juridical person
and in itr five we have talked about something extra
about this are exclusively for this only
i think there are more yes sir, there are more
, as we have already started a discussion about the
, what is the importance of filing the return within the due date?
so that also we have to appreciate
if i do not file my return within due date, what i can loss,
or what are the extra privileges which i'm getting
, that has to be those have to be appreciated
, one of the privilege which i loss
if i do not file my return within the due date
is that i cannot carry forward my losses oh great limitations very much
, it's a learning point again
secondly, if the loss is not reported within the due time,
because department is providing offline utilities as well
then the losses cannot be allowed to be carried forward in future yes,
business loss, capital loss,
loss property loss so
those losses cannot be lost property loss can be carried forward ,
if i do not report it if
if you do not report you cannot carry forward any loss, but
for business loss, capital loss you have to file the return within the due date
that is yet another condition
, if you do even if you have reported
but you have reported after the due date,
, we can fill our return in offline utilities,
you are not entitled for setup for carry forward
and subsequently setup and secondly, if i want to claim
deductions, there are certain deductions or exemptions
for which the department has
put certain restrictions that you have to file the return within the due date
suppose eighty ia, eighty ib, eighty ic,
for setting up the profits and gains of industrial undertakings
if i want to claim those deductions, i have to file the return within the dute date
, i cannot claim any deduction once i
file the return beyond the due date
we can generate a file and we can upload the same after uploading
so filing the return within due date is a very good habit
and one should always strive
for filing the returns within due date, because
earlier there was one more privilege
, they have discontinued that earlier,
you could revise your return only if you have filed within the due date
but now, you can revise it and even if even if you have filed
after the due date, we will come on later on so
return of loss is compulsory for any carry forward afterwards
only reporting is not sufficient for business losses,
, we can file a return
for capital loss or for loss from activity of owning maintaining
race horses etc submission of return of loss is very important
, as you have told that only reporting is not sufficient, right sir,
submission of return of loss is very important,
because if it is not submitted on time or within the due date,
losses like business loss, capital loss, loss from activity of owning
and maintaining race horses, etc
are not allowed to be carried forward for a while yes sir
we can find our return in both modes
we can file physically, that means going to
the income tax office and we can file electronically also for
which categories physical returns is allowed, we will discuss that
only for senior as of now,
only for senior citizens, physical filing of return is permissible now
mode of submission, right sir, there i told you that earlier
for rest for all we have to file
compulsory in e-filing logic a lot
we hope that the senior citizen may not be
so much comfortable with e-filing yes, yes, obviously, online transaction, yes, yes, yes,
and that's why probably, that is why offline mode
they have excluded senior citizens,
only those senior citizens whose income does not exceed five lakhs
not for rich senior citizen
only those people can go for offline mode yes sir
otherwise, online is compulsory
the return from we had to fill it up manually, go to the income tax department,
online return they even for them also online is compulsory
but senior citizens they can file their returns
in physical mode but if you have a refund
if you want to claim a refund or if your income is more than five lakhs,
then in all cases that written has to be filed electronically
it must be signed digital signature no no not
electronically we will discuss there are
ok, as you already mension, in case of electronically yeah,yeah
, if i file electronically <lpthen i can file it
electronically under digital signature, i can file electronically under evc
stand in the queue, and then we get a stamp,
, what is evc
, evc is a otp which we receive
on our mobile number which is linked to our aadhar
, that verification code, electronic verification code
a code will come on your mobile
on that particular mobile number which is linked to your aadhar account
, using that code you can e-verify your return
and the third mode is by dispatching the itr v physically
, once i opted for the above two modes,
say digital signature or evc, then i don't have to send
and then we come back keep the things nowadays what we are doing is just putting
itr v anymore , itr v sent to
cpc bengaluru central processing centre
the purpose is that the income tax department wants to verify
the person who has put the electronic form in the
income tax website is the original person right sir
if he see rajkumar nahata, he is submitting his own income tax return
he should be he himself who should submit it right
i should i cannot put his return
myself because in that case, the otp and verification
should be that will understand otherwise,
the things in the online format, making a click and we are submitting
it will create a huge problem a will fill up the form for b,
b will fill up the form for c and making a huge confusion
and that's why to verify theperson
who is filing the return is the original assessee or not this process are there
and there is a time limit also to to verify your returns
within a particular period yes, within a period of one hundred and twenty days
from the date of filing of return, you have to verify the return
, what happens if i do not verify it within a period of one hundred and twenty days
, my return will become invalid
it will be presumed as if i have never filed my return
but there are in income tax that there are different mode of submission yes sir
again i have to refile my return
but nowadays our experiences is good we get a regular sms
yes, yes we get regular sms, regular e-mails,also come
emails also sir emails department is that okay, you have submitted
nobody else has submitted your return
because the return can be processed or returns would be
brought up for processing only after the verification party source
, merely uploading is not complete filings
income tax department will verify yes,
you will have to verify that i have filed return i am the person yes, yes, fine
so can you just elaborate on the mode of submission on this? yes, yes, sure
after that, the department will take up that written for processing
not before that once that verification part is pending
till that time the case will not be taken up for process
, we have learned the process of filing of return
and also the verification of return in this discussion
i see nahata, normally the people will earn income and income tax
every presume that people earning income
sometimes people incur loss also
in business and professional is a common feature
that losses occur so what is the process of informing
, we can prepare our return
the losses earned by a business
or in under any other head to the income tax authorities
, it is very important for us to report the losses
because the department has provided us a facility of
setting of those losses in the subsequent years
, if we do not report our losses properly,
we will loss that privilege of setting we have already seen the rules
for carry forward losses in certain heads of income,
income tax act allows carry forward of losses
, a few moments back, we were discussing about due dates
in both online and offline mode
as you are telling that due date is so important,
income tax department and the authorities are making it as simple as possible
but even then, in some cases there are certain technical thing
where a layman may not be able
to fill it up everything or upload it or upload the documents
and there is a concept called trp's under section one hundred and thirty-nine b,
then this trp's normally help the assessees in filing the returns
can you just tell learners about the profession of tax return preparers?
yes, learners tax return preparers
,if i am facing any difficulty in filing my return
or uploading my return or i am not that much computerheavy
, you can file your return even after the due date,
i don't know these technical things, how to
download the offline utilities, how to create a xml file, how to upload that
, i can take the assistance of tax return preparers
so tax return preparers, they are
the return preparers which was certified by the income tax department
, if you want to become a tax return preparer you can log in
to incometaxindia gov in and therethe required
formalities the required qualifications the required procedure
all those are elaborately discussed in the department's website
,we can take their assistance , it is a very good
but not indefinitely there is some limit there also
career or good prospect you can do a lot and you can help a lot of people
as well as helping yourself
,learners you have seen there is a provision of tax return preparers
, you yourself can become the trp's
or through this learning you can also tell others
that is how to become the tax return preparers
so, that limit is one year from the end of the financial year
before, suppose financial year is one thousand, nine hundred and twenty
it ends on thirty-one march two thousand and twenty-one
, i have a time up to thirty-one st march two thousand and twenty-one to file the return,
after that not allowed after that it is not allowed at all,
only you can file your return in response to section one hundred and forty to one hundred and forty
which we will discuss later on ,
so that means i can take advantage of section one hundred and thirty-nine ( 4),
suppose somehow and assessee misses the due date, right
if an assessee misses the filing of return
within the due date in that case within one year
from the end of the relevant financial year yes, he or she is
eligible to file belated return, belated return can also be filed
, there is a provision of charging of interest
for late late submission of return, yes, sir,,
can you discuss something on
earlier, we hadand still now that provision is there
that provisions is section two hundred and thirty-four a, which provides for
interest on interest for delay filing of returns
is there is any provision for submitting belated return
, if i'm filing or if i'm filing my return beyond the due dates
i am liable for interestthat is under section two hundred and thirty-four a that is
one %of the tax payable for every month or part thereof
, suppose if i my due date is thirty-one st july
and i pay my tax on first september
, i will have to pay interest for two months,
august and september also , once even
if i pay on first september or thirty th september,
i have to i have to pay interest
for the full month because that that is the language or part thereof
yes,suppose if i am not able to fill my return under
, even if i pay during the month interest for
the entire month has to be charged
, there is one , to ensure timely filing,
, the government has also come up with
a new section two hundred and thirty-four fwhich is for delay filing of returns,
suppose my due date is thirty-one st july and in that case we have to classify
to find out what which file is applicable to me
there are two slabs five thousand ten thousand one thousand five thousand ten thousand slabs
, if my income is more than five lakhs,
even if my tax payable is zero,
the provisions as prescribed under section one hundred and thirty-nine ( 1)
yes, yes tax payable is immaterial
what is my tax payable that is not matter?
it might be that i am i am entitled for a refund
i don't have any tax payable but i am entitled for the refund
even than yes sir , even then,
what happens if i file my return after the due date
and my income is more than five lakhs
, if i file before thirty-one st december
then the fine is five thousand
and if i file from first january to thirty-one st march,
that is within the due date my due date is thirty th september or thirty-one july
then the fine is ten thousand rupees ok
, learners its very important point which ca nahata has told
that earlier there was only section two hundred and thirty-four a
which was interest was imposed at the rate of one person per month
the problem was that for the assessees who has got taxable income nil
the interest will also come in nil
to deal with such situation the penalties imposed under section two hundred and thirty-four f
where three categories
it is exactly not a penalty sir, it is a fee it is a fee okay
, remember the term is fee because you have to pay it
whatever due date i'm having, but i'm not able to file the return
while filing the return, penalty penalty is payable only once it is imposed
okey good , just note the difference between the term
it is known as fee,yes , if the return is, belated return is submitted
within thirty-one st december then the
and income is more than five more than five lakhs, the amount of
fee will be rupees five thousand otherwise it will be ten thousand
and if my income is below five lakhs, ok
then the fees will be one thousand till thirty-one st march
, this is section two hundred and thirty-four f being introduced recently
, suppose i am a good citizen,
within the due date then is my right lost
i have not missed the date within due date, i have filed the return
but somehow i have just remember that i missed certain points to mention
in the return or i think that no there was some mistake
in the return by omission or commission
is there any provision for filing revised return?
yes sir revised section one hundred and thirty-nine ( 5) that is dealing with revised returns
, we have a section in place for that also
suppose if i discover any omission or i find that
i missed some income which was required to be reported or
any other omission or which i come toknow
that is the it is not section one hundred and thirty-nine ( 4)
before the end of the assessment year
after assessment it is not allowed no sir
suppose for financial year thirty-one st march two thousand and nineteen two thousand and eighteen - nineteen
i can revise my return up to thirty-one st march two thousand and twenty only
, revise return facilities given but
an assessee must submit the revise return within the assessment year
and for filing a revised return we have to obviously we
we must have filed an original return
yes,, this is another learning which we have
, as in the tax return also we have learned that pay the
that isdealing with belated returns
, ca nahata, let us go for a very very important term
, once we file our returns,
our duties or parties over
, the department comes into play
the department's role that will come into play
, the income taxover the last
decade or two,it has been putting more thrust on self assessment
, whatever you submit, they accepted
so they are relying very much on the assesses
you report your transactions
in a very true and fair manner
, by we have to quote our pan
so they are giving more importance to self assessment
, there are over the years the
selection of cases for scrutiny or detailed scrutiny
those also have come down considerably
and now it is most of the returns are processed based on what we have filed
, they are relying more on
their database pan, aadhar and on all those things
, even it is not that whatever i report that will be
because they have certain checks
there are many things suppose, if i have earned
in different places while opening a bank account,
some income from tejpur university
they have paid me they have deducted tax from me
they have obtained my pan , if i
think that i can hide that income from department,
it is not they are already having that information
, we have to be very honest
if a good citizen nobody cut deduct tax, yes
as a good citizen we have to be honest you have to be honest
we have to be honest now if you have noted ca nahata i was told
that recently the entered scope has changed
say while purchasing any immovable property or various other transactions
earlier, one person used to submit return income tax
department has to ask the person
yes, scrutiny has all the returns
, in majority of the cases,
whatever a person submits to the income tax authorities,
it will be taken as true
, it depends on the individual to tell to disclose
the entire things as honestly as possible to honor
the respect which the income tax department is deposed on individual
and this is what we are talking about self assessment
have been prescribed by the government where
, suppose i have calculated my income as twelve lakh rupees okay sir
and i have seen that this income tax come as,
so what i should pay the tax on my yes sir,
after i have calculated my tax liability, and after adjusting
the text which has already been deducted by various deductors
and the advanced tax which i might have already paid doing that financial year itself,
whatever balance is left
that has to be paid by me before filing of return or
what happens can i file my return without paying self assessment tax,
i can file my return without filing self assessment tax,
quoting of pan has been made mandatory
but that will be considered as a defective return
, i will get a notice
that your return is defective since you have not
paid the self assessment tax and you have file the return
so that defect has to be rectified by or removed by me within the next fifteen days
, it is better that we pay our self assessment and
then later on file our returns, because we'll have to pay interest also
till the date we do not pay taxes
, this is the self assessment tax
under section one hundred and forty a, which you are talking
, when does the liability for
obtaining pan arisesor when it is compulsory that
we have to apply for a pan , see there are
various situations in which the liability may occur number one,
first of all and the foremost for most important is
which now everybody is knows that is the pan permanent account number,
when my income crosses the basic threshold limit
at thisyes, once it crosses to fifty thousand
i have to apply for an pan,
or if my turnover is more than five lakhs
turnover that means the sales
or if i'm doing any business and my sales is more than five lakhs
then also i have to apply for a pan,
although my income might not be two hundred and fifty
,because if i'm making a turnover five lakh say
i might be earning only seventy thousand or one lakh or fifty thousand
i think it is a revolutionary step that
but still i need toapply for pan
and i have seen the use of pan everywhere yes
in many cases when we go the people ask
your pan and it is a mandatory field, in many cases
credit cards suppose you are if your limit is more than two lakhs,
there also they will ask for pan,
immovable property if you register any immovable property for more than
a specified value of prescribed value by the government
which presently is twenty-five lakhs for
small cities fifty lakhs for big cities
the government took one time to have permanent account number for each assessee
for any transactions more than rupees fifty thousand
pan is mandatory pan is mandatory sir and when do you say ten
alphanumeric, alphanumeric number which gives identification
of an assessee with the income tax department
so the fourth character of the pan, we can
find out the status, we can find out
whether the person is an individual, is a partnership firm,
is a company or is a trust, whatever corporate society
the fourth character is the adgp, p means person, i'm an individual,
adgf, firm, adgc company
, can you just a highlight
, the fourth character we can add,
, it is alphanumeric sequence of ten digits
, each digit, each digit having its own significance
, only fourth character, we know, rest of the characters they
we don't have any idea what what that is yeah,
may be stay yeah, yeah they are some because they are confidential as well
fourth character is public that we can identify with the pan
that who is the what is the status of the person
yes, what is the status we can find out that
, you see indian experience with pan is not so much
yes sir, pan as we say permanent account number of pan
satisfactory, you can say, because indians are intelligent
many people had got two three pan, multiple pan and
income tax department that got huge problem in dealing with such kind of people
,we have aadhar yes and quoting of aadhar number is
also there in many income tax transactions yes
, aadhar number also, aadhar was also introduced
not only for income to income tax department, but it was, the aadhar as we everyone know
that is a biometric , we have to give our biometrics to the uidai
, they are taking on biometrics
and they are preparing a database of aadhar
that isour identity with the department
, so far as income tax
or income tax department is concerned
, they have made it mandatory
for linking of aadhar to pan
,the reason behind or the logic behind this is
that the duplication of pan that can be done away
completely with this , i can have duplicate pans,
i can have ten pan, but i cannot have ten biometrics,
i can have only one biometric
,the rest nine pan they will become defunct
, department identifies us by our pan
there is a development in this particular field,
and we can see that many problems can be solved
yeah, that tippers now government is set up the deadline as well
for linking of aadhaar with pan , it has been
increasing the time limits or it has been constantly
extending the deadlines, but still in the coming times it has,
it will be compulsively for everyone to link aadhar with
, learners please suggest all to have one single pan
and also the aadhar, because at one point of time in very distant future,
that without these two numbers, you cannot move anywhere
and through this pan, they they also
even if you have a passport, you have to go somewhere
these two numbers are very much needed not only for income tax purposes,
but for any kind of transactions
direct_tax_4767
, let us discuss about the very important aspect of assessment procedure
as ca nahata is in the profession for last twenty years
has been doing with this
assessment procedure for a long period of time
, let us ask the different kinds of assessments
which we have and let's please discuss about the assessment procedure
make their database of information
, i think that the complete
they have come up with online scrutiny
and slowly slowly it is they are expanding the base
,earlier it was for big cities,
,in small town in this discussion we have seen
that under section one hundred and forty-two if the assessee has not filed return,
in that case, the income tax department can ask
for filing of after filing also they generally issue notice under section one hundred and forty-two if,
if the return is selected for scrutiny ok,
and then one hundred and forty-two ( 1),142 ( 2) and one hundred and forty-three one hundred and forty-three ( 1),( 2), ( 3) one hundred and forty-three ( 1)
one hundred and forty-three ( 2)and one hundred and forty-three ( 3), these are the assessment in respect of the
both the sections are there for giving notice to the assessee asking
notice which is issued by the department
so the cases are taken up for scrutiny, more scrutiny
some information from them or asking from them to file the returns
you have not filed a writen till now , after the
due date goes after due date passes and the assessing officer
sees that still the assessee is not find the return and there is
some information with him, suppose some text has been deducted
or some he has purchased some property and all
those things he these are very common in your practice
yeah, one hundred and forty-two is very common one hundred and forty-two a is very limited use
so remember learners if i find certain returns and i understand that
independence or complete autonomy cannot be given to the assesse, yes,
no income tax department will not ask for anything
suppose i am claiming an exemption
for eighty c, we all know that is no sir,142 is
after i file the return there is no one hundred and forty-two ok
so one hundred and forty-two is suppose the due date has passed on
and i not file my return till now
so the department can issue one hundred and forty-two me one hundred and forty-two to keep up you file your return ok
, the department will it can ask
some information from me, weather i'm having some taxable income or not
suppose i build a very huge building
there must be some kind of fear of assessment
department does not know whether i'm filing a return
so they will issue notice under section one hundred and forty-two <>?b
what is your return filing status till what date you have filed returns
,they know that you are having a immovable property
, they will find out from that information whether,
first of all whether you are filing your returns or not
,if they see that you are not filing they can again
extend those inquiries and take further steps
and what is one hundred and forty-three ( 2) and one hundred and forty-three
one hundred and forty-three ( 2) and one hundred and forty-three and one hundred and forty-three ( 1) also ok see one hundred and forty-three ( 1) is summary assessment
, there is section one hundred and forty-two a talking about certain
or the returns which we are filing
,the departments they are assessing except for prima facie adjustments
suppose prima facie if the department comes to
the see that there is any error which is on the face of it
it is evident or there are no two opinions possible about that
suppose i have claimed depreciation at the rate of forty percent instead of sixty percent
,there are no two opinions and from a prima facie
not informed the acceessee no no not requried yes,yes
but but generally they give a chance
generally they give they give a communication type of thing
enquiry one hundred and forty-two thousand, one hundred and forty-two a both sections are there
to be , we we want or we are proposing adjustment
yes, the income tax department ex parte
will assess the tax without calling but the still generally they give a communication,ok
we are proposing some adjustments under section one hundred and forty-three ( 1),ok
otherwise they can do,yeah because the recently , the delhi high court
in section two hundred and forty-five they have given a judgment
under section 255,you cannot adjust a refund
without giving an oppurtunity to the assessee ,
to be on the safe side they communicate,
they communicate to the assessee one hundred and forty-three ( 2)
, one hundred and forty-two if the there is some information with
and one hundred and forty-three ( 2), one hundred and forty-three ( 3),143 ( 2) , the department has a system of
system which is cass computer assisted scrutiny selection
and manual selection of cases for scrutiny
, so far as manual selection is concerned,
they come out with guidelines every year they come out with guidelines
for selecting certain cases manually
say, if i if a survey has been undertaken at my premises,,
that case has to be compulsively taken up for scrutiny
if the department is impounded some books some records,
then that case is required to be scrutinized compulsory
the assessing officer on during the financial year,
,that is covered under manual selection
, computer assisted scrutiny selection
under that they are selecting some percentage
one %, two %, three percent every year it's automatically? yeah,automatically,
it is not automatically even i will
there are also they have some criterias
,they put some criteria, if there is some if the system notices some
unusual happenings in data suppose my capital last year was fifty lakhs
now it has become three crores ,the department
other than profit, other than profit, it has increased
, he can call for some information or he can
considerably or my salary credit on my current ratio is negative,
my creditors are very high ,those cases the
computer, it selects and selection under section one hundred and forty-three ( 2)
is also two types earlier it was only one type detailed scrutiny
,the department has come up with new concept, limited
and complete scrutiny
,under section one hundred and forty-three ( 2) if they come up with limited scrutiny
so, scrutiny will be limited only to that particular point
on the basis of which the scrutiny has been
taken during demonetization
based on that information he can make further inquiries and
,demonetization period during demonetization period
i deposited say fifty lakhs in my account
,the department wants to scrutinized that particular thing only
that is limited scrutiny the assessing officer cannot touch on
other areas he cannot
make roaming inquiries only for the particular activity, yes,
particular scope, particular point, point on which
scrutiny has been selected yes, and complete scrutiny is that means,
they will complete this scrutiny and all the things
and nowadays the scrutiny also is online yes,
or he can initiate some proceedings even one hundred and forty-two one hundred and forty-two a
so the notice has been given and the assessee is cooperating, yes,
first of all, he must have reasons to believe
or he must have adequate reason to believe
that income has escaped assessment
simply on guesswork or simply
on some information, he cannot initiate one hundred and forty-seven
because since it is a bit harsh provision,
so it cannot be initiated like it is it common?
it is very uncommon, sir, very uncommon and it is used
nowadays it is not used rarely i would say
it is being used very often, quite often but not very often quite often
e-mail id and phone number , in as we know in india,
because nowadays,what happens,the department, what has happened
now the department is more equipped with information
so what is happen, and now it is the department has
built up a very good database they are having
very beautiful information regarding every assessee
where i am traveling, what i am spending where i am going
,they are having virtually at the click of a button,
they have all the information with them
nowadays this one hundred and forty-seven as started to started to be used
very conscious so learners now very, very conscious,
most of the people they don't use computers or they don't have computers
you cannot give any wrong information,
because you are digitally connected from everywhere
if you have given some information somewhere else,
you do not think that it is linked,
but somewhere the income tax department will get the information
and there is a scope for reassessment
thank you ca nahata, it is a nice talking to you, to
learn about all about the return of income and assessment
it was my pleasure also,sir to invite you for another discussion also
thank you, sir thank you thank you very much thank you
they are dependent on others suppose i have approached
some of my friend, you prepare my income tax login
, he also don't know that he's not that much expert,
, he used his phone number and e-mail id
mobile number, mobile number and e-mail id
,whatever notices whatever communications the department is
going through going for paperlessyes,
all correspondence that person yeah that particular mail id or
assessee has gone there, yes, whatever the department,sometime
that particular person's on phone so, it is very important,
very very important that we give only those mail ids or phone numbers
which we are regularly accessing
otherwise we will never come to know about the communication
suppose my case has been selected recently i came up with
such type of case what there was one person
so he was staying in a very remote area , he wanted to file the return
,he approached someone he file his return,
email id and phone numbers will not
of that particular assessee those were of some different person
happens that the income tax department issues notice
,the case was selected for scrutiny
because he has claimed a huge exempt income
he was a tribal so he claimed huge exemption,76 lakhs
,he never came to know about that
,department was quite right, because they had sent notices
on that particular mail id and all those things
, the ito
since he'd never received he never came up,
came before the assessing officer, he neverreplied to those notices
, at the end of because see one hundred and forty-three ( 1),143 ( 2) there is time limits
the assessee is not hearing about this neither he or she has
those assessments have to be completed within a certain time frame
,once a case has been selected for one,
,i would like to add here one hundred and forty-three ( 2&3), the time limits
within which the case when case can be selected and the
time limit within which the case has to be disposed
this is for both the sides ,yes assessee as well as departemnt ,yes,
one hundred and forty-three ( 2),if my case has to be selected, it can be selected only
within a period of six months from the end of the financial year
, for thirty-one st,march two thousand and nineteen
thirty th, september two thousand and nineteen is the last day before which the
cooperated with the department
department can select the case for scrutiny
after that, they cannot no, after that there are different provisions
through which they can trap mee, but not under this section
my case cannot be selected for detailed scrutiny after thirty th september
, once it has been selected, now, there is a time frame
for them to complete the assessment as well
,earlier it was twelve months now, it has been reduced to nine months
great learning from him all this time limits etc
there is a term for best judgment assessment
that is what i was suppose, so, till the assessing officer will
and sometimes the department itself can go for a certain time
wait till the time frame under which he which is required
to complete the assessment otherwise he will be,yeah
because he will before that also you can complete
by giving reasonable opportunities
suppose i have given notice licensing officer he has issued notices three or four times
to the assessee, but there has been no response
so, the assessing officer can go on to
proceed or to complete the assessment
under section one hundred and forty for the best judgment assessment
which you are speaking about
yes,sir nowadays, it is happening more
,i am not cooperating or
even if i received the notice i am not cooperating
or the informations which i furnished
they are not sufficient
,he can complete the assessment
cases certain cases, certain condition, if there is fullfill
the assessing officer can go you can initiate invoke
jugdement it is not to penalize the assessee,
but as per the assessing officer give judgment
then this should be , and one thing is very important
what has happened, this
this best judgment assessment can be made only on the basis of the
information which is available with the ao
suppose, there is information that
i am having an immovable property but the ao's not having any information about that
,he cannot bring on that, but he knows me personally suppose
that property cannot be brought in best judgment assessment
,only on the basis of matters which is available within
based on that he has to make the best judgment
suppose, the assessing officer has made an assessment
and is there is a provision for reassessment also
is,what practically it is going on
yes sir , once
i have filed my return or if even if i have not filed my return
there is the
if i have not filed my return still the case can be reopened
, there are certain conditions, so, that
was section one hundred and forty-seven and one hundred and forty-eight one hundred and forty-nine million, one hundred and fifty thousand, one hundred and fifty-one
they are dealing with reassessment procedures
one hundred and forty-seven is the section under which the ao will issue the notice
, before initiating one hundred and forty-seven
the ao's has to make sure two things
,while filing or returns, two fields are very important
in the following year in which the assessee
earned his or her income and the tax payable in the previous year
is computed in the following year that is in the assessment year
,what happens whether the assessee
will have to pay the tax in the next year?
yes, he or she has to pay the tax
in the next year in total or in settlement of his or her account of tax,
but there is a rule of advance payment of tax, which says
that pay the tax as you earn
,this is known as an advance payment of tax
welcome learners today, we'll be learning
it is obligatory to pay advance tax in every case,
where the advanced tax payable is rupees ten thousand or more
however, a senior citizen not having income for business
from business or profession is not liable to pay advance tax
from the assessment year two thousand and thirteen - fourteen but for other assesses
it is compulsory to pay advance tax and the income tax act as
specified four dates by which part by part, the assessee should pay

from there, we'll deduct rebate under section eighty-seven a
as i have already told that the deduction is now as high as rupees twelve thousand, five hundred
that is, any person earning total income up to rupees five lakh
can avail the deduction then step three will be step
step one minus step two, that is tax on total income,
computation of taxable income for individuals
less rebate under section eighty-seven a
with this we will add surcharge if applicable
and with the tax, we will add the surcharge
from there, we'll add the health and education cess

and ninety-one will be there and the result an figure

except these, all other incomes are taxable in the hands
of an individual let's see
welcome learners this week we will be learning
how the income is computed for an individual

after adjustment of losses
and which is actually the gross total income
,from the gross total income, we will deduct the deductions
which are available under section eighty c to eighty u
there are different categories of persons
, when the deductions are made
from gross total income, we get the total income
or the income on which tax will be calculated
, the importance is that
what are the sections that are eligible to be deducted

we have a detailed discussion separately
in the deductions chapter, but even then we think that
let us again recapitulate or again re emphasize
the sections which are available to individuals

wherever these deductions are eligible an assessee should avail
the deductions under these sections
hence, we have the deductions from tax liability
we calculate the tax liability from the total income
then there are deductions under section eighty-seven a is available

but this year budget, this limit has been enhanced to rupees five lakhs

and relief for double taxation under section nine thousand and ninety a and ninety-one
that is if assesses income in foreign country
,this week, let us devote the time for learning
welcome learners in the previous week we have seen
and we hope that here's the right person to discuss
this particular issue before you
thank you sir kaiser, welcome learners let's begin our topic
for today which is computation of taxable income of companies
we'll start by learning about different definitions of
different types of companies so, let's begin
first, we should know what is the meaning of a company
so, companies defined under section two ( 17)
and it means any indian company
or any body corporate which is incorporated
assessment of tax for individual
under any loss for foreign country so, it means any
company which is formed in india or any company which is
incorporated in a foreign country, also it includes any
institution which is declared by the general or specific order of cbdt
what is cbdt cbdt stands for central board for direct taxes
so, this is the general definition of company
now, under company the different types of company,
we said company covers an indian company
so, what is an indian company
indian company is covered under section two ( 26) and this
this week, we will discuss computation of taxable income of companies
formed and registered under the companies act one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-six and now,
companies act two thousand and thirteen it includes any company which is formed
and registered under any law relating to the company's
formally inforced any part of india other than jammu and kashmir
this means what that if there was any company which was
previously formed in any part of india it would form to be an
indian company accept any company which was previously
formed in the state of jammu and kashmir also an indian company
includes any corporation established under the central
state or provincial act not only this it also includes any
also various provisions for computation of taxable income,
institution which is declared by the board
central board of direct taxes to be a company last but not the
least any company which is formed under any law which is
enforced in the state of jammu kashmir or any company which is
formed under any law in the union territories of dadra, goa
damon and diu and pondicherry so, this was about indian company
next we will know about foreign company we've learned what an
indian company is now, we will know about foreign company
before knowing about foreign company, we have to know the
meaning of a domestic company only when we learn about the
including a concept called minimum alternate tax
meaning of domestic company, then we know about the meaning
of a foreign company so, what is a domestic company now
domestic company defination covers two limbs
first limb is it says that any indian company is a domestic company
second limb says that it can be any company which in respect of its
income is liable to tax under the it act, which has made
prescribed arrangements for the declaration and payments within
india of the dividends which is payable out of such income
so, what does this mean? first limb is clear that it a domestic
companies an indian company second limbs says that it can be any
to discuss these issues, we have invited ca rachita saraf
company not necessarily an indian company it can be any
company which out of its income, which is liable under the it act
has made prescribed arrangements for the declaration of its
dividend and payment of such dividend within india also, it
means that such dividend will be payable from the income which is
generated and liable to the income tax act so, this is the
definition of a domestic company now, we come to the
meaning of foreign company so, any company which is not a
domestic company becomes a foreign company automatically
now, another company which is which i think you have
to this program and ca rachita saraf
heard about is an industrial company so, what is an
industrial company, it is any company which is mainly engaged
in the business of generation, or distribution of electricity,
or any other form of power, or in the construction of ships or
in the manufacturer processing of any goods or in the business of mining
so, any company is engaged in these businesses that
i've just mentioned, will be an industrial company now, when i
say that a company is an industrial company doesn't
necessarily mean that the company should be engaged only
in the prescribed businesses that i've mentioned it can also
has done her graduation from st xavier's college, kolkata
have other businesses, but to it for it to become an industrial company
the total income of such business of the previous
year from the businesses listed above should not be less than
fifty-one percent of its total income so if all those businesses that i
mentioned like business of generation of distribution of
power of electricity or construction of ships or
manufacture processing of goods or mining should constitute at
least fifty percent of the total income of the company
and hence it will be known as the industrial company
and completed her chartered accountancy in two thousand and sixteen
she is in the independent practice for last two years
next we will know about a company in which the public are
government or rbi any company in which not less than forty percent of
the shares in value are held by the government or rbi
number two, section twenty-five company what is section twenty-five company?
these are those companies which are made solely for the promotion of
commerce, art, religion, science or charity so, any section twenty-five
company will also be regarded as a company in which the public are
substantially interested third any company without to share
capital is a company in which public has substantially
invested number four, nidhi or mutual benefit company
what is an nidhi or mutual benefit company
substantially interested what does this mean?
it is any company who is in the business of
acceptance of deposit from its members
this was number four number five company which is owned by
cooperative society number six, any listed company and number
seven, public limited company which is owned by the government
and or is a widely held company so, all these seven cases or any
of these seven cases will be deemed to be a company in which
the public are substantially interested
next is investment company
what is an investment company a company in which,
section two ( 18) defines a company in which public are
whose gross total income consists mainly of income from
house property, capital gains and income from other sources
so any company which has its gross total income from these three
sources of income will be deemed to be an investment company
next is widely held company we've just learned the meaning
of a company in which public or substantially interested so,
widely held company is a company in which the public are
substantially interested and the last definition under
companies is a closely held company so any company in which
the public are not substantially interested is known as a closely held company
substantially interested so the following cases that i will
so these were the different types of companies
that we just learned about
thank you ca saraf for highlighting various types of companies
now we have learned the different types of companies, including a
domestic company, a foreign company, an investment company
section twenty-five company, closely held companies etc now we wish to
learn that how the taxable income of a company is
calculated, and what is the procedure for
computation of its tax liability
okay, let's move forward to understanding the computation of
mention right now, seven cases i'm going to mention if these
taxable income and tax liability of companies so there are six
steps involved in arriving at the taxable income and tax
liability of a company step one, first you have to ascertaining
income under different heads of income, like house property,
business, professional, capital gains, other sources etc
this constitutes your step one, step two talks about income of other
persons, which may be included in the income of the company
under section sixty and sixty-one so there are various clubbing
provisions due to which the income of many other people may
be included as the income of the company so you have to include
cases are there, then it will be regarded as a company in which
that after including other income from different heads
this is step two let's go to step three, which talks about
you about us taking the current and brought forward losses,
which should be adjusted against the income of the company
step four, we arrive at the step four, add the resulting figure,
which is the cross total income so what is your gross total
income, you add all the income from various sources, and heads
of income in step one, in the on that figure you add step two
figure of any income of any other person which may be
included in the income of the company step three, you
public are substantially interested first, if does
subtract and adjust any current or brought forward losses
this then leads us to arrive at step four, which is called the gross
total income now, at step five, what you do is from step four,
you deduct all the permissible sections from section sixty to sixty u
and we come at the last step, which is step six, which
is the resulting sum, which is gross total income minus all the
deductions is the net income on which you tax
income tax at the applicable rate in force
so, this is how we arrive at the taxable income
and tax liability of a company
any company which is owned by the government or rbi, it will
be deemed to be a company in which public are substantially interested
now, what is a company which is owned by the
so thank you for giving a detailed step by step analysis of
any ten consecutive years to claim the deduction and
deduction will be hundred percent of the profit for these
ten consecutive years however, there's only one thing that you
have to keep in mind that the assessee should start operation
on or after april one one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five but before april one two thousand and seventeen
so this was about case one, under eighty ia
let's move to case two case two under eighty ia talks about
telecommunication services so, any undertaking who is engaged in
providing any telecommunication services now, what is
telecommunication services? it includes providing any services,
company can avail to minimize its tax liability?
whether basic or cellular, including radio paging, domestic
satellite service or network of trunking or broadband network
and internet services and electronic data interchange
service at anytime after march thirty-one one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five but before march
thirty-one two thousand and five this is covering telecommunication services
now, what is the reduction under case two, which covers
telecommunication services the deduction should be claimed
as hundred percent of the profits in the first five years and thirty percent
of the profits in the next five years again this span of
ten years, where we came hundred percent for the first five years
you're right sir, not all deductions are available to companies that
and thirty percent of the profits in the next five years should be within
a span of fifteen years from the previous year in which the
undertaking begins providing telecommunication services
also, this enterprise that is engaged in providing
telecommunication services should be a new enterprise and
only can you then claim deduction under eighty ia
till now we've learned about case one and case two under eighty ia
let's move forward to learning about case three case three and the eighty ia talks about
industrial parks so any assessee who develops
or develops and maintains or maintains
different deductions which have been made which are available to
and operates an industrial park
or a special economic zone
as sez will be able to claim deduction under eighty ia
now to claim deduction under eighty ia under case three for industrial parks,
it has to start operating during april one two thousand and seven and march thirty-one two thousand and eleven
for the industrial park and it should start operation during
april one one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven and march thirty-one two thousand and five foreign sez unit
now, what will be a deduction a deduction will be hundred
percent of the profit, which will be deductable for ten years,
commencing from the initial years, but it should fall within
individuals, huf firms and companies so in this section but will do
fifteen years from the start of the previous year in which the
undertaking begins operating or developing industrial park
this was all about case three
let's move forward to case four case four talks
about power generation, transmission and distribution
or substantial renovation and modernization of existing distribution lines
for this, you have to have an undertaking which should be set up in
any part of india for the generation and distribution of power
and this should be done during april one one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three and march thirty-one two thousand and seventeen
only if you fulfill these criterias will you get a deduction under eighty ia
is we will only talk about those sections on which company can
under case four now, this again the enterprise should be a new
undertaking and here the deductions will be same as that
we discussed in case three
last but not the least, is case five
case five talks about undertaking setup for the reconstruction of power unit
here, it should be an assessee who should own an indian company
and setup should be for deconstruction or renewal of a power generating plant
now such undertaking should begin generation or transmission or
distribution of power before march thirty-one two thousand and eleven the only thing
under the section left to discuss is what will be the deduction
claim deduction so let's begin with that first we're going to
for case five deduction will be same as a
deduction which is discussed under case one under eighty ia
so we've done with understanding eighty ia eighty ia covers
five cases, and any company forming part of any of these
cases can claim deduction under eighty ia
next section is also very important
this section is eighty iab
and this section talks about profits and gains of industrial undertakings
which are engaged in the development of special economic
zone of sez so, who can claim deduction under this section?
know about section eighty g what a section eighty g it talks about
any taxpayer who is a developer of sez can claim
deduction, the development of the sez should begin on or
before march thirty-one two thousand and seventeen and if you fulfill these criteria, then
you can claim a deduction of one hundred percent of the profits for ten
consecutive years, falling within fifteen years beginning from
the year in which the sez has been notified by the central government
small section, easy section but an important section
let's go to the next section which is eighty iac
eighty iac talks about profits and gains derived from eligible startup
under this section, any assessee who can claim a deduction but who should
donations to charitable institutions and funds
be this assessee it can be only a company or an llp,
who is engaged in the eligible business now, what is an
eligible business under this section eligible business would
mean a business which is involves innovation,
development, deployment or commercialization of
new products, processes or services, which is given by
technology or intellectual property so, these are these
things, which cover the meaning of eligible business under this
section so any company or llp was engaged in any of these
eligible business can claim deduction under eighty iac
now, who can claim this deduction? any tax payer can claim this
the only condition is that such company or llp should be
incorporated after march thirty-one two thousand and sixteen but before april one two thousand and nineteen
and the annual business turnover such company or llp does
not exceed twenty-five crore in any of the five previous years,
beginning from april one two thousand and sixteen if all these conditions are
fulfilled, then the assessee can claim deduction of hundred
percent of the profit and gains from the business for five
consecutive years beginning from the year in which the eligible
startup is incorporated next section is eighty ib like we have
done earlier, eighty ia which talks about five cases you're also
deduction so not only a company but any taxpayer can claim
computation of income of companies so, the details will
will talk about eighty ib; eighty ib however, has eleven cases under this
now what does eighty ib cover eighty ib talks about
profits and gains of industrial undertakings,
other than infrastructure development undertakings so eighty ia talks
about profits and gains of industrial development
undertakings and various cases under that and eighty ib talks
about profit and gains of industrial undertakings
other then infrastructure development undertakings
so what are the cases that it covers?
it covers eleven cases as i said let's talk about the cases
deduction under eighty g now, any donation which is made
case one is business of industrial undertaking
case two talks about operation of ship
case three talks about hotels case four talks about industrial research
case five is for production of mineral oil
case six is for developing and building housing projects
case seven is about the business of processing and preservation
and also packaging of fruits and vegetables are integrated
handling storage and transportation of food grains items
this is case seven case eight talks about multiplex theaters
case nine talks about conviction centers
to a national defence fund, or jawaharlal nehru memorial fund,
case ten talks about operating and maintaining a
hospital in rural area and last but not the least,
case eleven talks about hospitals located in certain specified areas
now, let's go into each case separately
let me first mention that case two,
eight and nine, they are not eligible for deduction
now days they have been removed and are not practically
applicable now days, clear now, let's go back to case one
under case one, any assessee or company who wants to claim
deduction should be a new undertaking and should
or prime minister's drought relief fund or prime minister's
manufacture produce articles also it should employed ten
workers, when the manufacturing process is carried on with the
aid of power and twenty workers if the manufacturing processes sky down
without the aid of power if it fulfills such conditions
then the amount of deduction is hundred percent of the profits
for the first five years and thirty percent for the next five years
but in case of a small scale industrial undertaking, the deduction will
be thirty percent for ten years this was case, one under eighty ib
let's talk about case three i said two is not applicable
so we'll jump to case three
national relief fund and other many such funds are there which
case three talks about certain hotels, which talks about
deduction for ten year limit and this limit was only
till assessment year ten - eleven this is all about case three
let's move to case four case four talks about deduction of hundred
percent of profit for the first five years if the prescribed
authority approves the company before april one one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine
and ten years if it approves after march thirty-one two thousand and two but before april one two thousand and seven
so case four talks about two deduction slabs, one where
hundred percent deduction will be for five years
and another one one hundred percent deduction will be for ten years depending on the
is listed by the government, if you make donation to any such
date just set let's go forward let's move to case five
case five says that there will be deduction
of hundred percent of the profits for the first seven
years only the thing that you have to keep in mind is that the
company should be a new undertaking and it can be
located anywhere in india next is case six
case six talks about the building area
it says that the building area of each
residential unit should not be more than one thousand, five hundred square feet
but for places like delhi and mumbai it should be thousand square feet
fund, then you can claim a deduction what is the amount of
also one residential unit should be allotted to one person
and also not to his spouse or children or huf
if all these conditions are fulfilled under case six,
then the deduction is hundred percent of the profit
case seven is next under case seven deduction is hundred percent for the
first five years and thirty percent for the next five years
eight and nine, as i've already mentioned, is not applicable now days
so, we will move to case ten under case ten
you have to fulfill certain criterias to claim deduction
here hospital should have at least one hundred beds for patients
deduction it is hundred percent or fifty %, as the case may be,
and the hospital should be constructed between
october one two thousand and four and march thirty-one two thousand and eight
if this condition is fulfilled, then the deduction will be hundred percent
of the profit for the first five years last case that we are moving to is case eleven
and we'll be done with section eighty ib
what does case eleven say?
case eleven says that you will get hundred percent deduction for
the first five years, if the hospitals are situated anywhere
in india, other than delhi, mumbai, kolkata, chennai,
hyderabad, bangalore, gurgaon etc so, it to claim deduction
depending on the fund that you've given the donation to
under case eleven the hospital should be situated in any place
other than these places that i have just mentioned
so, with this we are done with eighty ib
you will get the deduction automatically and accordingly of
one hundred percent or fifty percent now, the next question that you may come
also be available in the e-text to learners please refer to the
up with is, what is the mode of payment of such donation that
you've made now, the donation could be made earlier in cash or
by cheque or draft but however, no deduction will be allowed for
an amount exceeding ten thousand in cash from assessment year thirteen - fourteen to
assessment year seventeen - eighteen and above rupees two thousand from assessment year
eighteen - nineteen so these are the key points that you have to remember
under eighty g in order to claim deduction next section is eighty gga
which talks about donation to scientific research or rural development
who can claim in deduction
any assessee can claim a deduction under this section except an
e-text and also we'll try to do one comprehensive problem on this issue
assessee, whose income is chargeable under pgbp
and is entitled to claim this deduction in respect of payments or
donations for scientific research or rural development
therefore, what does this mean? it means any assessees can claim the
deduction for donations made for scientific research or rural
development excepting those assessees whose income is
chargeable under pgbp you're also mode of payment can be cash
or cheque or draft, but for cash contribution exceeding ten thousand
it will be disallowed from assessment year thirteen - fourteen
next is eighty ggb eighty ggb talks about contribution to political parties
so, we have seen how gross total income of a company is calculated
now, what all are covered under eighty ggb
any contribution that you make to political party is deductable
under this section if the contribution is made by an
indian company, here it cannot be any company only an indian
company can claim deduction under eighty ggb mainly all the
sections that we are going to talk about is only for
companies this specific section is for an indian companies
specifically, yes now, any expenditure if you made by way
of advertisement to a magazine, which is owned by a political
party will also be treated as contribution to a political party
now we know that from gross total income, a lot of
now, deduction the section is not available to any
local authority or any artificial judicial person
wholly or partly funded by the government also, from
assessment year fourteen - fifteen no deduction will be allowed for
any contribution which is paid in cash that means from assesment year
fourteen - fifteen any contribution which is made to any political
party has to be by cheque or draft
now next section is eighty ia eighty ia is a vast section it talks
about profit and gains of industrial undertakings which
are engaged in infrastructure facilities under the section there
deductions are available under section eighty c to eighty u
are various cases we'll do and we'll talk about each case specifically
so let's begin with this section
case one, under eighty ia is provision for infrastructure facility
any enterprise which carries on the business of developing
or maintaining and operating or developing maintaining and
operating of infrastructure facility can claim deduction under eighty ia
now the first question which arises is what is an infrastructure facility
so, we should know the meaning of infrastructure facility
so, infrastructure facility means any road which
includes any toll road, bridge or rail system it also includes a
but many of the sections are not available to companies like eighty c
highway project, including housing or other activity being
an integral part of that highway project also, infrastructure
facility will include water supply project water treatment system,
irrigation, project sanitation and sewerage system
or solid waist management system
last but not the least, infrastructure facility will
also include any port or airport or inland waterway or inland
port or navigational channel in the sea
so, this is the meaning of infrastructure facility
now, under case one, what is the amount of deduction that comes
is available only to individual and huf so now we are
into your mind so, the amount of deduction will be hundred
percent of the profit which is deductible in ten consecutive
years, which should fall within fifteen years beginning with the
assessment year in which the assessee begins operating and
maintaining the infrastructure facility this means what ? it
means that an assessee is engaged in the business of
infrastructure facility the year from which he begins this
infrastructure facility operating or maintaining
whichever the case may be from that you will take a timespan of
fifteen years and within those fifteen years, the assessee can choose
interested to know from you that what are the deductions which a
now, you have discussed the section eighty various provisions in detail
highlighted the carry forward and set of provisions and the
discussions and example which we have done on carry forward and
set of provisions we think that learners should have a very,
fairly good idea about the of computation of
income and tax liability of companies
thank you very much for coming
and we hope that we will get again your insights in the future episodes
definately
even under eighty c to eighty u now, there are companies who have
taken full advantages of tax exemption, tax deductions,
and then it some companies we call it ztc zero tax companies
these companies show a positive book profit but because of availing
of various sections given under the income tax act, that taxable profit is zero
the finance act one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven first introduced the
concept called minimum alternate tax and when p chidambaram was
the finance minister in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven - ninety-eight he introduced a under section fifteen ja
whereby a percentage of book profit is treated as taxable profit
so now i request you to just elaborate on this
so learners have now a wide idea about what are the
particular term, minimum alternate tax
definitely sir, minimum alternate tax is also called matt
let's first understand how tax liability is computed under
normal provisions, and then we will understand how
it is computed under matt
so, computation one is under normal provisions under normal
provisions, we'll talk about seven steps of competition
step one talks about taxable income, which is arrived at under normal provisions
step two is a income tax that you charge at the rate of thirty percent
in case it is a foreign company, then the slab is forty percent
deductions that can be claimed from the gross total income
step three talks about surcharge, if any has which has
to be added to the rate of thirty percent step four, talks about step two
plus step three next is step five, which is hecc or cess
which is at the rate of four %, which we will add on step four amount
next is step six, which talks about the tax rebate under
section eighty-six ninety ninety a and ninety-one and finally, arrive at step seven,
which is step four, plus step five minus step six, which is the
tax which is payable and this figure can not be negative
so under normal computation and normal provisions, we have done step seven
so we have done from step one till step seven let's move to
besides section ten also gives some kind of exemptions which
computation under matt under matt we will start with step eight
and index step thirteen step eight says what it says that you have to
find the book profit under mat now what is book profit
when we make the pl for a company profit and loss account, we arrive at a
net profit, mat list down certain additions and subtractions that
you have to do on the net profit to arrive at the book profit
so step eight talks about arriving at the book profit
under the mat provisions which is given in the law
next is step nine, which says that you have to
apply the rate of eighteen five percent of tax on the book
are exempted abinitio that they do not form part of gross
profit that you've arrived at step eight next is step ten
in which, similar to step three, you add surcharge in step ten
step eleven is then finding out the total amount, which is step nine
plus step ten step twelve here next step corresponds to step five of the normal
computation under normal provisions,
which is adding the shec and ec cess, which is four percent on step eleven
and then the normal provisions under step five, with added
cess on step four, similarly, here on step twelve we will add
cess at the rate four percent on step eleven after step twelve we arrive at step thirteen
which is the step which is a final step for mat computation,
total income but once it is included in gross total income,
which is step eleven plus step twelve so, this is a computation of
tax liability under both provisions which you have to do for any company
so while you calculating your tax liability,
you will arrive at step seven also for the same company and arrive
at step thirteen for the same company and the tax liability of that
company will be step seven or step thirteen whichever is more
therefore, mat under one hundred and fifteen jb will be applicable if the tax
liability of a company under normal provision is lower than
eighteen five percent of the book profit and what will be the effect of this
applicability of mat effect will be that the book profit shall be
the deductions can be avail from under section eighty c to eighty u
deemed to be the total income and eighteen five percent of the book profit
should be deemed as the tax liability now, this was all
about mat and one hundred and fifteen jb but they're exception to mat provisions
three main exceptions to mat provision are
as follows: number one, the income of a shipping company
subject to the provision of 'tonnage income' and not under mat
number two, income which accrues and arises to a company
from life insurance business would be referred to in section
one hundred and fifteen b and not one hundred and fifteen jb and final in case of a foreign company,
whether its total income comprises solely of profits and
and ca rachita saraf has already discussed in detail the
gains referred to in sections forty-four b, forty-four bb, forty-four bba and forty-four bbb
those sections which applicable to a foreign
company, such cases will not be applicable to mat so, these
were the exceptions for mat last topic under mat is carry
forward and set of tax credit it says that the amount of tax
which is in excess of step thirteen over step seven will be carried
forward and set off in future years when tax becomes payable
under the normal provisions here the time limit for carry forward
of tax credit under section one hundred and fifteen jb is ten years, up to assessment
year two thousand and seventeen - eighteen which has been enhanced to fifteen years from
various sections and learners should advise the clients as
assessment year two thousand and eighteen - nineteen i hope you understood the provisions of mat
this was all about mat versus normal computation
so, it was a very interesting discussion on a complex topic of
computation of income from companies we have learned that
how income is computed for companies, what are the
different provisions and what are the sections that is
deductions that can be claimed under different sections of eighty c
and eighty u, as well as ca rachita saraf has also given a
glimpse of the minimum alternate tax that is when the tax is
charged, even if the taxable profit is zero and she has also
well as they can also take advantage of various sections,
some of the provisions for revisions of the assessment of
assessment order by the income tax authorities so, you
welcome ca rajkumar nahata, to this week discussion on appeals
and revisions as you are in the practice for last twenty years
so you are very much conversant with the process of appeals and revisions
but before i hand it over on discussion for appeals
and revisions, can you just give a briefing on who are
the income tax authorities that normally come into the picture
for income tax administration
welcome learners once again i'm here, so
welcome learners welcome to the discussion on appeals and revisions
today we will discuss about appeals and revisions
so appeal as we everyone know what is an appeal and we will learn
later on in details so, income tax authorities, the apex
body is the cbdt central board of direct taxes which is formed by
the government so the central board of direct taxes is the
apex body amongst income tax authority
so below them we have principal chief commissioner of income tax or
principal director general of income tax so, then we have
chief commissioner of income tax or director general of income tax
so they are in cbdt then we have some ccit or
remember on week ten we have learned the process of filing of return
principle ccit or principal director general of
income tax, say for the entire any region we have one principal
chief commissioner so, likewise for northern region or region
wise we have principal ccits or principal dgits
they are followed by chief commissioner of income tax or director
general of income tax so, under one principal ccit, there might
be three four five six seven ten ccits, chief commissioner of income tax
so again, below the principal ccits we have commission
income tax or additional director general or director of income tax
so again, there they are also given different
and the assessment we have ca rajkumar nahata, very nicely
charges, cit assessment, cit appeals or cit administration,
cit revenue, cit audit, cit and vision
so they are given charges of different wings of the
income tax department so then we below the commissioners
of income tax, we have additional commissioner of
income tax or we also say them as additional director of income
tax followed by joint commissioner of income tax or joint director
of income tax so, from joint commissioner of income tax,
till the line till the down the line we go they are the
assessing officers basically the assessment part is being done by
elaborated the provisions to us today, we have invited him again
this category, joint commissioner or below joint commissioner so
as per the action plan, sometimes as per the action plan,
even joint commissioners, they don't go for scrutiny or they
are not allowed to do scrutiny or assessment procedures and all those things
so their department comes out with an action plan every year
again, below joint commissioners, we
have deputy commissioners of income tax, or you say deputy
director of income tax then we have assistant commissioners of
income tax or assistant director of income tax
then we have income tax officers
for a discussion on appeals and revisions
so income tax officers under the and income tax officers
and tax recovery officers they are on the same
income tax officers and tax recovery
officers and below them we have inspectors
so this is the complete hierarchy of income tax authorities
let me summarize the discussions which you have made so far
so if i understand correctly, or if i'm wrong,
please correct me in my discussion
so in the top there is this central board of
direct taxes, which is the apex authority or
today in this week discussion, we will be learning
administration of income tax in india then as far as the normal
operatives are concerned, the head is the principal chief
commissioner of income tax, or principal director general of
income tax next is the chief commissioner of income tax
or director general of income tax, followed by principal
commissioner of income tax, or additional director general or
principal director of income tax then comes the commissioner
of income tax or additional director general or director of
income tax and then is the additional direct commissioners
of income tax or additional director of income tax
various things on appeals made by the assessee
and as you have already told the assessing power comes from the
joint commissioner and down below
there may doing assessment process
so they are the joint commissioner of income tax or
joint director of income tax then comes the deputy
commissioner of income tax or deputy director of income tax,
then comes the assistant commissioner of income tax or
assistant director of income tax, and followed by our
neighborhood officers on itos where the income tax officers
and at the same footing they are also tax recovery officers
if he or she is not satisfied with the order of the assessing officer
and lastly, the income tax inspectors so this is the total
hierarchy of income tax authorities
and at the same time we will also learn
how to minimize tax liability legally
welcome learners as sarkar sir correctly said, tax planning is
the arrangement of one's financial and economic affairs
by taking complete legitimate benefits of all the deductions,
exemptions, allowances and rebates so that the tax
liability is reduced to minimum thus, tax planning involves
moving around the laws in a legal way and availing all the
deduction exemptions and allowances to reduce your tax liability
let's understand this with an example
so, for example, for the assessment there eighteen nineteen the gross total
welcome learners the last week of discussion that is tax planning
income of a person say x is rupees one million, two hundred and ninety thousand and tax on
one hundred and twenty-nine thousand is two lakh five thousand, four hundred and ninety rupees to reduce his tax
liability it deposits rupees two hundred and fifty thousand in ppf account
and therefore, his taxable income and tax liability reduces to
rupees eleven lakh forty thousand and rupees one lakh fifty-nine thousand, one hundred and forty respectively
therefore, this is tax planning
also, when you know about tax planning
that two other concepts that you should be aware of
one is tax avoidance and the other tax evasion
let's start with tax evasion what is tax evasion?
in all our previous discussions, we have tried to
tax evasion is using all methods by which tax liablities is illegally avoided
so tax evasion is not recommended because this is
illegal and punishable let me give you an example
suppose x has a factory in haryana,
which manufactures chemicals
also he has a land of twelve thousand square meter, which is unutilized
within this factory which produces chemicals now x wants
to start a new unit but if the unit is started in the existing
factory campus then the deduction under eighty ib is not available,
because it is available only in jammu and kashmir
give you certain hints or certain tips for tax planning
now, what does x do? suppose he starts production in
haryana but to claim deduction under eighty ib, it takes a factory
building on rent in jammu kashmir and only on paper to
show that the new unit has started in jammu and kashmir
what is this learner? this is tax evasion because this is illegal
i hope you've understood the meaning of tax evasion
let's move to another topic, which is tax avoidance
what is tax avoidance? it is reducing or negating tax
liability in a legally permissible way and has legal sanction
it is not tax evasion, but we never recommend tax avoidance
tax planning is the way to minimize the tax liability of an assessee legally
we always recommend tax planning now an example to
go for tax avoidance is this suppose fifty thousand is gifted by
husband to wife, then the clubbing provisions are applicable
under section sixty-four ( 1), this section is not
applicable, if it is made by the same person out of the funds of
his huf in the capacity as a karta of the family
therefore, if the gift is made by the karta of the family to his wife,
the provisions are not applicable and can be avoided
and tax liability will be reduced this is not illegal
and hence it is tax avoidance i am repeating this again, learners,
today we have invited ca rachita saraf
you should always go for tax planning and not for tax
avoidance or tax evasion
thank you for making clear the concepts of tax evasion, tax
avoidance tax planning so tax evasion is completely a now
no affair where is tax avoidance should not be encouraged
but tax planning is a good way to minimize the things
so the process of tax planning can started from the very beginning,
even when a new business unit is set up,
before setting up or selecting the location etc, the enterpreneur
or the promoters can think for the tax planning
again for a discussion because she is a practicing chartered
can you highlight some of the issues in these that how a business firm
or an entrepreneur or an assessee can think for tax planning in the
beginning of setting up of a business
definitely sir, for tax planning with reference to
setting up of new business you have to consider three main things
one is the location of the new business
second is the nature of the new business
and form of organization of the new business
accountant and she can tell us the legal ways to minimize tax liability
so we welcome you, madam thank you, and just request
you to tell us certain tips about the tax planning
of a capital asset effected in the previous year will be
chargeable to tax under the head capital gains'
such capital gains will be deemed to be the income of the previous year
in which the transfer takes place so, any profit or gains arising
from transfer of a capital asset during the previous year is
chargeable to tax under the head "capital gains" immediately
following the assessment year , this will be taxable if
such gains is not exempted or not eligible for exemption under
, if we analyze section forty-five
welcome learners welcome to the discussion of capital gains
then we will find that there are five conditions
condition number one, that there should be a capital asset
condition number two, the capital asset is transferred by the assessee,
condition number three such transfer takes place during the previous year
condition number four, any profit or gain arises as a result of transfer
,mind it the term profit or gain also includes negative profit or
gain or in other words it is loss, and condition number five
such profit or gain is not exempt under section five thousand, four hundred and fifty-four b, fifty-four d,
five conditions, which must be fulfilled for any income to come
this week we'll be learning section forty-five to section fifty-five of the
under the head capital gains will we see one by one,
that the important term is capital asset and second important term is transferred
what is a capital asset?
according to section two ( 14), a capital asset means
(a) property of any kind held by an assessee, whether or not connected with
his business or profession; or secondly,any securities held
by foreign institutional investors which has invested in
such securities in accordance with the sebi regulation
to make it more clear capital asset does not include number one
stock- in trade: that is any stock in trade, other than the
income tax act, which deals with the head of income capital gains
securities which we have already discussed or consumable stores
or raw materials held for the purpose of business or
profession of the assessee; and secondly, personnel effects,
personnel effect that is to say, movable property, such as
including wearing apparel and furniture held for personal use
by the asseessee or any member of his family dependent on him
but remember, archaeological collections, drawings,
paintings, sculpture; or any work of art, even if these are
personnel effects, these will be treated as capital asset
and transfer of such assets will attract capital gains tax
when the assessee earns income by way of transfer of a
capital gain asset does not include rural agricultural land
that is agricultural land in india i e , which is not situated in
any of the specified area that is the population of ten thousand or
more or it is in a cantonment board or municipal area
and also capital asset will not include specified gold bonds,
six and a half percent gold bonds, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven or seven percent gold bonds, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty national
defence gold bonds, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty issued by central government;
special bearer bonds, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one issued by the central government;
and also capital asset will not include gold deposit bonds
issued under the gold deposit scheme, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine or deposit
capital asset, then the gains or loss is chargeable under the
certificate under the gold monetization scheme, two thousand and fifteen
notified by central government otherwise, all assets will be
treated as capital assets so, repeat capital asset includes
almost all assets all property, but which is held by the assessee
whether or not connected with business or
professional including securities, but will not include
stock in trade, will not include personnel effects, will not
include rural agricultural land and will not include specified
gold bonds or gold deposit bonds
head capital gains so we will devote this session on learning
how income tax is charged on capital gains section forty-five of the
income tax act deals with chargeability section forty-five
provides that any profits or gains arising from the transfer
, the important term is that capital assets
more than thirty-six months, it will be treated as long term capital asset
however, a security other than a unit listed in a recognized
stock exchange or a unit of equity oriented fund or a unit
of unit trust of india or a zero coupon bond will be considered
as a long term capital asset if the same is held for more than
twelve months immediately preceding the previous year
or the year of its transfer that means, in case of other assets it is thirty-six months,
in case of listed equity shares or listed security or unit it is twelve months
now, period of holding of unlisted share to
qualify as a long term capital asset is that a share of a
it can be categorized or classified under two heads,
company not being a share listed in a recognized stock exchange
would be treated as short term capital asset, if it was held by
an assessee for not more than twenty-four months immediately preceeding the
date of its transfer thus, the period of holding of such
unlisted shares for being treated as long term capital asset would
be more than twenty-four months instead of thirty-six months or in case of
listed it is twelve months , there is another change from the
assessment year two thousand and eighteen - nineteen that period of holding of an
immovable property, being land or building or both
, an immovable property being land or building or both would be
short term capital asset and long term capital asset section two ( forty-two a)
treated as a short term capital asset if it was held by an
assessee for not more than twenty-four months, immediately preceeding
the date of its transfer thus, the period of holding of
immovable property, being land or building or both, for being
treated as a long term capital asset has been reduced from more
than thirty-six months to more than twenty-four months from assessment year two thousand and eighteen - nineteen
, what do we get is that there are for short term
and long term the cutoff is thirty-six months that is normally an asset,
if it is held for more than thirty-six months, it would be treated as
long term capital asset, otherwise it is treated as short
defines short term capital asset as a asset held by an
term capital asset with the exception of
listed securities, where instead of thirty-six months, it is twelve months,
for unlisted securities, instead of thirty-six months, it is twenty-four months
and in case of immovable property, instead of thirty-six months,
it would be twenty-four months , let's see the meaning of transfer
section two ( 47) defines transfer
in relation to a capital asset which includes different types of transactions
it includes the sale, exchange or
relinquishment of the rights in the assets
of extinguishment of any rights or the compulsory acquisition
assessee not more than thirty-six months immediately preceeding the date of its transfer
thereof under any law
convert the same into stock in trade into a business in case of
a maturity or redemption of a zero coupon bond
, in this way, all this definition or all these
transactions will be treated as transferred
, in case of section forty-five deals the scope of and the year of chargeability
there are certain provisions, there are
certain insurance receipts, conversion of treatment of
capital gains, etc treated as, it comes under this scope of that particular asset section
therefore, a capital asset held by an assessee for
, in case of capital gains, there are
certain specific cases that is capital gains in case of
distribution of assets by company in liquidation,
capital gains in case of buyback of shares , in all these cases,
the transactions of transfer has certain,
typical characteristics, please read the study materials the e-text,
where we will be discussing this particular points in detail
more than thirty-six months, immediately preceeding the date of its transfer,
is a long term capital asset , the cut off date is thirty-six months
, up to thirty-six months, if the asset is held, it would be
treated as short term capital asset, but if it is held for
coming to section forty-eight that is the mode of computation of capital gains
number b) cost of acquisition number c) cost of improvement
, from full value of consideration, we will deduct three things
number one, expenditure on transfer,
number two cost of acquisition, number three cost of improvement
, from resulting figure, we will deduct exemption provided
under various sections of fifty-four normally four sections are
available for short term capital gains, these are section fifty-four b,
fifty-four d, fifty-four g and fifty-four ga , when from the resultant sum, we
deduct these four sections, the deductions available under these
four sections, we will get the balancing amount as short term capital gain
section forty-eight of the income tax act discusses the
in case of long term capital gain the process is
almost same with some minor difference we have to find out
the full value of consideration, will deduct just like in case of
short term three things here also three number a)
expenditure incurred wholly or exclusively in connection with such transfer
number b) instead of simple cost of acquisition
we'll be using indexed cost of acquisition
number c) indexed cost of improvement
from the result and figure, we'll be giving the deductions
or exemptions available under section fifty-four instead of four here
mode of computation the first criterion is the
seven sections are available section five thousand, four hundred and fifty-four b, fifty-four d, fifty-four ec, fifty-four g,
fifty-four ga and fifty-four gb , when these are deducted, these
exemptions are deducted from resultant figure, we get long
term capital gain , the difference between short term
capital asset and long term capital asset when the tax is
being computed or capital gain is computed in case of short
term capital gain only the simple cost of acquisition
and cost of improvement is deducted but in case of long term capital
gain indexed cost of acquisition and indexed cost of improvement
is given as deduction , in case of long term capital asset
whether the asset is a short term capital asset or long term capital assets
we get the benefit of indexation, that is the cost of
acquisition and cost of improvement is a bit inflated
or more deductions are given because we use the index
however, this indexation benefit are not available in some of the
cases, there are many cases where this indexation benefit is
not available we can only mention here one that is a
depreciable asset, that is, if in any asset depreciation
benefit is being taken by the business over the years,
in that case, that particular asset cannot have indexation benefit
, capital gains tax are also exempt under section ten and
, it depends on the nature of capital asset
under section one hundred and fifteen one hundred and fifteen jg , these deductions may be referred
to in particular sections regarding the inflation,
that is the indexation of the cost of acquisition and cost of improvement
the income tax act has taken two thousand and one - two as the base year
and accordingly the cost inflation index is provided
under the income tax act, where the cii that is the cost
inflation index is provided from two thousand and one - two to the financial year
two thousand and eighteen - nineteen while the cii is one hundred in for the financial year two thousand and one - two
it is two hundred and eighty for two thousand and eighteen - nineteen
, let's see computation of capital gain
transfer in case of short term capital asset, the rule is that
in certain special cases, that is conversion of capital asset
into stock-in-trade computation of capital gains on transfer of
firm's assets to partners and vice versa
compulsory acquisition of an asset in case of non resident in case of self
generated assets, in case of distribution of assets of
companies on liquidation, conversion of debentures into
shares, transfer of security into demat forms, insurance claims received,
purchased by a company of its own shares or securities,
transport of stock option or sweat equity
, all these are very interesting cases where we
we have to find out the sale consideration first
the computition of capital gain is very interesting
out of these two we'll be discussing a bit in detail
one is the bonus shares
that is the shares which are given to the shareholders free of cost
if the bonus shares are acquired before first of april, two thousand and one
then we are to take the fair market value of two thousand and one
on first of april two thousand and one as the cost but if the bonus shares are
acquired on after first of april two thousand and one then cost of acquisition
will be taken as zero , the entire bonus shares, if these
have transferred, the sell consideration will be taken as
from the sale consideration, we have to deduct
capital gain same to same in case of right shares
right shares are those shares, which are given to the existing
shareholders at a lower cost , if the right shares are
sold, in that case, we will calculate the sale consideration
and the original shares as the amount actually paid
if the assessee has sold the rights entitlement,
then the cost of acquisition of rights entitlement will be taken as nil
when these rights shares are sold, then the
amount actually paid for right shares will be taken as cost of acquisition
if we say from the other angle, that is the right
number a) expenditure incurred wholly
shares purchased by the person in whose favour the right
entitlement has been renounced for him or her
the purchase price paid to the announcer plus
the amount paid to the company will be the cost of acquisition
we will discuss a problem and an example
whereby this concept will be made clear to you
or exclusively in connection with such transfer
let us discuss problems on bonus shares, and rights shares
hands of mr y cost inflation index for two thousand and one - two is given hundreed
and two thousand and seventeen - eighteen is given as two hundred and seventy-two
let us now compute the capital gains in the hands of
mr x for the assessment year two thousand and eighteen - nineteen
so, there is one thousand original shares,
which are sold at rupees three hundred per share one thousand is three lakh rupees,
we get indexed cost of acquisition, because these
shares already qualify for twenty-four months holding , it is indexed
cost two hundred and seventy-two by one hundred of seventy-five thousand this cost is becoming two hundred and four thousand
, we get the long term capital gain of ninety-six thousand
bonus share is to be taken as the fair market value as on first of april two thousand and one
from the sale of one thousand original shares
regarding two hundred right shares, which were given
in the month of august two thousand and seventeen , which has not been
hold for more than twenty-four months mind it
this company is a unlisted company
, to be eligible for long term capital asset,
the shares must be held for a minimum period of twenty-four
months, which is not qualified here , here indexed cost of
acquisition will not be allowed the sale proceeds of two hundred shares
into rupees three hundreed sixty thousand simple cost of acquisition of
and if bonus shares are received by the shareholders
rupees one hundred and sixteen into two hundred is thirty-two thousand , you get a short term capital gain of
rupees twenty-eight thousand same will be the case of sale of right
entitlement which is another kind of gain to him sale
proceeds at the rate of rupees thirty-four for two hundred rights entitlement is
six thousand rupees cost of acquisition is taken as nil in such cases
, short term capital gain here also is rupees six thousand
, total capital gain of mr x from one thousand original shares from two hundred rights
shares and sale of right entitlement is rupees ninety-six thousand
long term capital gain and rupees twenty-eight thousand and six thousand is short
term capital gain , ninety-six thousand is long term capital gain, while
after first of april two thousand and one then the cost of acquisition will be taken as nill
thirty-four thousand is short term capital gain , we have already told
you that since the holding period of these shares is less
than twenty-four months, they are short term capital assets hence cost
of acquisition will not be indexed the cost of rights
renounced in favor of another person for the consideration is
taken to be nil the consideration so received is
taxed at short-term capital gain in full the period of holding is
taken from the date of rights offered to the date of renouncement
, let's see the computation of capital gains in
the hands of mr y for the assesment year two thousand and eighteen - nineteen
in case of right shares
mr y is who purchased the right entitlement from mr x
, for two hundred shares, that is mr x has sold the shares and the sale
proceeds which he gets is two hundred into two hundred and eighty is rupees fifty-six thousand
, mr x, mr y is getting fifty-six thousand as sale proceeds
cost of acquisition for two hundred shares is that rupees thirty was paid to mr x
as right entitlement and rupees one hundred and sixty is paid to the company ,
total is one hundred and ninety per shares , one hundred and ninety into two hundred shares is thirty-eight thousand
, in this case also is unlisted shares , short term capital
gain will be rupees eighteen thousand , since the cost of rights is the
amount paid to paid by mr y as well as the amount paid to the company
the cost of acquisition will be the amount paid
since the holding period of these shares is less than twenty-four months,
they are short term capital assets
by the shareholder to the company against the right shares
in case of right shares, the existing shareholder has got
an option to renounce the rights renouncing the rights
means that the right shares are sold to some other person for a
price, then that renouncing amount is also a gain for the existing shareholder
before i go to the problems, let us clear the concepts of bonus
, let me discuss one problem on bonus shares
ms asha purchases one thousand equity shares in x ltd ,
at a cost of rupees thirty per share brokerage one percent and she
purchased it in january one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six she gets hundred bonus shares
in august two thousand she again gets one thousand, one hundred bonus shares by virtue of
her holding on february two thousand and six fair market value of the shares of x ltd
on april one two thousand and one is rupees eighty
in january two thousand and eighteen she transfers all shares at rupees
two hundred per share, brokerage paid two percent , we have to compute the
capital gains taxable in the hands of ms asha
shares as well as rights shares bonus shares are those shares,
for the assessment year two thousand and eighteen - nineteen given the cost inflation index for
financial year two thousand and one - two as hundreed financial year two thousand and five - six as one hundred and seventeen
and financial year two thousand and seventeen - eighteen as two hundred and seventy-two
let us go to the solution if we see the problem,
then we'll find that original shares were purchased in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six
in january one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six and ms asha got hundred bonus shares in
august two thousand one thousand, one hundred bonus shares in february two thousand and six and the question
says that she transfers all the shares in january two thousand and eighteen
if we see at this moment, asha has got one thousand original shares
and one thousand, one hundred bonus shares out of one thousand, one hundred bonus shares hundred bonus shares were
which are given by a company to its existing shareholders free of cost
received prior first of april two thousand and one and one thousand, one hundred bonus shares were
received after first of april two thousand and one
, we have to calculate the capital gains under different heads
will first see the gains or loss for one thousand original shares
for sale proceeds of one thousand original shares,
she sold it for rupees two hundred per share,so it is two lakh rupees,
brokerage paid is two percent that is two percent of rupees two lakh it is four thousand
net sale consideration therefore, is one hundred and ninety-six thousand
, it's the listed company shares , twelve months holding
will be sufficient to get the eligibility for long term capital asset
while right shares are those shares, which are given to
in case of long term capital asset indexation
benefit can be claimed , thus the indexed cost of
acquisition will be deducted indexed cost of acquisition is two hundred and seventy-two by one hundred
and it's cost of acquisition was eighty per share, it is one thousand
, rupees eighty into one thousand number of shares into cii that is the
cost of inflation index two hundred and seventy-two by one hundred , the cost of acquisition when
we indexed it, it becomes two hundred and seventeen thousand, six hundred , when we deduct
it from the net sale consideration,
we get long term capital loss of twenty-one thousand, six hundred
this is for the one thousand original shares regarding hundred bonus
the existing shareholders, not free, but at a price which is a
shares we have to calculate it separately because the one first
of april two thousand and one is the cutoff date hundred bonus shares were
received prior first of april two thousand and one the sale proceeds of one hundred
bonus shares at the rate of rupees two hundred is twenty thousand
brokerage rupees four hundred , net sale consideration is nineteen thousand, six hundred
indexed cost of acquisition will be rupees one hundred
that is the fair market value on first of april two thousand and one
into rupees eighty is the fair market value
on first of april two thousand and one and hundred is the number of shares
, rupees eighty into hundred into cost of acquisition
bit lower than the market price , in both the cases,
two hundred and seventy-two by one hundred we get cost of acquisition as twenty-one thousand, seven hundred and sixty
, you get long term capital loss of rupees two thousand, one hundred and sixty from one hundred bonus shares
regarding one thousand, one hundred bonus shares which were received
after first of april two thousand and one sale proceeds is rupees two hundred
per share , one thousand, one hundred is two hundred and twenty thousand ,brokerage is rupees four thousand, four hundred
, our net sale consideration is two hundred and fifteen thousand, six hundred
here the cost of acquisition will be taken as nill
, the entire net sale consideration of rupees two hundred and fifteen thousand, six hundred
is to be taken as long term capital gain
, if we calculate the total the
the existing shareholders get benefit from the company in case
income from capital gains, so, the long term capital gain,
there was a loss in a loss in b, but there is a capital gain is c
, ultimately it would be one hundred and ninety-one thousand, eight hundred and forty
there is a a there was a loss from sale of one thousand original
shares of twenty-one thousand, six hundred there is a loss of hundred bonus shares,
that is two thousand, one hundred and sixty but there was a capital gain of rupees two hundred and fifteen thousand, six hundred
from one thousand, one hundred bonus shares , ultimately the long term capital
gain will be rupees one hundred and ninety-one thousand, eight hundred and forty
let's see another problem on right shares
mr x holds one thousand shares in star ltd , which is an unlisted
of bonus shares, the income tax rule says that if the bonus
company, which is acquired in the year two thousand and one - two at a cost of rupees seventy-five thousand he
has been offered right shares by the company in
the month of august two thousand and seventeen at rupees one hundred and sixty per share in the
ratio of two for every five shares held he retains fifty percent of
the rights and renounces the balance right shares in favor of
another person mr y for rupees thirty per share in september
two thousand and seventeen all the shares are sold by mr x for rupees three hundred per share
in january two thousand and eighteen and mr y sells his shares in december
two thousand and seventeen at rupees two hundred and eighty per share we have to calculate the
capital gains taxable in the hands of mr x as well as in the
shares are issued prior first of april two thousand and one then the cost of
hello learners, we have seen many discussions on capital gains
budget two thousand and nineteen has announced something special and i thought
that let we take this to you one is that the assessee can
get an exemption by investing long term capital gains from the
sale of house property in up to two house properties
against the earlier provision of investment of
only one house property with same conditions
so, now remember, instead of one house property
you are getting two house property, though the
conditions are same however, the capital gains on the sale of
house property must not exceed rupees two crores
and i thought that let me end with some important facts
so, i thought that before we end the discussion on capital gains,
you must know the latest amendment which has been brought by
the budget two thousand and nineteen and applicable for the future assessment
now, before ending again i want to make a recap on
the identification of long term and short term capital asset
because the majority of the tax implications will depend on
whether the asset is a short term capital asset or a long
term capital asset as you can see under different categories
of assets, we have immovable property listed equity shares,
unlisted shares, equity mutual fund, dept mutual fund
as you know that capital gains attracts huge amount of tax
and other assets in case of immovable property,
the cutoff time is twenty-four months that means, if you can hold an immovable
property for a period of twenty-four months and more, it will qualify
for long term capital asset, but if the holding is up to twenty-four months,
then it is short term capital asset so, in long term
capital asset, you can get some kind of tax benefits in case of
listed equity shares it is twelve months not twenty-four months
so, twelve months a listed equity share if it is hold for a period of
more than twelve months, it will qualify as long term capital asset
unlisted shares, if it is not listedlisted twelve
because the gains itself sometimes is used so that's why
months in case of unlisted shares, it is twenty-four months
so, twenty-four months is the cutoff for unlisted shares like listed
equity shares, equity mutual funds are also twelve months
so,each mutual funds you hold it for twelve months or more,
it will qualify as long term capital asset
and the long term capital gain tax will be applicable as per the roll
depth mutual fund there is a difference
here it is thirty-six months not twelve months
depth mutual fund is thirty-six months thirty-six months required more than
thirty-six month required the period of holding for making it
we should take every care to see that the tax compliance is
long term capital asset and in case of all other assets,
it is the period of thirty-six months or three years
so, just remember the different categories of assets
so that you can see that whether
the asset qualifies for long term capital assets
so i thought that it has been important for me to discuss this
before i end the discussion on capital gains
thank you
properly done, you pay the required amount of tax as
calculated under different sections of the act
and at the same time, i would also say
that you take all the benefits which are given
under the act, the exemptions you should take
hello learners, we think that discussions on some problems
from here he has will get the deduction of bank charges
which is being charged six hundred and forty-two so, amount taxable under the head income
from other sources is thirty-three thousand, seven hundred and seventy-three income from house property there
is a rental income is one million, two hundred thousand so, his gross total
income coming as one million, two hundred and thirty-three thousand, seven hundred and seventy-three no information
reduction is given to us so, his total income or net income is one million, two hundred and thirty-three thousand, seven hundred and seventy-three
so, in case of government securities tax is
not deductible at source on one hundred and ninety-three so, we have adjusted the income
in case of non listed securities tax is deducted at
source at ten percent therefore, the amount realized in cash of
agricultural income from nepal rupees 25,000; then he has earned
debentures of xyz limited is two thousand, eight hundred and eighty it is calculated as three thousand, two hundred
minus ten percent of three thousand, two hundred interest on tax free relief bond is exempted
under section ten ( 15) and hence it is not taxable
now, let's see the last problem for this episode is problem number four
p holds the following securities on april one two thousand and seventeen
seven percent government loan, date of payment of interest is july
fifteen every year
limited, date of payment of interest is june thirty every year;
additional information p invest in two other government role and
receives rupees on december one two thousand and seventeen rupees thirty-six thousand and rupees
some interest from bank every year 10,800;
nineteen thousand respectively he also invest in the debentures of pqr
limited and december interest of rupees one lakh that is rate of
taxes ten percent being deducted, he pays six thousand as commission to his
bank for collecting interest on securitie , his business income
is two million, four hundred and thirty-two thousand so, find out the taxable income of p for the
assessment year two thousand and eighteen - nineteen solution is almost same as problem number three
so, debentures of abc limited is earning an interest
of 41,800; government loan 30,100; other government loan thirty-six thousand in
loan one; loan two it is 90,000; debentures of pq are limited
he has received one hundred and eight thousand but there is a deduction of tax
on post office savings bank account two thousand
of ten percent of the gross amount will be one hundred and twenty thousand
so, total is calculated as three hundred and seventeen thousand, nine hundred from here he will get the
deduction for the expenses of commission that is paid to bank six thousand
so, amount taxable under the head income from other sources
comes as three hundred and eleven thousand, nine hundred he has a business income of two million, four hundred and thirty-two thousand
so, his gross total income is two million, seven hundred and forty-three thousand, nine hundred
no information of deduction is given to us and as such is net
income will be two million, seven hundred and forty-three thousand, nine hundred through these problems four
problems and solutions, we have tried to give you some kind of
idea about how income tax is calculated under this particular
on public provident fund account five thousand, five hundred

now let's see the solutions to the problem
so again i am repeating the question, directors meeting fees
and solutions on income from other sources,
received from z limited
agriculture income from nepal
then he has earned some interest from bank fdr
savings bank
national savings certificate
company
and also he has got some rain for subletting so, these are major
components of income from other sources director meeting fee
three thousand, five hundred will come under the income from other sources
income, the agricultural land is situated in india is exempted under section ten
will clarify the concepts in an elaborate way
so, it will not come, but agriculture income from nepal will come
25,000; interest on fixed deposit is given as made
so, we have to get that gross which comes as twelve thousand rupees;
government securities interest is taxable one thousand
nsc interest is taxable two thousand, five hundred
of twenty-eight thousand but actual income is 40,000; rent received
this twelve thousand from but from twelve thousand he has paid expenses of
six thousand so six thousand is taxable so the if we get the total, total come
says rupees ninety thousand which is the computation of income under the
head income from other sources
so, we will be discussing four problems and solutions in this episode
let's see before going to the problem number two so just
the of problem number one agriculture to income from land
situated in india is exempted interest on post office savings
account bank account is exempt up to three thousand, five hundred interest earned from
ppf is fully exempted
under section ten of the act
let's see question number two problem number two
m has the following securities on april one two thousand and seventeen six percent debentures of
pq are limited data payment of interest is june eleven and
december eleven every year so, it is 35,000; five percent government
let's see problem number one, where is told that
loan date of payment of interest is january one it is eleven lakh
50,000; eight percent debentures of abc limited date of payment of

he has received a gift of rupees one lakh in foreign currency
from a friend in december two thousand and one - two thousand and seventeen on his marriage anniversary,
and post office savings bank interest that he is earned is four thousand
compute the income from other sources of mr z,
so, from these incomes which are being given we
have to calculate the taxable income in the hands of m for
the assessment year two thousand and eighteen - nineteen let's see the solutions to
problem number two debentures in pqr limited the
interest which is earned two thousand, one hundred two times has got the interest;
government loan the interest 57,500; in case of dventures in
abc limited is on one thousand rupees
10,000; gift is taxable 1000; post office savings bank account five hundred
will be taxable because three thousand, five hundred is exempted so, amount taxable
under the head income from other sources comes as one hundred and seventy-one thousand, one hundred
who submits the following particulars for the assessment year two thousand and nineteen - twenty
business income is taxable under the profits and gains of
business or profession and which is five lakhs so gross total
income is coming at rupees six hundred and seventy-one thousand, one hundred as he has
earned some income from bank interest, so he is eligible to
claim deduction under section eighty -tta, where interest on post office
bank account five hundred and pnb interest is 10,000; total comes
to ten thousand, five hundred but the maximum limit is given under section eighty -tta
is ten thousand so, he can claim up to rupees ten thousand so, his total
income after deduction of deductions under section eighty -tta
come as six hundred and sixty-one thousand, one hundred this is problem number two
these amounts are given in rupees
let's see problem number three
the following are the securities held by q on april one two thousand and seventeen
eight percent non listed debentures of xyz limited, date of payment also
twice in a year may fifteen and november fifteen is forty thousand
investment; six five percent central government loan which is 11,000;
eight percent tax relief bonds 50,000; additional information being

directors meeting fees received from z limited three thousand, five hundred
as interest on december thirty-one 2017; payment to bank as commission
for collecting interest as net is two percent
lakhs that is income from house property so, we have to
calculate the taxable income of q for the assessment year two thousand and eighteen - nineteen
let's see the solutions to the problem number three
so debentures amount received in cash and amount taxable
so debentures in xyz limited amount taxable is three thousand, two hundred
that is the loan is earning 715; other government loan three thousand, five hundred loan two
7000; debentures of abc limited is twenty thousand is the taxable amount
because they received the net amount of eighteen thousand so, total is thirty-four thousand, four hundred and fifteen
agricultural income from land situated in india rupees 15,000;
hello learners, after discussing various issues of deductions
the royalty, which is being done from postgraduate course by mrs
a it's seventy-four thousand, four hundred so, net income after deductions of all
these things come as six hundred and seventy-five thousand, one hundred for a, six hundred and eighty thousand and one million, one hundred and fifty-five thousand
so, income tax on net income forty-nine thousand, five hundred and twenty b forty-six thousand c
one hundred and forty-six thousand, five hundred there is no surcharges tax and surcharges
comes to forty-nine thousand, five hundred and twenty forty-six thousand one hundred and forty-six thousand, five hundred
we add education cess and then secondary cess and
ultimately we get the tax payable for a fifty-one thousand and ten forty-seven thousand, three hundred and eighty and
one hundred and fifty thousand, nine hundred so, in this way we can calculate the things
under check problem no two so here the difference is normal
major daughter (policy taken on one four 2014)
age, senior age and super senior age, how deductions are being
calculated
let's see problem no three
(assured value rs 1,81,000) they paid the premium of rs
twenty-one thousand medical insurance premium for self-
rs one million, one hundred and eighty thousand
and for spouse it is rs fourteen thousand, two hundred medical insurance premium
for self is rupees eleven thousand, eight hundred and for spouse is fourteen thousand, two hundred donations to a
public charitable institution registered under eighty g rs one hundred and fifty thousand
by way of cheque lic pension fund has contributed
rs fifty-eight thousand, nine hundred donation to national children fund rs
twenty-four thousand by way of cheque donation to jawaharlal nehru memorial fund
from gross total income, let us discuss some of the problems and
rs twenty-three thousand, five hundred by way of cheque donation to approve institution
for promotion of family planning rs thirty-nine thousand, five hundred by way of cheque
so, we have to calculate the total income of mr y for the
assessment year
two thousand and eighteen - nineteen
so, what will do we will see the gross total income and from
the gross total income we will try to deduct the deductions
which are eligible under different sections spreading
from eighty c to eighty u now solutions to this problem
no one gross total income was given as seven hundred and seventy-three thousand, nine hundred
solutions to make the concept more clear so, now, i will move
the first we get the deduction under section eighty c
eighty c deductions are life insurance premium paid for insurance
of major daughter that is maximum ten percent of the assured value
is eligible so, one hundred and eighty-one thousand is the policy value so eighteen thousand, one hundred
deduction under section eighty ccc in respect of lic pension fund
is fifty-eight thousand, nine hundred so, total is seventy-seven thousand so, here he could have taken up
to rs one hundred and fifty thousand deduction under section eighty d and
which is the medical insurance premium in respect of
self and spouse both eligible so, twenty-six thousand deduction under
section eighty g eighty g deduction there are a year's worth eighty-nine thousand and forty-five
to four problems along with solutions listen to these
but let me show you how it is being calculated so, this is the
working note for computation of deduction has given national
children fund twenty-four thousand it is one hundred percent eligible, so, deduction will be
given twenty-four thousand jawaharlal nehru memorial fund twenty-three thousand, five hundred percentage
of deduction here is fifty percent so, eligible deduction is eleven thousand, seven hundred and fifty
approved institution for promotion of family planning, it
is thirty-nine thousand, five hundred it is one hundred percent subject to a qualifying limit, but it
not cross the limit, so thirty-nine thousand, five hundred and public charitable trust it
is one hundred and fifty thousand here also fifty percent subject to qualifying limit fifty percent
happens to be seventy-five thousand but there is a qualifying limit and the
problems and learn the problems very minutely so that the
qualifying limit is shown here that adjusted total income is
err:509
section eighty c to eighty u except under section eighty g that is
rs six hundred and seventy thousand, nine hundred in this case rs sixty-seven thousand and ninety being that
ten percent of adjusted total income is the qualifying limit so, this
is the amount the firstly donation of rs thirty-nine thousand, five hundred to
approved institution
subject to qualifying limit has to be adjusted against
this amount thereafter donation to public charitable trust
qualifying for fifty percent deduction subject to qualifying limit is
concept is clear to you now, the question number one that we
adjusted as the contribution of rs one hundred and fifty thousand to public
charitable trust is restricted to rs twenty-seven thousand, five hundred and ninety (being sixty-seven thousand and ninety
-rs 39,500) fifty percent of which would be the deduction under section eighty g
therefore, the deduction under section eighty g in respect of
donation to public charitable trust will be rs thirteen thousand, seven hundred and ninety-five
being fifty percent of rs twenty-seven thousand, five hundred and ninety so, that's why public charitable
trust it is given as thirteen thousand, seven hundred and ninety-five so, total deduction under section
eighty g is eighty-nine thousand and forty-five so, here, deductions under section eighty g is
think that this problem gives us an overall idea about the
want to show to you, mr y aged sixty-one years has gross total income
deduction under section eighty c, eighty ccc, eighty d as well as eighty g
now, let's move to question no problem no two find
out the tax liability in the following cases for the
business of dealing in equity shares, income computed after
deducting securities transaction tax rs eighteen thousand, seven hundred and fifty is thirty-one thousand per
person one person two is a senior person and c is the
super senior person of eighty-eight years, is a normal forty-two years below age
sixty years of age she is the senior person of sixty-five years and
c is the super senior person of eighty-eight years income from
of rs seven hundred and seventy-three thousand, nine hundred comprising of income from salary
royalty of textbook for postgraduate course seventy-four thousand, four hundred
income from profession of acting in two cases they are earning
this, bank interest super senior person is earning five thousand, two hundred and fifty
lottery winning mrs a earning twenty thousand other income then
comes the gross total income of mrs a is nine hundred thousand b is seven hundred and twenty-five thousand
c is to one million, two hundred thousand because other income is
one million then contribution to public provident fund iis
one hundred and twenty thousand three thousand and fifteen thousand life insurance premium it is less
than the ten percent of sum assured so ten thousand, five hundred fifteen thousand forty-five thousand mediclaim
insurance premium on own life twenty thousand and thirty-two thousand expenditure on
and house property he has made following payments and
mediclaim treatment no medical insurance premium paid is
forty thousand so, this is the problem we are having this is the
question no two giving the situation of three persons
one is the normal age of below sixty years and another is senior
age sixty-five years and super senior age of eighty-eight years now let's see
how this has been done solution gross total income mrs a is
nine hundred thousand b is seven hundred and twenty-five thousand c is one million, two hundred thousand deductions under
various sections eighty c it is eighty c to eighty u deduction under
eighty c one hundred and thirty thousand, five hundred fifteen thousand and forty-five thousand under section
eighty d twenty thousand thirty thousand so, under section eighty qqb in respect of
investment: number one premium paid to ensure the life of her
let us continue with the further two problems while we will do
gift of kitchen appliances by employer (cost to employer
13,400), pension from a former employer, its it is
one hundred and seventy-six thousand, eight hundred house rent allowance is one hundred thousand rent paid
in delhi ninety thousand profits and gains of newly set up
undertaking in jammu & kashmir it's one hundred and thirty-four thousand
profit from publication of books one hundred and forty thousand income from
royalty on final accounts a book written by x in hindi and
recommendations by the rajasthan university (gross amount is
seventeen thousand expenses is 5000) so, he has received twelve thousand interest
on post office bank account fifteen thousand, five hundred profits from business of
problem no three and question no four question no three mr
dealing in equity shares on which securities transaction tax
eighteen thousand, seven hundred and sixty is paid and the profit is calculated after deducting
securities transaction tax of eighteen thousand, seven hundred and sixty is thirty-five thousand profits from
business of growing mushrooms, two hundred and twenty-eight thousand profits from
export of goods outside india three hundred and twenty-one thousand income from
royalty on payments is thirteen thousand so he has got variety of income
and as well as one payment let's see how it is being done so
here to determine the net income and tax there on of mr x for
the assessment year two thousand and eighteen - nineteen giving all permissible deductions now
solutions to problem no three income from salary is a
a submits the following information for the year two thousand and eighteen - nineteen
basic salary, project allowance, house high cost of living
allowance, commission, gift of kitchen appliances, in case of
house rent allowance he he will be get in some exemption under section
ten ( thirteen a) which is given a note no one and which we'll see
that exemption in case of house rent allowance is the least of
the following that is actual house rent allowance received
than excess of rent paid over ten percent salary salary is
already calculated of three hundred and forty-eight thousand, six hundred so, fifty-five thousand, one hundred and forty and fifteen percent of
salary is one hundred and seventy-four thousand, three hundred out of this three rs fifty-five thousand, one hundred and forty being the
least and is therefore, exempt from tax so, this is the
payments, insurance premium on life insurance policy on the
deductions under from the gross house rent allowance, then pension
and gross salary is seven hundred and ninety-seven thousand and sixty and then we will see the
profits and gains of business and profession newly set up
industrial undertaking, publication of book, profit from
dealing in equity shares, export of goods, royalty on payments,
growing of mushrooms so, income from other sources is eight hundred and seventy-seven thousand
interest on post office bank deposit is twelve thousand and
royalty on book an expenses five thousand so, it is ultimately twelve thousand
plus twelve thousand twenty-four thousand so gross total income comes to six hundred and ninety-eight thousand and sixty
now see the deductions under section eighty c to eighty u under
life of mrs x policy was taken in two thousand and four by the hindu undivided
section eighty c, the life insurance premium is one lakh thirty thousand under
section eighty ib in respect of newly set up industrial
undertaking, provided we're assuming that they are satisfied
all the conditions so thirty-three thousand, five hundred under section eighty qqb in
respect of royalty twelve thousand under section eighty rrb in respect of
regulatory on payments, thirteen thousand under section eighty tt in respect
of interest received from post office savings bank account is
eligible to get ten thousand so total deduction under section eighty c to eighty u
is one hundred and ninety-eight thousand, five hundred net income is one million, four hundred and ninety-nine thousand, five hundred and sixty we
can calculate the tax as per applicable rate it comes to two hundred and sixty-two thousand, three hundred and sixty-eight
family of x and some assured is rs eight hundred and twenty thousand so, x
and then there is education cess of five thousand, two hundred and forty-seven plus two thousand, six hundred and twenty-four and the
tax liability will be rounded off at two hundred and seventy thousand, two hundred and forty so this
is a comprehensive problem giving salaries as well as
income from other sources now the last one question no four
two partners p and q are in the ratio of 3:2 of
a firm at delhi they provided the following information for
the year ending two thousand and eighteen long term capital gains in respect of

tax is six thousand, five hundred so, you had to determine the net income of the
firm for the assessment year two thousand and eighteen - nineteen so, just have a look on
the problem it is a comprehensive one getting
two hundred and eighty-eight thousand, six hundred project allowance one hundred and six thousand high cost of living
different kinds of income now solutions
up industrial undertaking 2,25,000; profit from export of
telecast rights 1,40,000; profit from export of machines
2,40,000; capital gains 10,000; income from other sources
are winning from lottery as well as gift so gross total income is
eight hundred and eighty-five thousand so, from eight hundred and eighty-five thousand deductions under section
eighty c to eighty u are available so under section eighteen g in respect of
donation to prime minister's national relief fund cash donation exceeding
rupees two thousand is not deductible so, he is not eligible under
section eighty ib for newly set up industrial undertaking ten year
allowance one hundred and twelve thousand, four hundred commission which has received ( one percent on
limit has already expired so, nothing is allowable so, net
income is eight hundred and eighty-five thousand so, this is a tricky one in solution
no four we will be trying to provide you this in printed
form so that you can have a look on this kind of things in our
particular site and we hope that we will do other problems
and solutions also to make yourself clear about the chapter
deductions from gross total income thank you
turnover, turnover achieved by x is rs 60,00,000) so sixty thousand
welcome learners,
a's minor son of shares in a foreign company worth rupees
fifty thousand owned by him this is an example so, the income of the
assets transferred would be assessed in the hands of the
deemed transferor if the transferor are so intimately
connected as to form part of a single transaction, and each
transferor constitutes consideration for the other by
being mutual or otherwise so be cautious about cross tranferor
also section sixty-four ( 2) deals with conversion of self
acquired property into the property of hindu undivided
family in this case also the attraction of clubbing
that is income of one person is taxable by another person now,
provisions will be there the income includes loss, it is
significant to note that as per explanation two to the section sixty-four
income would also include loss accordingly, where the specified
income to be included in the total income of the individual
is a loss, such loss will be taken into account while
computing the total income of the individual it is
significant to note that this explanation applies to clubbing
provisions under both section sixty-four ( 1) as well as
sixty-four sub section two so learners in this week, we have learned a
very important aspect and an interesting aspect of clubbing
what are the situations in which such things can happen and
of income, that is income of other persons computed in
calculating total income of the assessee's normally, it doesn't
happen in normal circumstances because the income tax that says
that the assessee's is liable to pay tax on his or her own income
but there are certain situations which are explained under
section sixty to section sixty-four where the situations arise that the income
of other persons will be clubbed into the assessee's total income
so, we have seen all such situations and have learned that
these are the occasions where the income of some other persons
will be taken into the computation of total income of
that is learners you should also note it very minutly,
the assessee's thank you very much
because the clubbing provisions can be attracted if a person is
unaware of the fact no one section sixty transfer of income
without transfer of asset that is if any person transfers the
income from any asset without transferring the asset, the
property or the title of the asset itself, such income is to
be included in the total income of the transferor in that
case, such kind of transfer will not be valid secondly,
this week, we will learn another important topic which is given
section sixty-one that is income arising from revocable transfer
of assets, that is any income arising to any person by virtue
of a revocable transfer of asset is to be included in the
total income of the transferor now, what is revocable transfer
that is the transfer can be revoced at the option of the
tranferor
so, such
kind of transfers will not be taken as valid transfer in the
eye of income tax and income arising from revocable transfer
will be included in the total income of the transferor by
under income tax act one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one that is clubbing of income that is
section sixty-one of the income tax act section sixty-four ( 1) (ii)
that is income by way of remuneration from a
concern in which the individual has substantial interest that is
in computing the total income of any individual all such income
which arises directly or indirectly to the spouse of such
individual, by way of salary, commission fees or any other
form of remuneration, whether in cash or in kind from a concern
in which such individual has a substantial interest shall be
included substantial internal efforts to holding off at least
twenty percent of the voting rights section sixty-four ( 1) (iv)
income of other persons, which are included in assessee's total
that is income arising to the spouse from an
asset transferred without adequate consideration where
there is a transfer of an asset other than house property,
directly or indirectly from one spouse to another, otherwise
then for adequate consideration or in connection with an
agreement to leave apart any income arising from or any
income arising to the transferee from the transferred asset,
either directly or indirectly shall be included in the total
income of the transferor similarly, section sixty-four ( 1) (vii)
says transfer of assets for the benefit of
income the income tax act says that a person is liable to pay
spouse all income arising directly or indirectly to any
person or association of persons from assets transferred directly
or indirectly without adequate consideration is includable in
the income of the transferor to the extent such income is used
by the transferee for the immediate or deferred benefit
of transferor spouse
income arising to son's wife from the assets transferred
without consideration by the father-in-law or mother- in-law,
it is under section sixty-four ( 1) (vi) where an
asset is transferred directly or indirectly by an individual to
income tax on the income of his or her own income but can it
his or her son's wife without adequate consideration, the
income from such asset is to be included in the total income of
the transferor transfer of assets for the benefit of son's wife
all income arising directly or indirectly to any person or
association of persons from the assets transferred directly or
indirectly, without adequate consideration will be included
in the total income of the transferor to the extent such
income is used by the transferee for the immediate or
deferred benefit of transferor son's wife so, these are the
cases where a person should be very cautious of dealing with
happen that somebody else is earning the income and the
such situations because the clubbing section of sixty-four
subsection one will be very active and the income even
though it is transferred to some other persons will be clubbed
with the transferors income now, important aspect is minor
income earned by minor that is clubbing of minors income, which
is also given under section sixty-four ( one a) all
income of a minor is to be included in the income of his or
her parent however, the income derived by the minor for for
manual work or from any activity involving he is our skill,
talent or specialized knowledge or experience will not be
income tax is making another person liable for such income?
included in the income of his her parent the income of the
minor will be included in the income of that parent whose
income is greater
once clubbing minor's income
is done with that of one parent it will continue to be clubbed
with that parent only in subsequent years the assessing
officer may however, club the minor's income with that of the
other parent if, after giving the other parents an opportunity
to be heard, he is satisfied that it is necessary to do so
finnaly discuss section ten sub section thirty-two we have seen an
yes, it is possible and this are dealt in section sixty to
exemption in respect of clubbed income of minor in case the
income of an individual that is parent includes the income of
his/her minor child such parent shall be entitled to an
exemption of rupees one thousand, five hundred in respect of each minor child
however, if the income of any minor, so includable is less
than rupees one thousand, five hundred then the entire income is exempted there is
some instances of cross transfers that is in case of
cross transfers also for example, mr a is making gift of
rupees fifty thousand to the wife of his brother mr b for the purchase
of a house by her and simultaneous gift by mr b to
section sixty-five of the income tax act, that is clubbing of income
now let's see a discussion on set off and carry forward of
of losses now in case of set off and carry forward, the rule is
that first the assessee is given an option for inter source
adjustment if inter source adjustment is not possible, then
the assessee can go for inter head adjustment if inter head
adjustment is also not sufficient for the loss because
the loss is so high in that case the assessee can carry forward the
loss only if the loss cannot be set off by intersource
adjustment or inter head adjustment now, what is inter
source adjustment, which is given under section seventy of the
income tax act under this section, the losses incurred by
losses it is not necessary that the assessee's will earn income
the assessee in respect of one source shall be set off against income
from any other source under the same head of income, since the
income under each head is to be computed by grouping together
the net result of the activities of all the sources covered by
that particular head in simpler terms, loss from one source of
income can be adjusted against income from another source, both
source being under the same head let us take one example
example one loss from one house property can be set off against
the income of another house property example two loss from
one business, say garment selling can be set off against
every time or will earn income from all the five heads of
income from another business say grocery in the same year as both
these sources of income fall under one head of income
therefore, the loss in one business may be set off against
the profits of another business in the same year inter
source set off however, is not permissible in certain case,
like long term capital loss short term capital loss is
allowed to be set off against both short term capital gain and
long term capital gain however, long term capital loss can be
set off only against long term capital gain and not from short
term capital gain also, there is a point on speculation loss
income it may happen that the assesseee may earn income from one
a loss in speculation business can be set off only against the
profits of any other speculation business and not against any
other business or professional income however, losses
from other business can be adjusted against the profits of
speculation business
then loss from activity of owning and maintaining
resources such loss can be set off only against the income from
the activity of owning and maintaining of resources and
there are certain loss from specified business referred to
section thirty-five ad that can be set off only against other specified
head of income may incur loss in other head of income or in one
business however, losses from other business can be set off
against profits from specified business so, besides these
exceptions, otherwise first we should go for inter source
adjustment to see whether the loss can be set off from one
source with another if inter source adjustment is not
sufficient, then we may go for inter head adjustment which is
given under section seventy-one that is loss under one head of income
can be adjusted or set off against income from another
head however, there are certain points which must be considered
that is where the net result of the computation of any head of
particular head of income also, the assessee may earn income from one
income other than capital gains, is a loss, the assessee can set off
such loss against his or her income assessable for that
assessment year under any other head, including capital gains
where the net result of the computation under the head
profits and gains of business or profession is a loss, such loss
cannot be set off against income under the head salaries where the
net result of computation under the head capital gains is a
loss, such capital loss cannot be set off against the income of
any other head where net result of computation under the head
income from house property is a loss and the assessee has income
particular unit may incur loss in other particular unit or the
assessable under any other head of income, the amount of such
loss exceeding rupees two lakhs would not be allowed to be set
off against the income under any other head in other words, the
maximum loss from house property which can be set off against
income from any other head is rupees two lakhs
speculation loss, loss from activity of owning and
maintaining race horses, losses from specified business referred
to section thirty-five ad cannot be set off against income under any
other head otherwise we accept these exceptions there can be
losses which should be set off from one head with another head
losses may be so great that ultimately in the return of
income also the total is loss so is to handle such
situations, there is a chapter call set off and carry forward
section seventy-one b gives set off and carry forward of loss from house
there is order of set off of losses as per the provisions of
section seventy-two ( 2) brought forward business loss is to be
set up before setting the unabsorbed depreciation so,
there is an order firstly, the current year depreciation or
current year capital expenditure on scientific research current
year expenditure on family planning is to the extent
allowed deducted then comes brought forward loss from
business and proffesion
followed by on unabsorbed capital expenditure on scientific
research
loss was computed for example, the loss of one house property
so, through this order, the losses ultimate losses can also
be carried forward for the next assessment years
can be adjusted against the profits of another house
property in the same assessment year any loss under the head
income from house property can be set off against any income
under any other head to the extent of rs two hundred thousand in
any assessment year however, if after such set of still there is
loss under the head capital income from house property, then
the same shall be carried forward to the next years it is
to be remembered that once a particular loss is carried
forward, it can be set off only against the income from the same
property if in any assessment year there is a loss under the
head in the forthcoming assessment years section seventy-two and eighty
deals with carry forward and set off of business losses under
this act the assessee has the right to carry forward the loss from
the business and profession in case where such loss cannot be
set off due to the absence or inadequacy of income under any
other head in the same year the loss so carried forward can be
set off against the profits of subsequent previous years
section seventy-two covers the carry forward and set off of losses
arising from business or profession there are certain
conditions the assessee's right to carry forward business losses
head income from house property, such loss will be first set off
under this section of that is section seventy-two has certain
conditions the loss should have been incurred in the business,
profession or vocation the loss should not be in the nature of
loss in the business of speculation the loss may be
carried forward and set off against the income from business
or profession, though not necessarily against the profits
and gains of same business or profession in which the loss was
incurred however, a loss carried forward cannot under any
circumstances, be set off against the income from any
other head other than profits and gains of business or
against the income of any other head to the extent of rs
profession the loss can be carried forward and set off only
against the profits of the assessee who incurred the loss
that is, only the person who has incurred the loss is entitled to
carry forward or set off the same consequently, the
successor of a business cannot carry forward or set off the
loss of his predecessor, except in the case of succession by the
inheritance a business loss can be carried forward for a maximum
period of eight assessment years, immediately succeeding
the assessment year in which the loss was incurred section seventy-three
deals with the losses in speculation business since
two hundred thousand during the same year the unabsorbed loss will be carried
speculation is deemed to be a business distinct and separate
from any other business carried on by the assessee the losses
incurred in speculation can be neither set off in the same
year against any other non speculation income, nor be
carried forward and set off against other income in the
subsequent year so, speculation business is an exclusive area
and it cannot be mixed up with other kinds of business section
seventy-three a deals with carry forward and set off of losses by
specified businesses any loss computed in respect of the
specified business referred in section thirty-five ad shall be
forward to the following assessment year to be set off
set off only against profits and gains, if any of any other
specified business the unobserved loss if any, will be
carried forward, for set off against the profits and gains of
any specified business in the following assessment year
and so on there is no time limit specified for carry
forward and set off and therefore, such loss can be carried forward
indefinitely for set off against income from specified business
however, the return of loss to be filed on or before the due
date of filing of return under section one hundred and thirty-nine ( 1) for carry
forward of loss from specified business so, this is regarding
against income under the head income from house property and
the rules for specified business section seventy-four deals exclusively
with the capital gains, this is losses under the head capital
gains section seventy-four provides that where for any assessment year
the net result under the head capital gains is short term
capital loss or long term capital loss, the loss shall be
carried forward to the following assessment year end to be set
off under certain conditions that is where the loss so
carried forward is a short term capital loss it shall be set
off against any capital gain short term or long term arising in
that year where the loss, so carried forward is a long term
not from any other head the loss under this head is
capital loss, it shall be set off against long term capital
gain arising in that year net loss under the head capital
gains cannot be set off against income under any other head any
unabsorbed loss to be carried forward to the following
assessment year and up to a maximum of eight assessment
years, immediately succeeding the assessment year for which
the loss was first
computed
there is a business of owning and maintaining race horses so,
according to the provisions of section seventy-four a( 3)
allowed to be carried forward up to eight assessment years,
the losses incurred by an assessee from the activity of
owning and maintaining race horses cannot be set off against
income of any source other than the activity of owning and
maintaining race horses such loss can be carried forward for a
maximum period of four assessment years for being set
off against the income from the activity of owning and
maintaining race horses in the subsequent years so, just note
in other cases, it is normally eight years, but in case of
activity of owning and maintaining resources, the
losses can be carried forward for a period of four years now,
immediately succeeding the assessment year in which the
welcome friends
britishers developed the electronic relay storage automatic calculator or the ersac
a group of scientists headed by professor maurice wilkes at the cambridge university
mathematical laboratory, developed this machine
in this machine, addition operation took one thousand five hundred microseconds and multiplication
operation took four thousand microseconds
the univac one, nineteen fifty one – universal automatic computer one was the first commercial
computer produced in the united states
it was designed principally by j presper eckert and john mauchley, the inventors of
eniac
design work was begun by the company eckert mauchley computer corporation
a computer can store, process and retrieve data as and when required
univac one used five thousand two hundred vacuum tubes, weighed twenty nine thousand
pounds, consumed one twenty five kilo watt and could perform about one thousand nine
hundred and five operations per second running on a two point two five megahertz clock
in the nineteen seventies, programmable mini computers supplied with software packages
the size reduction trend continued with the introduction of personal computers which are
programmable machines, small enough and inexpensive enough to be purchased and used by individuals
the first computer of this type was called the altair double eight double zero
its programming involved pushing buttons and flipping switches on the front of the box
it didn't include a monitor or keyboard and its applications were very limited
computer generations – generation in computer terminology is a step in technology
computer science is the study of computers and their architecture, languages and applications
it provides a framework for the growth of computer industry
the custom of referring to computer era in terms of generations came into wide use only
after nineteen sixty four
although there is a certain amount of overlap between different generations, the approximate
period shown against each are normally accepted
first generation from nineteen forty two to nineteen fifty five – eniac, edvac, ersac,
univac one, ibm seven naught one
second generation from nineteen fifty five to nineteen sixty four – honeywell four
hundred, ibm seven zero three zero, cdc one six zero four, univac lakh
third generation from the period nineteen sixty four to nineteen seventy five – ibm three sixty
in all aspects as well as the mathematical structures that relate to computers and computation
or three seventy, pdp eight, pdp eleven, cdc double six double zero
fourth generation, nineteen seventy five to nineteen eighty nine – ibm pc and its clones,
apple two, trs eighty, vax nine thousand, cray one, cray two, cray x-mp
fifth generation from nineteen eighty nine to present – ibm notebooks, pentium pcs,
sun workstations, ibm sp two, sgi origin two thousand, param ten thousand
when we consider the advancements in hardware, the key characteristics of each generation
can be summarized as follows- generation and period and key hardware technologies
first, nineteen forty two to fifty five – vacuum tubes, electromagnetic relay memory, punched
cards, secondary storage
second, nineteen fifty five to sixty four – transistors, magnetic core memory, magnetic
thus, it led a foundation for computer design, computer programming, information processing
tapes and disks secondary storage
third, from nineteen sixty four to seventy five – ics with ssi and msi technologies,
larger magnetic core memory, larger capacity magnetic disks and tapes secondary storage,
mini computers
fourth, nineteen seventy five to eighty nine – ics with vlsi technology, microprocessors,
semiconductor memory, larger capacity hard disks as in-built secondary storage, magnetic
tapes and floppy disks as portable storage media, personal computers, spread of high-speed
computer network
fifth, from nineteen eighty nine to present period – ics with ulsi technology, larger
capacity main memory, larger capacity hard disks, optical disks as portable read only
algorithmic solution of problems, etcetera
storage media, notebook computers, powerful desktop pcs and workstations, very powerful
mainframes and the internet
successive generations have their size decreased but the capabilities, uses and reliability
increased
they became more and more user friendly, efficient and are easier to produce commercially
when we take in to account the software technologies and the applications of each generation computers,
it can be categorized as generation and software technologies and applications
first, nineteen forty two to fifty five – machine and assembly language, stored program concept
used for calculations
second, from fifty five to sixty four – batch operating systems, high level programming
the characteristics of computers – the power and usefulness of computers are mainly due
languages, scientific and commercial applications
third, nineteen sixty four to nineteen seventy five – time sharing operating system, standardization
of high-level programming languages, unbundling of software from hardware
fourth, from nineteen seventy five to nineteen eighty nine – operating systems for pcs,
gui, multiple windows on a single terminal screen, unix operating system, c programming
language, pc based applications, network based applications
fifth, from the period nineteen eighty nine to present – world wide web, multimedia
applications, internet based applications
number systems – a computer stores data internally in a format that is not easily
readable by human beings
to the following characteristics
a computer stores characters, numbers and all special characters in coded form
these codes are based on the number system
generally, number systems are of two types – non positional and positional
in early days, human beings used fingers, stones, pebbles, etcetera to count
this method uses non positional number system since each symbol represents the same value
regardless of its position in a number
in positional number system, there are only a limited number of symbols called digits
but these digits represent different values depending on the position they occupy in a
number
we use decimal number systems in our day to day life
automatic- once started on a job, computers carry out the job until it is finished
it uses ten symbols or digits
they are zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight and nine
thus, its base is equal to ten
in a decimal number system, successive positions from right to left to the decimal points represent
units, tens, hundreds, etcetera, which is a specific power of base ten
the number eight seven four five to the base ten can be written as eight into ten cube
plus seven into ten square plus four into ten raise to one plus five into ten raise
to zero which is equal to eight thousand plus seven hundred plus forty plus five which is
equal to eight thousand seven hundred and forty five
from the following example, we can see that the same digit signifies different values
but we need to instruct a computer using coded instructions that specify exactly how it will
depending upon the position of that digit in the number
in six five seven three to the base ten, the digit three signifies three into ten raise
to zero which is equal to three
in six three five seven to the base ten, the digit three signifies three into ten square
which is equal to three hundred
the number systems relevant to computers are binary number system
it’s like decimal number system but the base is two because it uses only two digits,
zero and one
each position in a binary number represents a power of the base two
thus, the rightmost position is units, that is two raise to zero
do a particular job
in this session i am giving you a brief introduction to the fundamentals of computers
the second from right is twos, two raise to one, etcetera
the decimal equivalent of a binary number one one one zero one to the base two is one
into two raise to four plus one into two raise to three plus one into two raise to two plus
zero into two raise to one plus one into two raise to zero which is equal to sixteen plus
eight plus four plus zero plus one which is equal to twenty nine
octal number system – in octal number system, the base is eight, so there are eight symbols
or digits, zero, one, two, three, four, five, six and seven
each position represents a power of the base eight
thus, the decimal equivalent of octal number one zero two four to the base eight is one
into eight raise to three plus zero into eight raise to two plus two into eight raise to
accuracy- accuracy of a computer is consistently high and the degree of its accuracy depends
one plus four into eight raise to zero equal to five twelve plus zero plus sixteen plus
four which is equal to five thirty two
hexadecimal system – here the base is sixteen
hence there are sixteen symbols or digits
the first ten digits are same as that of the decimal number system
they are zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight and nine
the other six digits are the a, b, c, d, e and f each position represents a power of
the base sixteen
the decimal equivalent of the hexadecimal number forty five f to the base sixteen can
be written as four into sixteen square plus five into sixteen to the power one plus f
upon its design
into sixteen to the power zero which is equal to four into two fifty six plus five into
sixteen plus fifteen into one which is equal to thousand twenty four plus eighty plus fifteen
which is equal to one thousand one hundred and nineteen
algorithms – in order to solve a problem, we need to know the steps to solve the problem
and the sequence in which these steps to be applied
as we said earlier, for the computer to solve a particular problem, it should be instructed
the steps to be followed to reach a solution
to ensure that the instructions of a program are suitable for the problem and are in the
correct sequence, it should be planned before writing it
planning involves defining the logic
a computer performs every calculation with the same accuracy
algorithm means logic
it can be defined as a sequence of precise and unambiguous instructions which when executed
in the specified sequence produces the desired result
here, each instruction should be executed in a finite time
there are different methods to represent an algorithm
the important ones are-
as programs – represented using programming language
every program is an algorithm but every algorithm is not a program
as flowcharts – pictorial representation of an algorithm
it is used for visually organizing a sequence of steps to solve a particular problem
diligence- unlike human beings, a computer is free from monotony, tiredness and lack
as pseudocodes – instructions written in ordinary natural languages like english,
computer languages – just as we have various languages to communicate with one another
and each language has its own vocabulary and grammatical roles, we have different languages
to convey instructions to the computer
every computer language has its own rules called syntax and vocabulary called keywords
there are three types of programming languages- machine level language, assembly level language
and high level language
the language which a computer can understand is called a machine level language
that is in the binary form
the program written in machine level language is totally depended on the individual machine
of concentration
as machine language is the language of the cpu, programs written in this language are
executed very fast
writing programs in this language is very time consuming and error prone
because of these limitations, programs are rarely written in machine level languages nowadays
assembly language is one level above the machine level language
it uses certain predefined symbolic codes called mnemonics instead of binary codes
assembly language closely resembles machine language and both are considered low level languages
since, a computer cannot understand assembly language, a translator called assembler, converts
the assembly codes to machine understandable format
some of the limitations of machine level language have been overcome in assembly level language
it can continuously work for hours without creating any error and without grumbling
but the coding and debugging continue to remain difficult as it is written using some special
character
to solve this problem, high level languages came into existence
most of the programs in high level languages are written in general english
hence, it is easy to learn, code and debug
high level languages are designed for providing better programming efficiency but special
translators are needed to convert the code into the machine understandable format
there are two types of translators, namely, interpreters and compilers
the interpreter is a special type of program that translates the program written in a high
level language into machine language at the time of executing that program line by line
if ten million calculations have to be performed, a computer will perform the last one with
and finds if any syntax error in the code
therefore, no object code is saved for future use because the translation and execution
processes alternate
most of the interpreted languages are slow in execution
example- basic, perl, etcetera
the compilers are special type of programs that checks for syntax errors
if an error is found, the compiler points out the error and gives a message to the programmer
before a program is executed, the code is compiled and the entire high level language
program is converted into machine understandable format called object program
the compiled form is directly given for execution, no interpretation, as it is already in the
exactly the same accuracy and speed as the first one
machine language format
thus, the compiler based languages are faster
example- c, c plus plus, etcetera
the basic principles of computer science – even though, the size, shape, performance, reliability
and cost of computers have been changing over the years, the basic concept to store program
has not changed
for converting the raw data into information and presenting it to a user, a computer performs
five basic operations
one, input – receiving data into a computer system
second, store – saving data and instructions for processing
power of remembering- a computer can store and recall any amount of information because
third, process – performing arithmetic and logical operations
four, output – producing results for a user, either soft copy or hard copy
five, control – control the way and sequence in which these operations are performed
please try to answer the following questions-
define computer
what will be the decimal equivalent of twenty four point one eight seven five to the base
sixteen?
convert the binary number one zero zero zero one one to the base two to decimal
write a short note on compilers and interpreters
what is the role of assembler?
of its secondary storage capability
the word computer comes from the word compute which means to calculate
explain the evolution of computers
what are the different programming languages?
what are the different characteristics of a computer?

take care
it can retain a piece of information as long as a user desires and the user can recall
the information whenever required
a computer forgets or loses certain information only when a user asks it to do so
so, it is entirely up to the user to make a computer retain or forget some information
speed- a computer is a fast device
computers are capable of performing several billion arithmetic operations per second
versatility- it is one of the most wonderful things about a computer
a computer is capable of performing almost any task, if the task can be reduced to a
finite series of steps
evolution of computers – the computer truly is one of the most incredible inventions in
generally, a computer is considered to be a calculating device that can perform arithmetic
history
the electronic computer has been around for over a half century but its ancestors have
been around for two thousand years
from the first wooden abacus to the latest high speed microprocessor, the computer has
changed a lot, both internally and externally
the main goal of computer manufacturers was to make the computer as affordable as possible
while increasing speed, reliability and capacity
nearly every computer manufacturer accomplished this and computers popped up everywhere
computers were in businesses, keeping track of inventories
computers were in colleges aiding students in research
operations at high speed
computers were in laboratories making complex calculations at high speeds for scientists
and physicists
the computers had made its mark everywhere in society and built up a huge industry
blaise pascal invented the first mechanical adding machine in sixteen forty two
in the year sixteen seventy one, b g wilhelm von leibniz of germany invented the first
calculator for multiplication
keyboard machines originated in the us around eighteen eighty
around the same period, herman hollerith came up with the concept of punched cards that
were extensively used as input medium in computers even in late nineteen seventies
charles babbage, a nineteenth century professor at cambridge university is considered to be
in fact, the original objective for inventing a computer was to create a fast calculating machine
the father of modern computers
babbage designed a different engine in the year eighteen twenty two that could produce
reliable mathematical and statistical tables
built into his machine were operations that included everything a modern general purpose
computer would need
it was programmed by and stored data on cards with holes punched in them, appropriately
called punch cards
in eighteen forty two, he came out with his new idea of a completely automatic analytical
engine for performing basic arithmetic functions for any mathematical problems
unfortunately, he was unable to produce a working model for this machine
however, more than eighty percentage of work done by today's computers is of non-mathematical
some of the well-known early computers are the abacus
it is simply a wooden rack of holding parallel wires on which beads are strung
when these beads are moved along the wire according to programming rules that the user
must memorize, all ordinary arithmetic operations can be performed
the mark one computer, nineteen thirty seven to forty four – it is also known as automatic
sequence controlled calculator and it was the first fully automatic calculating machine
designed by howard a aiken
it was an electro-mechanical device based on the techniques already developed for punched
card machines which can handle twenty three digit numbers
though it was very complex in design and huge in size, it was extremely reliable
or non-numerical in nature
it was capable of performing four basic arithmetic operations- addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division and had special built-in programs to handle logarithms and trigonometric functions
the atanasoff-berry computer, from nineteen thirty nine to forty two – doctor john atanasoff
developed an electronic machine to solve certain mathematical equations
the machine was called atanasoff-berry computer or abc
it used forty five vacuum tubes for internal logic and capacitors for storage
the eniac, from the period nineteen forty three to forty six – the electronic numerical
integrator and calculator eniac was first of all electronic computers
in nineteen forty two, john p eckert, john w mauchley and their associates, at the university
of pennsylvania developed eniac for military needs
so, more accurately, we can define a computer as a device that operates upon data
it could add two numbers in two hundred microseconds and multiply them in two thousand microseconds
the edvac, nineteen forty seven to forty nine – the major drawback of eniac was that its
programs were wired on boards that made it difficult to change the programs
the electronic discrete variable automatic computer or the edvac used the stored program
concept in its design
doctor john von neumann introduced the idea of storing both instructions and data in binary
form, that is, stored program instead of decimal numbers or human readable words
this feature considerably influenced the development of modern digital computer because of the
ease with which different programs can be loaded and executed on the same computer
the ersac, nineteen forty seven to forty nine – almost simultaneously with edvac, the
data comes in various types and sizes depending upon the type of computer application
welcome back
offline means that, human intervention is required before the device must be turned
on or the medium holding the information must be inserted into by some mechanism
primary storage of a computer has only a limited capacity and it is volatile
thus, to store huge amount of data, which need to be permanent in the system, secondary
storages have been developed
they are non-volatile and have lower cost per bit stored, but generally have lower operational speed
the data stored in secondary storage can partially be transferred to primary storage whenever required
for the earlier systems, punched paper tapes and punched cards were used
but the popular ones today are magnetic tapes, magnetic disk, optical disk and memory storage devices
data are stored in secondary storage in the same binary codes as in primary storage and
the characters and numbers fed to a computer and the output from the computer must be in
are made available to primary storage as needed
a major disadvantage of the mass storage system is that, they typically require mechanical
motion and therefore require significantly more time to store and retrieve data than
a machine’s main memory
the secondary storage devices selected for a particular application depends mainly upon
how the stored information need to be accessed
the mainly used accessing methods are sequential or serial access and direct or random access
thus the commonly used secondary storage devices can be classified as- sequential access devices
and direct access devices
sequential access devices – memory is organized into units of data called block
a human readable form
data blocks are stored one after the other
a sequential access storage device is one in which the arrival at desired location may
be proceeded by sequencing through other locations, so that access time varies according to location
information on a sequential access devices can be retrieved in the same sequence only
in which it is stored
its shared read write mechanism is used and this must be more from its current location
to the desired location, passing and rejecting each intermediate block
while working with sequential access device, if an address is required out of order, it
can be reached only by searching through all the addresses stored before it
for example, data stored at the last few locations cannot be accessed until all preceding locations
these constitute the external data representation
in the sequence have been traversed which is analogous to a music tape cassette
sequential accessing is quite suitable for such applications like preparation of monthly
pay slips or monthly electricity bills, etcetera, where each address need to be accessed in line
the commonly used sequential access device is magnetic tape unit
direct access devices – in many applications, we need to access information in a more direct
manner than sequential access devices allow
as with sequential access, direct access involves a shared read write mechanism
however, individual blocks have a unique address based on the physical location
direct access storage devices are also called semi random storage devices because any data
can be accessed directly and approximately equal access time is required for each location
but the representation of data inside a computer must match the technology used by the computer
this is analogous to a music cd
direct access storage devices are suitable for such applications like banking system,
airline reservation system, etcetera, where immediate access may be required
magnetic disk, optical disk and mass memory storage devices are examples of direct access
storage devices
types of secondary storage devices – a wide variety of secondary storage devices is available
in today’s computers
the most commonly used are magnetic tape, magnetic disk or diskette, cd roms and dvd
magnetic tape – magnetic tape medium is a plastic ribbon, usually half inch or one
by fourth inch wide and fifty to two thousand four hundred feet long
to store and process data
magnetic tapes are particularly suited for offline storage of large amounts of data
data are recorded on the tape in the form of tiny, invisible, magnetized spots on the
iron oxide side of the tape
the tape is divided into vertical columns called frames and horizontal rows called tracks
a character is recorded per frame using any of the alphanumeric codes
a magnetic tape must be mounted on a tape drive before it can be used for a reading
writing of information
a tape drive is connected to and controlled by a tape controller that interprets the commands
for operating the tape drive
advantages – unlimited storage- the storage capacity is virtually unlimited because as
storage of bits – today’s computers store all the information, both numeric and alphanumeric,
many tapes as required can be used for storing large data
higher density- large amount of data can be stored without compression
thus cost per bit of storage is very low for magnetic tape
portability- due to the compact size and light weight, magnetic tape reels and cartridges
are also easily portable form one place to another
they are often used for transferring data and program from one computer to another that
are not linked together
reusable- they are reused a number of times without loss of quality of data recording
limitations – no direct access- due to the sequential access nature, magnetic tapes are
not suitable for storage of data that are accessed randomly
as combinations of zeros and ones
indirect interpretation- data stored are in the form of tiny,
invisible, magnetic spots hence, the contents cannot be interpreted and verified directly
environmental problems- specks of dust can cause tape reading errors
thus, tapes need to be stored in a place with properly controlled temperature and humidity
levels
uses- for applications based on sequential data processing
example- inventory master file, backing up of data stored on online storage devices such
as disk for its offline storage
archiving of data which are not used frequently but which may be used once in a while
transferring of data which are not used frequently but which may be used once in a while
these digits are called binary digits or bits, in short
magnetic disk – magnetic disk are the most popular direct access storage medium
magnetic disk are smooth metal plates coated on both sides with a thin film of magnetic
material
a set of such magnetic plates are fixed spindle one below the other to make up a disk pack
the disk pack is sealed and mounted on a disks drive
such a disk drive consists of a motor to rotate a disk pack about its axis at a speed of about
three thousand six hundred revolutions per minute
the drive also has a set of magnetic heads mounted on arms
data are recorded on a disk in the form of tiny, invisible, magnetized and non-magnetized
spots, representing ones and zeros, on the coded surface of the disk
these are only symbols whose meaning vary with applications
each surface is divided into concentric circles known as tracks and each track into several
sectors
there are typically between ten and hundred sectors per track and these may be either
fixed or of variable length
the set of corresponding tracks on all the surface of a disk pack forms a logical cylinder
a set of disk drives are connected to a disk controller
the disk controller aspects command from the computer and position the read write heads
of the specified disk for reading or writing
the read write heads of the disk system are either fixed or movable
each read write head consists of a magnetic yoke and a magnetizing coil
in digital circuits, a flip-flop is a term referring to an electronic circuit, a bi-stable
this module describes about the storage of data in a computer system
digital information can be recorded on the magnetic film by applying current pulses of
suitable polarity
in order to access information from a disk, the disk address of the desired data has to
be specified in terms of surface number, track number and sector number
all magnetic disk are round platters
they come in different sizes, use different types of packaging and are made of rigid metal
or flexible plastic
the magnetic disk can be broadly classified into two- floppy disk and hard disk
floppy disk are individually packaged in protective envelopes or plastic cases, whereas, hard
disk are packaged individually or in multiples in cartridges or contamination free containers
multi-vibrator that has two stable states and thereby is capable of serving as one bit
depending on the type of packaging, hard disk are further classified into zip bernoulli
disk, disk packs and winchester disk
access time – disk access time is the interval between the times of a computer makes a request
for a transfer of data from a disk system to primary storage and the time this operation
is completed
this access time depends on the following three parameters
first one, transfer rate – it is seek time
the time required to move the read write head to the proper track
second, latency – the amount of time that elapses after the head is positioned over
the correct track until the starting position of the addressed sector passes under the read
of memory
write head
third, the rate at which data is read from or written to a disk
advantages- support direct access of data making them more suitable for wide range of
applications
due to random access property, magnetic disk are often used by multiple users simultaneously
as a shared device
suitable for both online and offline storage of data, example, winchester disk and disk
packs are often used as online secondary storage devices
floppy disk and zip disk are used as offline secondary storage devices
except for fixed type winchester disk, storage capacity is virtually unlimited
flip-flop is the common name given to two state devices which offer basic memory for
due to low cost and high data recording densities, cost for bit of storage is low
data transfer rate for a magnetic disk system is normally higher
magnetic disks are less vulnerable to data corruption due to unfavorable environmental
conditions
limitations- although magnetic disk can be used for both types of applications, use of
magnetic disk is less efficient than magnetic tapes
more difficult to maintain security of information stored on those magnetic disk that are used
as shared, online secondary storage devices as compared to information stored on magnetic
tape
a disk crash or drive failure often result in loss of entire data stored on it
sequential logic operations
not easily portable
winchester disk and disk pack
uses- for applications that require, random data processing, as a shared, online secondary
storage device, as a backup device for offline data storage, transferring of data and programs
between two computers that are not linked together
optical disk – during the last few years, optical disk proved to be a promising, random
access medium, for high capacity secondary storage because it can store extremely large
amount of data in a limited space
an optical disk storage system consists of a rotating disk coated with a thin metal or
some other material that is highly reflective
flip-flops are heavily used for digital data storage and transfer and are commonly used
optical disk are also known as laser disk or optical laser disk because they use laser
beam technology for data read or write
an optical disk has one long track starting at the outer edge and spiraling inward to
the center
this spiral track is ideal for reading large blocks of sequential data such as audio or video
the spiral track of an optical disk is split up into equal length sectors regardless of
the position of a sector from the center
cost per bit of storage is very low for optical disk because of their low cost and high storage density
the storage capacity of an optical disk equal to number of sectors multiplied by number
of bytes per sector
in locations called registers for the storage of binary numerical data
an optical disk drive uses laser beam technology for recording or reading of data on an optical
disk surface
it has two laser beam sources
one laser beam of greater intensity is used to write data by etching microscopic pits
on the disk surface and another laser beam of lesser intensity is used to read data from
the light sensitive disk surface
to write data, laser beam is turned on and off at a varying rate due to which tiny pits
are burnt into the metal coating of the disk surface along its tracks
to read data, the less powerful laser beam is focused on the disk surface
this beam is strongly reflected by recorded surface known as land and weakly reflected
the term flip-flop has come to mostly denote non-transparent clock or edge triggered devices,
by the burnt surface known as pit, producing patterns of on and off reflections that are
converted into electronic signals of binary ones and zeros by sensor
a mechanical forward backward moving read write access arm with a laser source to place
the unit to the desired place on the optical disk
types of optical disk – optical disk are in different sizes and capacities
commonly used types of optical disk are- cd rom – a compact disc also known as a cd
is an optical disk used to store digital data
it was originally developed to store sounds recordings exclusively
philips, which define a non-volatile optical computer data storage, but later it also allowed
the preservation of other types of data
while the simpler transparent ones are often referred to as latches
for the first few years of its existence, the compact disc was a medium used purely
for audio
however, in nineteen eighty five, the cd rom standards was established by sony and medium
used the same physical format as audio compact disc readable by a computer with a cd rom
drive
standard cds have a diameter of one twenty millimeter and can hold up to eighty minutes
of audio that is seven hundred mb of data
a cd is made from one point two millimeter thick, almost pure polycarbonate plastic and
weighs approximately sixteen grams
from the center outward, components are- at the center, spindle
a flip-flop is usually controlled by one or two control signals and or a gate or clock signal
hole, fifteen millimeter
the first transition area, that is, clamping ring and the clamping area, stacking ring
and the second transition area or the mirror band, the information or the data area and
the rim
the technology was eventually adapted and expanded to encompass the data storage cd rom
write once audio and data storage, cd-r, rewriteable media cd rw, video compact disc vcd, super
video compact disc svcd, photo cd, picture cd, cd-i and enhanced cd
worm that is cd-r- compact disc recordable is a type of write once read many, worm, compact
disc format that allows one time recording on a disc
cd-r retains a high level of compatibility with standard cd reader
the output often includes the complement as well as the normal output
from this module a learner is expected to achieve the following- understands the role
a standard cd-r is a one point two millimeter thick disc made of polycarbonate with a one
twenty millimeter or eighty millimeter diameter
the one twenty millimeter disc has a storage capacity of seventy four minutes of audio
or six fifty mib of data
most cds are on the market have an eighty minute capacity
the polycarbonate disc contains a spiral groove called the pregroove because it is molded
in before data are written to the disc to guide the laser beam upon writing and reading
information
cd rw- cd rw, compact disc rewriteable is a rewriteable optical disk format known as
cd erasable that is cd-e during its development, cd rw was introduced in nineteen ninety seven
logic gates are electronic circuit which operate on one or more binary input signals to produce
cd rw disc need to be blank before reuse
different blanking methods can be used, including full blanking, in which the entire surface
of the disc is cleared and fast blanking, in which, only meta data areas are cleared
prior to the introduction of the cd rw technology, a standard for magnet-o-optical recordable
and erasable cds called cd-mo was introduced in nineteen eighty eight
video cd- vcd, view cd and compact disc digital video is a standard digital format for storing
video media on a cd
vcds are playable in dedicated vcd players, most modern dvd video players, personal computers
and some video game consoles
the vcd standard was created in nineteen ninety three by sony, philips, matsushita and jvc
standard binary output signals
and is referred to as to the white book standard
overall picture quality is intended to be comparable to vhs video
poorly compressed vcd video can sometimes be lower quality than vhs video but vcd exhibits
block artifacts rather than analog noise, and does not deteriorate further with each
use which may be preferable

hope you enjoyed this session
come back with another session, until then, goodbye, take care
computer circuits are build up using combinations of different types of logic gates to perform
the necessary operation
a variety of logic gates are commonly used in digital computer system
each gate has a distinct logic symbol and its operation is described with the help of
an algebraic expression
the input-output relationship of a gate can be expressed in tabular form called truth table
the various logic gates are and gate, or gate and not gate
of computer in information processing, familiarizes the storage cell, flip-flops and gates, understands
main memory – a memory or store is required in a computer to store programs and the data
processed by programs
a memory is made up using large number of cells or location and each cell is capable
of storing one bit
the cells may be organized so that it can store a fixed number of bits called word length
of memory
each word has a built-in and unique number assigned to it
the number is called the address of the location and is used to identify the location
each location can hold either a data item or an instruction and it’s address remains
the same regardless of its contents
the concept of main memory, learns about the classification of data storage devices, understands
the storage cells are made up of flip-flops fabricated with transistors
these cells are called binary cells and each cell can store a binary digit
the following figure illustrates a storage cell
the cell has an input data line on which the symbol to be written is sent to the cell
to write the symbol into the cell, a write control signal is sent through the write line
if the content of the cell is to be read, a read control signal is sent on the read
line and the content of the cell may be sensed on the output line
entering data into a storage location is destructive or volatile and retrieving data is non-destructive
by appropriate variation in the interconnection of binary memory cells, it is possible to
organize different types of memories
the various techniques for accessing stored information, get an idea about the uses of
the simplest organization of a set of cells is shown here
in this organization, three cells are interconnected in such a manner that the write control lines
of all the cells are connected together
the read control lines are also connected together
the bits to be written in each cell are fed to the appropriate input data lines
when the write control signal is applied to the write line, these input bits are written
in the individual cells
the previous contents in the cells are automatically erased when the information is written
in order to read the contents of the cell, a read signal is applied to the common read line
the contents of the cell appear on the respective output data lines
different storage media
this interconnection of cells is called the register
this register stores three bits
a group of registers may be interconnected to form a memory
the two basic types of semiconductor memories are the random access memory ram and the read
only memory rom
ram is a read write memory
information can be written into and read from a ram
it is a volatile memory
the information written to it, is retained in it as long as the power supply is on
when the power supply is interrupted, the stored information is lost
computer data storage often called storage or memory refers to computer components, devices
the basic storage cell of a ram is a flip-flop fabricated with transistors
rams come in two varieties- static ram and dynamic ram
a rom is a semiconductor memory device used to store information which is permanent in
nature and has become an important part of any digital systems because of its low cost,
high speed and data non-volatility
the information stored in it is not lost even if the power supply goes off
it is used for permanent storage
roms are much cheaper as compared to rams
depending on the programming process employs, the roms are categorized as- mask programmable
rom, programmable rom and erasable programmable rom
and recording media that retain digital data used for computing for some interval of time
mass storage – memory usually refers to a form of semiconductor storage known as random
access memory or ram and sometimes other forms of fast but temporary storage
similarly, storage today more commonly refers to mass storage- optical disk, forms of magnetic
storage like hard disk and other types of slower than ram but of a more permanent nature
historically, memory and storage were respectively called primary storage and secondary storage
or auxiliary memory
the terms online and offline are often used to describe devices that can be either attached
or detached from a machine
online means that, the device or information is connected and is readily available to the
machine without human intervention
there are basically two types of data which a computer can handle, characters and numbers
welcome to the session on secondary storage devices
optical disk are on the way out in consumer devices, external hard drives are used for
backing up systems and thumb drives of useful most conventional file transfers
network storage - these types of devices include shared file servers, network accessible storage,
that is nas devices and cloud services
all of these take the idea of an external hard drive and change the connection method
from usb to a full network connection
you add file servers to your local domain and have total control over who access which
files on your server
you can plug an nas device to your router and every computer on your local network can
store files on it for a more informal file sharing method
to secondary memory
you can also use services like dropbox, box and skydrive to put the files on other vendors
servers and access them through the internet
according to the technology used the secondary storage devices can be categorized into three
such as magnetic, optical and solid state
magnetic devices have a tape or disk surface, which can be magnetized with the pattern of
north and south areas to represent the binary data
as the changing magnetic surface moves passed a read head, it reads the alternating pattern
of tiny current changes as binary digits
examples include hard drives, floppy disk and magnetic tape
optical devices use a circular disk surface where a spiral pattern of reflective and non
secondary memory is a memory of more permanent nature
reflective areas represents the binary data as the disk surface move passed it
a low power laser beam tracks the spiral pattern and reflects the laser light onto a light detector
the patterns of bright and non bright reflections form a pattern which is read as binary digits
the commonly used optical devices include cd rom, cd r, and cd rw disk along with the
higher capacity dvd and blu ray equivalents
solid state devices store the binary data on semiconductor material, where a pattern
of all of semiconductor switches represents the binary data
solid state drive is an example of this type of device
we have already seen the storage organization advantages and limitations of the commonly
used magnetic and optical devices
the way people at home and in business are using storage and compute functions is changing
the hard drives are a type of magnetic media, in which binary data is stored on the magnetized
surface in a circular pattern on the surface of flat circular plates called platters
these rotate at very high speed, and the read write head moves from side to side to load
and save data
files are stored on the disk in clusters arranged along tracks and spanning one or more sectors
the tracks and sectors are created when the hard disk is first formatted, and this must
take place before the disk can be used
for a drive to read data from a disk, the read write head must move sideways to align
with the correct track and then wait until the correct sector rotates round until underneath
it
the way of manufacturers designing and marketing their computer products
the floppy disk are rarely used now but three point five inch floppy disk drive can still
be found on some early computers, the floppy disk for a pc needed to be formatted before
they were used, but were usually pre-formatted to hold one point four four mb of data to
store about three fifty pages of a four text
just like the tape in a tape recorder, the data is returned to or read from the tape
as it passes the magnetic heads
this means that it is necessary to start at the beginning of the tape and search for the
data as the tape goes past the head serial axis which is considerably slower than random
axis, being able to jump to a selected selection of data
solid state drives – solid state drives are a form of flash memory it is therefore
until recently, partially all desktop and laptop computers had optical storage devices
non-volatile like rom, so the contents are not lost when there is no power supply, but
able to be written to as in ram
applications - solid state devices can replace the hard drive as the main secondary storage
device in the computer where really large storage capacities are not required
they form the main storage for pda, smartphones and some high end laptop models
advantages - solid state devices offer faster read write times than either magnetic or optical
storage devices
they are also silent and resistant to physical shock, which makes them ideal as portable
storage devices
they offer relatively high storage capacities and data can be read directly from any part
such as cd, dvd or blu ray players internally installed
of the device that is random access
they also can be designed to use the same interface as hard drives, thus easily replacing
them in many applications
the disadvantages - the storage capacity cannot yet much that of modern hard drives
relatively expensive compared to magnetic media in terms of data capacity per unit price
so they tend to be smaller capacity than magnetic storage devices
now let's have a quick look at what we have discussed in this session
to understand the importance of secondary storage devices in the computing field, if
the data is to be stored in a permanent manner, we need to use secondary storage devices
all quantities like length, volume etcetera represented in computer memory is measured
however, this has changed with the trend of sleeker, smaller and faster products linked
with standard units
the standard units are bit, byte and word
in this module, we have revisited the magnetic and optical storage and an idea about solid
state drive is given
hope you enjoyed this session
see you next time bye
to the growth of the internet and cloud computing services
memory units - all quantities physical or otherwise are measured in units
just as we use centimeters or meters as the unit of length and grams as the unit of mass,
computers are used to perform a variety of tasks in different realms of life such as
computer memory is measured with standard units
digital computers have only two states on and off
these two values are represented by two different voltage levels within the circuit
each of these values is called binary digit or bit and can be considered as a symbol for
a piece of information
the smallest unit of data a computer can deal is a bit but usually do not deal with single bit
a bit can contain either a zero or a one
usually a group of eight bits called a byte is considered to be unit
with eight bits a byte can have two raise to eight that is two fifty six bit patterns,
and hence the presence two fifty six different symbols
science, engineering, business, education, entertainment and many other fields
any binary number between eight zeros and eight ones can be represented in a byte
in modern computers grouping of two or four bytes called computer words can represent
larger information
the other units used to represent computer memory are bit, byte, kilobyte, megabyte,
gigabyte and terabyte
primary and secondary storage - primary storage is internal in your computer and is designed
to hold data temporarily
random access memory or ram and cache are examples of primary storage and have the fastest
data access speed
secondary storage sometimes called auxiliary or external storage are internal or external
we all know that it is the smart machine that work at high speed can handle a huge amount
components, such as hard drives, solid state drives, optical drives, and thumb drives,
also called flash drives or usb drives
although ram can store the data and program files used when a computer system is actually
running, it is volatile, meaning it losses its contents without a power source
a secondary storage device is needed in a computer system to store data and program
files when the power supply is turned off
secondary storage must therefore be non volatile, meaning it retains its contents without the
need for a power supply
secondary storage may also need to have a larger storage capacity than ram if it needs
to store operating system files, other program files and data files
of data with supreme accuracy and after all have the ability to carry out a specified
when a computer is running, the programs and data files in use are copied from the secondary
storage into ram referred to as loading so the cpu can access them at an accessible speed
any changes to the files are copied back to the secondary storage from ram before the
computer is closed down referred to as saving
if you have a comparison of primary and secondary memory, the following points can be noted
it is always slower to access data from secondary storage than from primary memory, data is
stored in secondary storage is permanent it is not lost when the computer is turned off
secondary storage typically has a far higher storage capacity then ram
importance of secondary storage devices - in the previous session, we had an overview of
the different access mechanisms such as direct and random used in storage devices
sequence of operations without any human intervention
secondary storage devices are a very useful component to have many times, they also go
by the name external hard drives
different people use them for different purposes, as they are very versatile
the majority of secondary storage devices are used for a very simple task, backing up data
most likely your computer is filled with all of your music, pictures, videos and other
items of value
you may also have expensive applications that you paid for loaded into it
backing up your data is always recommended in case of a hard drive crash on your computer
another common use of secondary storage devices is to serve as
an external hard drive if the hard drive on your computer is getting full, why not add an external hard drive
the memory plays an important role in helping cpu to process the data by holding the required
this simplifies the process of upgrading more storage as you do not have to crack up on
your computer
simply add a secondary storage device via usb port and you now have up to two terabytes
of extra space added to your computer
this is also an ideal solution for notebook users who are unable to upgrade the hard drives
in their computers
many businesses will connect secondary storage devices to their network
this acts as an easy way for them to share files
when you connect a secondary storage device to your network, you can set up specific permissions
for anyone on your network to connect to it
instructions and data holding the intermediate results and to store the output
secondary storage devices are becoming more and more portable as technology progresses
a very popular use of secondary storage devices has becoming using them to transport data
type of storage - modern computers have dedicated ram for running programs and large volume
of storage to record program outputs and to store data when not in use
large volume storage trade access speed for capacity and it comes in three broad categories,
internal to the computer, external to the computer and storage that is access to via
and network
internal storage - internal storage is a device housed inside the computer
it comes in two broad types, spinning disk and hard disk drives and solid state hard drives
spinning disk drives have platters of magnetic material that get written and rewritten by
computer memory refers to the electronic holding place where the processor can reach quickly
a drive head
solid state disk use flash memory to store data
solid state disk drives are much faster than spinning platters, and can fit unusual case
shapes, like the macbook air or ultrabook for example, solid state drives are much more
expensive for a given capacity than a conventional spinning disk drive
external storage - external storage devices include removable media like optical disk
and sd cards and usb connected flash drives called thumb drives
because of their size and externally connected hard drives
external storage is used to backup computer data, move files between a computer and a
different machine without a network and make copies of something for other uses
when we talk about memory, it generally refers to the primary memory only, and storage refers
welcome all, in this module, we will discuss the manipulation of data within a computer
the data and instructions stored in the primary memory are transferred to the alu as and when
needed, intermediate results generated in the alu are temporarily transferred back to
the primary storage, thus data may be moved from primary memory to alu and back to primary
memory several times during the processing
after the completion of processing, the final results are transferred to the primary storage
the type and the number of arithmetic and logic operations that a computer can perform
are determined by the engineering design of the alu
the input and output of the alu is shown in the following figure
the alu contains various functional units such as adder unit to add signed integer numbers,
shift unit to perform shift operations, logic unit for boolean logical operations, multiple
data based on the instructions from user or from program
unit for multiply integers, division unit for integer division, branch control unit
for comparisons, floating point unit for floating point addition, subtraction, multiplication,
etcetera, decimal arithmetic unit for bcd, adders and subtractors
control unit - the control unit selects and interprets program instructions and then coordinates
their execution
it has some special purpose registers such as program control registers, instruction
registers, memory address registers, memory buffer registers, etcetera and a decoder to
perform these activities
each instruction is accompanied by microcode that is very basic directions that tells the
cpu how to execute the instruction
processing devices - the transformation of raw data into information is called processing
since, the control unit controls and coordinates the entire computer system, it can be thought
of as the central nervous system for all other components of the computer
it obtains instructions from the program stored in the primary memory, interprets the instructions
and issue signals that cause other units of the computer system to execute them
the functions of control unit are summarized below
fetches the instruction from the primary memory at the location pointed to by the program
counter register, decodes the instruction in the instruction register
execute the instruction by means of sequencing a series of control signals to other components
of the cpu
controls all data transfers between various components both external and internal
to perform this operation, the computer uses two main components the processor and memory
in general, controls the entire computer by means of the timing and control unit
the functions of the control unit can be considered as two basic tasks
they are, sequencing, control unit causes the cpu to step through a series of micro
operations in the proper sequence based on the program being executed
execution- the control unit causes each micro operation to be performed, for the control
unit to perform its function, it must have inputs that allow it to determine the state
of the system and outputs that allow it to control the behavior of the system
these are external specifications of the control unit, the control unit must have the logic
required to perform its sequencing and execution functions internally
the general model of the control unit is given below
the processor or the central processing unit or the cpu is the brain of the computer
here clock which generates clock pulse, instruction register, the op code of the current instruction
is used to determine which micro operations are to be performed, flags to determine the
status of the cpu and the outcome of the previous alu operation
control signals from control bus, these are the signal inputs to the control unit to interpret
and acknowledgment
control signals within the cpu, these are output signals from control unit and of
two types
those two cause data to be moved from one register to another and that activate specific
alu functions
control signals to control bus, these are also output signals
in a personal computer, the processor usually consists of one or more specialized chips
these are of two types, one to memory and the other to io modules
when the entire cpu that is both control unit and arithmetic and logic unit is contained
on a single tiny silicon chip, it's called a microprocessor
the stored program concept - the idea of storing a computer's program in its main memory is
called the stored program concept and has become the standard approach now
the computer uses these programs by copying the instructions from memory into the control
unit as and when required, each instruction is decoded and executed in the control unit
the order in which the instructions are fetched from memory corresponds to the order in which
they are stored in memory
the idea was introduced in the late nineteen forties by john von neumann, who proposed
called microprocessors
that a program can be electronically stored in binary form in a memory device, so that
instructions could be modified by the computer as determined by intermediate computational results
john w mauchley and j preper eckert contributed to this idea which enabled digital computers
to become much more flexible and powerful
also, engineers in england built the first stored program computer, the manchester mark
one shortly before the americans build at work, both operational in nineteen forty nine
program execution - to get an idea of how the overall execution process takes place,
the working of control unit is to be thoroughly understood
within the control unit, there are two special purpose registers, the instruction register
and the program counter
the microprocessor is plugged into the computer's motherboard
the instruction register holds the instruction being executed
the program counter contains the address of the next instruction to be executing
by this, the machine keeps track of the program being executed
the control unit accomplishes its tasks by continuously repeating a three step process
algorithm called mission cycle
the steps in the mission cycle are fetch, decode and execute
fetch - the control units request the main memory to provide it with the instruction
that is stored at the address indicated by the program counter
thus, the fetch process involves retrieving the contents of two memory cells from main memory
then the instructions received from memory is placed in the instruction register and
the motherboard is a rigid rectangular card containing the circuitry that connects the
increments the program counter by two so that the counter now contains the address of the
next instruction stored in memory
decode - at this step, the control unit decodes the instruction in the instruction register
it involves making the operand field into its proper components based on the instructions op code
execute - the control unit then execute the instruction with the help of appropriate circuitry
to perform the requested task
for example, consider the load instruction to load from memory
the control unit sends the appropriate signals to main memory waits for main memory to send
the data and then places the data in the requested register, then check the instructions if it
is an arithmetic operation, the control unit activates the appropriate circuitry in the
processor to other hardware
alu with the character registers as inputs and waits for the alu to compute the answer
and place it in the appropriate register
once the instruction which is in the instruction register has been executed, the control unit
again starts the mission cycle with the fetch step
since the program counter increments at the end of each fetch, it provides the control
unit with the correct address again and again
in short, the execution of a program stored in memory involves the same process we use
while following a detailed list of instructions
as we keep the place by marking the instructions, the computer keeps its place by using the
program counter after determining which instruction is to be executed next we would read the instruction
in modern computers, these devices are built directly into the motherboard
computer is basically an information processing system
and extract its meaning then we may perform the task and return to the list of the next
instruction, in the same manner the computer executes the instruction in its instruction
register and then continues with another fetch
the steps for execution of an instruction by the cpu - first, control unit gets the
address of the next instruction to be executed from program control register and gets the
instruction from the specified memory address into the instruction register
second, the control unit sends the operation part of the instruction to the decoder and
memory address register
third, the instruction is interpreted by the decoder and the control unit sends signal
to the appropriate unit
some of the newer microprocessors are large and complex enough to require their own dedicated
four, after each instruction is executed the address of the next instruction to be executed
is loaded into the pc register automatically and above steps are repeated
process speed and different types of processes - the control unit operations and the alu
operations are high speed operations
these operations are synchronized by a built in electronic clock known as system clock
instructions are fetched, decoded and executed according to the clock cycles
one cycle is the time it takes to perform one operation, like moving a byte of data
from one memory location to another
for each fetch, decode and execute several clock cycles are required thus, if the clock
cycle is short, the processor will be fast
circuit boards, which plug into a special slot in the motherboard
that is the speed at which an instruction is executed is directly related to the computer's
built in clock speed, which is equal to the number of pulses produced per second
most of the today's computers have clock speed in between point five gigahertz to four gigahertz
types of processors - cisc processors, one of the earlier goals of the cpu designers
was to provide more instructions in the instruction set of a cpu to ensure that the cpu supports
more functions directly
every additional instruction in the instruction set of a cpu requires the necessary hardware
circuitry, which makes the cpu more complex
another goal of cpu designers was to optimize the usage of expensive memory
to achieve this, the designers tried to include more instructions in memory by introducing
the information processing cycle - different types of operations are required to process
the concept of variable length instructions, such as half word, one and a half word etcetera
cpus were also designed to support different types of addressing modes, cpus with a large
instruction set, variable length instructions, and a variety of addressing modes are set
to be complex instruction set computer or cisc architecture even though they make it
easier to do translate high level language to machine language, they are complex and
expensive to produce
the risc processors - in nineteen eighties, it was realized that many instructions supported
by a cisc based cpu are rarely used
hence, it is modified by implementing only some basic set of instructions and some of
the more frequently used instructions in the hardware circuitry of the cpu
the data and convert it into useful information
other complex instruction can be implemented in software by using the basic set of instructions
also, all the instructions are made of uniform length, so that decoding and executing the
instructions become simple and fast
here a notable changes all the instructions are designed in such a way that they retrieve
operands stored in registers in cpu and not from memory
this resulted in producing faster and less expensive processes by speeding up the computation
and reducing the complexity of handling a number of address modes
cpus with a small instruction set, fixed length instructions and reduced references to memory
to retrieve operands are said to have reduced instruction set computer or risc architecture
they are faster for most applications, less complex and less expensive to produce than
the set of procedures the computer follows to receive data process data according to
cisc processes
but the programmers should implement complex computations by combining simple instructions
epic processors - the epic or the explicitly parallel instruction computing technology
allows the software to communicate explicitly to the processor when operations can be done
in parallel
thus, it is different from traditional processors and uses tighter coupling between the compiler
and the processor
processors based on epic architecture are simpler and more powerful than cisc or risc processors
these are designed for high end servers and workstations
multi core processors - recent trend for making processes faster is to build multi core processor
instruction from program or user display the result that is the information to the user
chips, instead of powerful single core processor chips
the multi core chips do not necessarily run as fast as the highest performing single core
models, but they improve overall performance by handling more work in parallel
in a multi core processor, each core has its independent cache providing the operating
system with sufficient resources to handle multiple applications in parallel
chip makers like intel, amd, ibm and sun have already introduced multi core chips for servers,
desktops and laptops
the current multi core chips are dual core that is two cores per chip, quad core four
cores per chip, eight cores per chip and sixteen cores per chip
the experts say that multi core processors are useful in server class machines, but not
and store it are called the information processing cycle
so good on desktop systems until software vendors develop more multi threaded software
this module gives an overview of how the data are manipulated and the main component that
is the cpu of the computer used for manipulation of this data
this module also covers the topics such as the information processing cycle, the steps
for execution of a program etcetera
and this module concludes by referring to the speed of the processes and some of the
different types of processes
before we conclude please try to answer the following questions
define the term data manipulation?
what are the four phases of the information processing cycle?
the information processing cycle has four parts, each part consists of one or more components
explain mission cycle?
what are the functions of a cpu in a computer?
what are the main functions of alu?
what is it register?
what are the different functions of register?
name the commonly used registers of a computer?
what is meant by the speed of a processor?
how does it relate to the clock speed?
compare between cisc and risc processes?
what is a multi-core processor?
input - at this phase, the computer accepts data from some sources, such as user or program
processing - during this phase of the cycle, the computer's processing components perform
the processing of data and storing of information is referred to as data manipulation
actions on the data according to the instruction from the user or program
output - during this step, the computer may be displaying the results of its processing
the output is in the form of text, number, graphics or sound
the output can also be sent to a printer or transferred to another computer through some
network
storage - here, the computer stores the results on a disk, tape or some other storage medium
which is more permanent in nature
output and storage are optional
central processing unit - the central processing unit or the cpu is called the brain of any
computer system
now we'll have a detailed look on data manipulation
all major calculations and comparisons in a computer are made inside the cpu
the cpu activates and controls the operations of other units of a computer system
the major structural components of the cpu are registers, arithmetic and logic unit and
control unit
the central processing unit and the memory architecture is given in the following figure
these components are connected by a bus, which is a collection of parallel lines for transferring
address, data and control signals
buses can be both internal and external to the cpu
the external buses connect the cpu to memory and input, output devices
the primary function of the cpu is to execute sequences of instructions
data consists of individual facts or pieces of information that by themselves may not
registers - registers are special memory location used as the temporary storage location within
the cpu where data fetched from the memory can be held
within the cpu when the instructions are interpreted and executed there is a movement of information
between different parts of the computer
so, the registers speed at the rate of information transfer
most computers use several types of registers, each of these registers has the ability to
receive information hold it temporarily and to pass it on to as directed by the control unit
the length of the register is equal to the number of bits it can store
most of the modern cpus have thirty two bit or sixty four bit registers which means the
register can store thirty two bits or sixty four bits
be of much sense
the length of the register is often referred to as its word size, the total number of register
varies from computer to computer, but there are some special registers common to all computers
they are memory address register
it holds the address of the active memory location, it is loaded from program control
register, when an instruction is read from memory
memory buffer register - it holds the contents of the accessed memory word, the instruction
word placed in this resistor is sent to the instruction register
a word to be stored in a memory location must be transferred first to mbr from where it
is returned in memory
it also holds the information which is read from any memory location to where it is actually read
the computer processes these data in different ways and converts them into useful information
program control register - it holds the address of the next instruction to be executed
in normal programming scenario, the instructions are stored in consecutive memory locations
and are executed in sequence
but for the branch instructions, the next instructions address will be transferred to
pc register
accumulator register - it holds the data to be operated upon the intermediate results
and the results of processing, it is used during the execution after instructions
most of the computers have more than one accumulator register
instruction register or i - it holds the current instruction being executed
when the instruction is stored in this register the operation part and the address part of
like any other machine, a computer is a collection of parts, and they are categorized according
the instruction are separated, the address part is sent to the mar and the operation
is sent to the control unit
input output register or io
it is used to communicate with input output devices
the input device transfers all the input information to this register and all output information
to any output device are transferred to their register
arithmetic and logic unit - the actual execution of the instruction take place at the arithmetic
and logic unit or the alu of the computer system
the execution of an instruction is the result of the data processing operation which is
the function of alu
to the kinds of work they do
the alu has some special purpose registers such as accumulator and necessary circuitry
to carry out all arithmetic and logic operations supported by the cpu
the alu consists of the instructions that is used by the control unit to request an
activity within the alu and is capable of all arithmetic operations such as addition,
subtraction, multiplication and division
all logic operations such as less than, equal to, greater than etcetera and boolean operations
such as and, or, and or etcetera
another collection of operations available within most alus allows the contents of registers
to be moved to the right or the left within the register which is known as either shift
or rotate operations
during information processing, the computer processing components perform actions on the
data representation, this module describes about the representation of data while storing
the first ten digits are the digits of the decimal number system zero, one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight and nine the remaining six digits are denoted by a, b,
d, e and f representing the decimal values ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen and
fifteen respectively
the largest single digit is f which has a decimal equivalent of fifteen, each position
in a hexadecimal number system represents a power of the base sixteen
to the left of the hexadecimal point each digit from the right to the left have the
positional values sixteen raised to zero, sixteen raised to one, sixteen raised to two
etcetera and the right of the hexadecimal point each digit from left to the right have
the positional values sixteen raised to minus one, sixteen raised to minus two, sixteen
two valued signals can readily be represented, stored and transmitted for example, as the
raised to minus three etcetera
hence, the column weights of the hexadecimal number are sixteen raised to n etcetera sixteen
cube, sixteen square, sixteen raised to one, sixteen raised to zero point, sixteen raised to
minus one, sixteen raised to minus two, sixteen raised to minus three etcetera sixteen raised
to minus n
the decimal equivalent of the hexadecimal number one three bf point five a is one into
sixteen cube plus three into sixteen square plus b into sixteen raised to one plus f into
sixteen raised to zero plus five into sixteen raised to minus one plus a into sixteen raised
to minus two which is equal to four thousand ninety six plus seven sixty eight plus one
seventy six plus fifteen plus point three one two five plus point zero three nine zero
presence or absence of a whole in a punched card as a high or low voltage on a wire or
six which is equal to five thousand fifty five point three five one five six
each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits or bits called a nibble and the primary
use of hexadecimal notation is as a human friendly representation of binary coded values
in computing and digital electronics
for example, byte values can range from zero to two fifty five in decimal but may be more
conveniently represented as two hexadecimal digits in the range zero zero through ff
hexadecimal is also commonly used to represent computer memory addresses
generally octal and hexadecimal number systems are used as a shortcut notation for binary
conversion between number systems - numbers expressed in decimal number system are much
more meaningful to users than are values expressed in any other number system
as a magnetic domain oriented clockwise or counterclockwise
any number in one number system can be expressed in any other number system, there are certain
methods to convert a number in a particular number system to any other number system
computer codes - not only numbers but letters and other symbols can also be represented
using binary digits
combinations of binary digits that represent numbers, letters or other symbols are called
digital codes
there are different types of codes come into existence to represent numerical and alphanumerical
characters
representing text - in general two state devices are used as physical devices to store and
process data in computers, the two states are on and off
representing information as bit patterns
thus, all the data to be processed and stored in the form of text is normally represented
in some code of two different symbols zero and one to represent each state
each of the different symbols in the text like letters of the alphabet and punctuation
marks is assigned a unique bit pattern
thus, the text is represented as a long string of bits in which the successive patterns represent
the successive symbols in the original text
in the nineteen forties and nineteen fifties many such codes were designed and used but
had severe communication problems
to alleviate this situation the american national standards institute ansi adopted the american
standard code for information interchange or ascii
the basic unit for representing discrete information in a computer is a bit, one bit can be considered
this code uses bit patterns of length seven to represent the upper and lowercase letters
of the english alphabet, punctuation symbols, the digits zero through nine and a limited
number of control information such as line fields, carriage returns and tabs
today ascii is often extended to an eight bit per symbol format by adding a zero at
the most significant end of each of the seven bit patterns, this technique not only produces
a code in which each pattern fits conveniently into a typical byte size memory cell but also
provides one twenty eight additional bit patterns
although ascii has been the dominant code for many years other more extensive codes
capable of representing documents in a variety of languages are now competing for popularity
one of these unicode was developed through the cooperation of several of the leading
as the information necessary for selecting one out of two possibilities, each unique
manufacturers of hardware and software
this code uses a unique pattern of sixteen bits to represent each symbol, as a result
unicode consists of sixty five thousand five thirty six different bit patterns which is
enough to represent the text in chinese, japanese, hebrew etcetera
standards for a code that could compete with the unicode have been developed by the international
organization for standardization
using patterns of thirty two bits this encoding system has the potential of representing billions
of different symbols
a file consisting of a long sequence of symbols encoded using ascii or unicode is often called
a text file
string of bits may be used to represent or code a symbol
it is important to distinguish between simple text files that are manipulated by utility
programs called text editors and the more elaborate files produced by word processors,
both consists of textual material
however, a text file contains only a character by character encoding of the text, whereas
a file produced by a word processor contains numerous proprietary codes representing changes
in fonts, alignment, information etcetera
moreover word processors may even use proprietary codes rather than a standard such as ascii
or unicode for representing the text itself
representing numerical values - storing information in terms of encoded character is inefficient
when the information being recorded is purely numeric for example, the value forty five
coding of character has been standardized to facilitate exchange of recorded data between computers
is stored as encoded symbols in ascii using one byte per symbol, thus a total of sixteen
bits
moreover the largest number we could store using sixteen bits is ninety nine however
by using binary notation that is zero and one we can store any integer in the range
from zero to sixty five thousand five thirty five in these sixteen bits, thus binary notation
is used extensively for encoded numeric data for computer storage
consider the following sequence, zero zero zero zero, zero zero zero one, zero zero one
zero, zero zero one one, zero one zero zero, zero one zero one, zero one one zero, zero
one one one, one zero zero zero this sequence consists of the binary representations of
the integers zero through eight
this module focuses on encoding, text, numerical data and images, each of these techniques
by extending this counting technique we could discover that the big pattern consisting of
sixteen ones represents the value sixty five thousand five thirty five which confirms that
any integer in the range from zero to sixty five thousand five thirty five can be encoded
using sixteen bits
due to this efficiency it is common to store numeric information in a form of binary notation
rather than encoded symbols
a system called two’s compliment notation is common for storing whole numbers because
it provides a convenient method for representing negative numbers as well as positive
for representing numbers with fractional parts such as four and half or three by four another
technique called floating point notation is used
is based on the fundamental concept of binary digits or bits
and processing it in a computer system
two's complement notation - the two's complement of a binary number is obtained by adding one
to the ones complement, the ones complement is formed by simply changing all ones to zeroes
and all zeroes to ones for example, the ones complement of the binary number one one zero
one one zero one one is zero zero one zero zero one zero zero, thus the two's complement
is obtained by adding one to this number
one one zero one one zero one one is the binary number
the ones complement is zero zero one, zero zero one zero zero that is zero zero one zero
zero one zero zero plus one which is equal to zero zero one zero zero one zero one
so the two's complement is zero zero one zero zero one zero one
an alternative method of obtaining the two's complement is demonstrated for the binary
number system - a number system or numeral system is a writing system for expressing
number one one zero one one zero one one
first start at the right and write the bits as they are up to and including the first
one, next take the ones complement of the remaining bits
representing floating point values - in contrast to the storage of integers the storage of
a value with a fractional part requires that we store not only the pattern of zeros and
ones representing its binary representation but also the position of the radix point
a popular way of doing this is based on scientific notation and is called floating point notation
the following example explains floating point notation using only one byte of storage, although
machines normally use much longer patterns this eight-bit format is representative of
actual systems and serves to demonstrate the important concepts
numerals and mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set using symbols in a
first designate the high order bit of the byte as the sign bit
a zero in the side bit means that the value stored is non-negative and a one means that
the value is negative
next, divide the remaining seven bits of the byte into two groups or fields the exponent
field and the mantissa field
let us designate the three bits following the sign bit as the exponent field and the
remaining four bits as the mantissa field
suppose, a byte consists of the bit pattern zero one one zero one one one one analyzing
this pattern with the preceding format we see that the sign bit is zero, the exponent
is one one zero and the mantissa is one zero one one
consistent manner
to decode the byte we first extract the mantissa and place the radix point on its left side
obtaining one one one one
next we extract the contents of the exponent field one one zero and interpret it is an
integer stored using the three bit axis method, thus the pattern in the exponent field in
our example represents a positive two, this tells us to move the radix in our solution
to the right by two bits
a negative exponent would mean to move the radix to the left consequently we obtain one
one point one one which is the binary representation for thirty three, here the sign bit is zero
the value represented is thus non negative, represents thirty three by one
if the pattern is one one one zero one one one one the same as before except for the
number systems are basically of two types positional and non-positional systems
sign bit, the value represented would be minus thirty three by one
representing images - for an image to be processed in a computer it must be represented in a
specific form which is understood by the computer
today's computer applications involve not only the text and numeric data but also some
complex processing, they include images, audio and video
important techniques for representing images can be classified into two categories bitmap
techniques and vector techniques
in the case of bitmap techniques an image is represented as a collection of dots each
of which is called a pixel, that is picture element, a black and white image is then encoded
as a long string of bits representing the rows of pixels in the image where each bit
in the non-positional number system each symbol represents the same value regardless of its
is either one or zero depending on whether the corresponding pixel is black or white
this is the approach used by most <?>*</?> machines, this bitmap approach is generalized further
for color images where each pixel is represented by a combination of bits indicating the appearance
of that pixel, two approaches are common
in one called rgb encoding each pixel is represented as three color components a red component,
a green component and a blue component corresponding to the three primary colors of light
one byte is normally used to represent the intensity of each color component
in turn three bytes of storage are required to represent a single pixel in the original
image
a popular alternative to simple rgb encoding is to use a brightness component and two color
position in a number and the symbols are simply added to find out the value of a particular number
components, in this case the brightness component which is called the pixels luminance is essentially
the sum of the red, green and blue components together these three components contain the
information required to produce the pixel
one disadvantage of bitmap techniques is that an image cannot be rescaled easily to any
arbitrary size
essentially the only way to enlarge the image is to make the pixels bigger which leads to
a grainy appearance
vector techniques provide a means of overcoming this scaling problem, using this technique
an image is represented as a collection of lines and curves such a description leaves
the details of how the lines and curves are drawn to the device that ultimately produce
in a positional number system there are only a few symbols called digits and these symbols
the image rather than insisting that the device reproduce a particular pixel pattern
the various fonts available in today's word processing systems are usually encoded using
vector techniques in order to provide flexibility in character size resulting in scalable fonts
vector representation techniques are also popular in computer-aided design or cad systems
in which drawings of three-dimensional objects are displayed and manipulated on computer screens
communication errors - digital circuits are normally designed with extreme accuracy such
that the probability of occurring even a single error is very small but when information is
transferred back and forth among the various parts of a computer or in storage a chance
exists that the bit pattern ultimately retrieved may not be identical to the original one
particles of dirt on a magnetic recording surface or a malfunctioning circuit
represent different values depending on the position they occupy in the number
may cause data to be incorrectly recorded or read and in the case of some technologies normal background
radiation can alter patterns stored in a machines main memory
the errors take the form of undesired changes in the bits that make up the coded information
that is a one can change to a zero or a zero to one, to resolve such problems a variety
of encoding techniques have been developed to allow the detection and even the correction of errors
today because these techniques are largely built into the internal components of a computer
system they are not apparent to the personnel using the machine, nonetheless their presence
is important and represents a significant contribution to scientific research
the types of codes which only detects errors are known as error detecting codes, the types
of codes which can both detect and correct errors are known as error correcting codes
these number systems have a radix or base
error detection scheme - error detection is most commonly realized using a suitable hash
function or checksum algorithm
a hash function acts a fixed length tag to a message which enables receivers to verify
the delivered message by recomputing the tag and comparing it with the one provided
there exists a vast variety of different hash function designs, however some of them are
widely used because of either their simplicity or their suitability for detecting certain
kinds of errors
repetition codes - repetition code is according scheme that repeats the bits across a channel
to achieve error free communication, given a stream of data to be transmitted the data
is divided into blocks of bits, each block is transmitted some predetermined number of
the total number of digits available in the number system is defined as the base or radix
modern computers store and process information represented as two valued signals
times for example, to send the bit pattern one zero zero one the four bit block can be
repeated four times, thus producing one zero zero one one zero zero one one zero zero one
one zero zero one
however, if this sixteen-bit pattern was received as one zero one zero one zero zero one one
zero zero one one zero zero one where the first block is unlike the other two it can
be determined that an error has occurred
repetition codes are not very efficient and can be susceptible to problems if the error
occur in exactly the same places for each group example ten one zero one zero one zero
one zero one zero one zero one zero one zero in the previous example would be detected
as correct
of that number system
the advantage of repetition code is that they are extremely simple
parity bits - a parity bit is a bit that is added to ensure that the number of bits with
value of one is a given set of bits in all ways even or odd, parity bits are used as
the simplest error detecting code for binary digits there are two types of parity bits
even parity bit and odd parity bit
an even parity bit is set to one if the number of ones in the given set of bits is odd, thus
making the total number of ones even
an odd parity bit is set to one if the number of ones in the given set of bits is even making
the total number of ones odd
example, transmission using even parity, if the stream of data to be transmitted is one
the value of a digit in a number is determined by three considerations
zero zero one the parity bit value is calculated by <?>*</?> the bits that is the parity bit
value equal to so at the parity bits zero and since, one zero zero one zero at the receiving
end if it receives one zero zero one zero computes the parity and gets reporting correct
transmission
this mechanism enables the detection of odd number of bit errors
if an even number of bit have errors the parity bit records the correct number of ones, even
though the data is corrupt, that is for the above sequence if the data received is one
zero one zero zero, the parity bit computed will be zero and reports correct transmission
but the data is not the same
before we conclude please try to answer these questions
the digit itself, the position of the digit in the number, the base or radix of the number system
how the data is stored in a computer?
define number system
what is the importance of binary system in the realm of computers?
what is meant by computer codes?
what are the different types of data processed by a computer?
explain the methods for representing text in computers?
explain the methods of representing numerals in binary form?
how can an image be represented in digital form?
decimal system - the decimal numeral system also called base ten or occasionally denary
has ten as its base, it includes the digits from zero through nine the weighted value
for each position is as follows
ten raise to n etcetera, ten raise to three, ten raise to two, ten raise to one, ten raise
to zero, point ten raised to minus one, ten raise to minus two etcetera ten raise to minus n
each digit appearing to the left of the decimal point represents a value between zero and
nine times power of ten represented by its position in the number
these binary digits, or bits, form the basis of the digital revolution
digits appearing to the right of the decimal point represent a value between zero and nine
times an increase in negative power of ten, for example, the value seven thirty five point
one eight five is represented as follows seven into ten raised to two plus three into ten
raised to one plus five into ten raised to zero plus one into ten raised to minus one
plus eight into ten raise to minus two plus five into ten raise to minus three which is
equal to seven into ten zero plus three into ten plus five into one plus one into point
one plus eight into point zero one plus five into point zero zero one equal to seven hundred
plus thirty plus five plus point one plus point zero eight plus point zero zero five
which is equal to seven thirty five point one eight five
binary number system - the base of the binary number system is two, in this system only
the familiar decimal or base ten representation has been in use for over a thousand years
two symbols zero and one are used, each position in the binary number system represents a power
of two, the weighted value for each position is as follows
two raise to n etcetera two raise to three, two raise two, two raise to one, two raise
to zero, point two raise to minus one, two raise to minus two, etcetera two raise to
minus n
all bits to the left of the binary point have weight that are positive powers of two and
all the bits to the right of the binary point have weight that are negative powers of two
the decimal equivalent of the binary number one one zero zero one one one point zero one
one is one into two raised to five plus one into two raised to four plus zero into two
raised to three plus zero into two raised to two plus one into two raised to one plus
having been developed in india improved by arab mathematicians in the twelfth century
one into two raised to zero plus zero into two raised to minus one plus one into two
raise to minus two plus one into two raise to minus three which is equal to thirty two
plus sixteen plus zero plus zero plus two plus one plus zero plus one by four plus one
by eight which is equal to thirty two plus sixteen plus two plus one plus point two five
plus point one two five which is equal to fifty one point three seven five
the binary digit is often referred to by the abbreviation bit
a bit in computer terminology means either a zero or a one
rather than accessing individual bits in memory most computers use blocks of eight bits or
bytes as the smallest addressable unit of memory
a machine level program use memory as a very large array of bytes referred to as virtual memory
and brought to the west in the thirteenth century by the italian mathematician leonardo
every byte of memory is identified by a unique number known as its address and the set of
all possible addresses is known as the virtual address space, as indicated by its name this
virtual address space is just a conceptual image presented to the machine level program,
the actual implementation uses a combination of random access memory or ram, disk storage,
special hardware and operating system software to provide the program with what appears to
be a monolithic byte array
octal number system - the octal system has base eight, in this system there are eight
symbols are used such as zero, one, two, three, four, five, six and seven
to the left of the octal point all the bits have weights that are positive powers of eight
and all the bits to the right of the octal point have weights that are negative powers of eight
pisano better known as fibonacci
thus, the column bits of an octal number are eight raised to n etcetera eight raised to
three, eight raised to two, eight raised to one, eight raised to zero point eight raised
to minus one, eight raised to minus two, eight raised to minus three, etcetera eight raised
to minus n
here all bits to the left of the octal point have weight that are positive powers of eight
and all the bits to the right of the octal point have weight that are negative powers
of eight which is illustrated in the given example
the decimal equivalent of the octal number four zero six seven point two zero five is
four into eight cube plus zero into eight square plus six into eight raised to one plus
seven into eight raised to zero plus two into eight raised to minus one plus zero into eight
using decimal notation is natural for ten fingered humans but binary values work better
raised to minus two plus five into eight raised to minus three which is equal to two zero
four eight plus zero plus four eight plus seven plus point two five plus zero plus zero
point zero zero nine seven six five which is equal to two thousand one hundred and three
point two five nine seven six five
octal is sometimes used in computing instead of hexadecimal perhaps most often in modern
times in conjunction with file permissions under unix systems
it is also used for digital displays, octal numbers that are used in some programming
languages like c, pearl etcetera for textual or graphical representations of byte strings
hexadecimal system - in hexadecimal number system the base is sixteen since, the base
is sixteen we need sixteen single character digits or symbols
when building machines that store and process information
division by two can be accomplished by shifting the binary strings to the right, but while
shifting the sign bit will preserved
hence, the shifts that lead with sign bit unchanged are sometimes called arithmetic
shifts, but, numerous variations exist for each arithmetic operation
computer-peripheral communication- the main memory and the cpu are considered to be the
core of a computer
this core communicates with a wide variety of peripheral devices like mass storage systems,
keyboard, mouse, printers, monitors etcetera and other computer
the peripherals connected to a computer needs special communication means,* for interfacing
them with the cpu, because there exist a difference between cpu and the peripheral devices
moving the bits within the registers is commonly referred to as shift or rotate operations
the main differences are peripherals are electro-mechanical and electro magnetic devices and their manner
of operation is different from the operation of the electronic devices like cpu and memory
therefore a conversion of signal values is required
the data transfer rate of peripherals is usually slower than the transfer rate of the cpu,
and thus a synchronization mechanism may be needed
data codes and formats in peripheral differ from the word format in the cpu and memory
the operating modes of peripherals are different from each other, and each must be controlled
so as not to disturb the operation of other peripherals connected to the cpu
to resolve these differences computer systems include special hardware components between
the cpu and peripherals, to supervise and synchronize all input and output transfers
arithmetic operations- the basic arithmetic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication
these components are called interface unit, because the interface between the processor
and the peripheral devices
controller- communication between a computer and other devices is handled through an intermediator
called controller
the controller may consist of circuitry permanently mounted on the computers motherboard, or it
maybe in the form of a circuit board that plugs into a slot on the motherboard
the controller connects through cables to peripheral devices or to some connector called ports
a controller translates messages and data back and forth between forms compatible with
the internal characteristics of the computer and those of the peripheral device to which
it is connected
and division, but, subtraction is performed by negating and adding
now, it has developed the some standards such as usb and firewire, so that a single controller
is able to handle a variety of devices, rather than a different controller for each type of devices
each controller communicates with the computer by means of the same bus that connects the
computer cpu and main memory
with this arrangement, the cpu is able to communicate with the controller attached to
the bus in the same way as with main memory
direct memory access or dma- the controller is attached to a computers bus and it can
be carryout its communication with main memory, during only those times when the cpu is not
using the bus
this ability is significant factor for the computers performance and is called the direct
multiplication is repeated addition and division is repeated subtraction, hence smaller cpu’s
memory access or dma
by this, the cpu can execute a program while the controller transfers data between the
disk and the main memory
thus, the computer resources of the cpu are not wasted during data transfer which is relatively
a slow process
handshaking- the transfer of data between two computer components is often a two way
dialogue known as handshaking
here the computer and the peripheral device exchange information about the device status,
and coordinate their activities
the status word is a bit pattern that is generated by the peripheral device and sends to the controller
are designed with only add instructions or only add and subtract instructions
the status word often reflects the condition of the device
the status word is actually a bitmap and depending on the system the controller responds to this
status information, itself or make it available to the cpu
hence, the status word provides a mechanism to coordinate the communication with the peripheral devices
modes of communication- communication between computing devices is handled over two types
of path that is parallel and serial
these prefer to the manner in which signals are transferred from one to the other
in parallel communication several signals are transferred at the same time using separate lines
parallel communication is useful of transferring data rapidly but requires a relatively complex
communication path
different varieties of instructions exist for arithmetic operation
data transfer through computer's internal bus is an example for this type of communication
serial communication is the other type of data transfer which is based on transferring
signals one after the other over a single line
serial communication is popular because the data path is simpler than parallel communication
usb, firewire and ethernet connections by wire or radio broadcast are popular for serial
communication system for shorter distances
for longer distances traditional voice telephones lines are commonly used
the transfer of digital data over these lines is accomplished by first converting bit patterns
into audible tones with the help of a modem
then serially transfers these tones over the telephone system and convert the tones back
though these operations are applied on numerical values, the techniques differ for integers
into bits by another modem
for high quality long distance communication, dsl or the digital subscriber line is the
service provided by the telephone companies
dsl uses frequencies above the audible range to transfer digital data, while leaving the
lower frequency spectrum for voice communication
other systems are cable television systems and satellite links through radio broadcast
other architectures, there are some alternatives to the traditional machine architecture, some
of them are pipelining
increasing only the execution speed may not improve a computer’s performance
the actual goal is to improve the machines throughput, which is the total amount of work
and floating point values
the machine can accomplished in a given amount of time
increasing throughput without an increase in execution speed involves pipelining
it is the technique of allowing the steps in the machine cycle to overlap that is while
one instruction is being executed, the next instruction can be fetched, which means that
more than one instruction can be in the pipe at any time each at a different stage of being processed
as a result the total throughput of the machine is increased, even when the time require to
fetch and execute each individual instruction remain the same
modern machine designs use pipelining as capable of fetching several instructions at the same
time and actually executing more than one instruction at a time
multiprocessor machines- pipelining can be viewed as a first approach toward parallel processing
for integers, it requires the column by column addition, which is a straight forward method
but, it is actually in need more than one processing unit for actually need the performance
of several activities at the same time
today a variety of computers are made using this idea
one technique is to attach several processing units, each as the cpu in a single processor
machine to the same main memory
here processor can proceed independently while coordinating their actions by leading messages
to one another in the shared memory cell
the traditional architecture is single - instruction stream, single - data stream or sisd architecture
in which a single processor, executes a single instruction stream, to operate on data stored
in a single memory
but, for floating point values it should first extract the mantissa of each, shift them right
the main process of data manipulation involves three steps, searching or retrieving the instructions
that is in architecture called mimd or multiple instruction stream, multiple data stream
in which, when one processor is faced with a large task, it will store a program for
part of that task in the common memory and then request another processor to execute it
in other multiprocessor architecture that link the processor together, so that they
execute the same sequence of instructions in unison each with its own set of data
this is the single instruction stream multiple data stream architecture
these are useful in applications in which same task must be applied to each set of similar
items, within a large block of data
another approach to parallel processing is to construct large computers as combinations
of smaller machines, each with its own memory and cpu
or left according to the exponent field
within such a architecture each of the small machine is arranged with its neighbor, such
that task assign to the system can be divided among the individual machines
the original task can then be completed in much less time than would be a require by
a single processor machine
the manipulation of data involves different kinds of computational operations
the processing of data is carried out mainly by the operation within the alu
hence, this module gives an overview of the different operations such as arithmetic and
logic operations along with shift operation
this module also covers the various components and techniques involved in communication between
computer and peripheral devices, such as controller, dma and handshaking
check the sign bits and then perform the addition
this module concludes by referring to the different processor architecture
one, what are the different arithmetic operations performed by the alu?
second, what are the logic operations that cane be performed with an alu?
third, what are the importance of logical exclusive or?
fourth, compare the rotate and shift operations
fifth, what is the role of a controller in communication with peripheral devices?
sixth, compare between serial and parallel communications
seventh, what is meant by pipelining?
hope you enjoyed the session
see you next time, until then bye
again these steps are to be perform in reverse to store the result in floating point notation
since each value is internally stored in two’s complement form, it is big a complex procedure
thus, both operations are set to be addition, but the procedure varies according to the type
logic operations- the logic operations such as and, or and xor combine two input bit to
produce a single output bit
logical and- the symbol dot is used for logical and operator, the logical and operator can
be defined by listing all possible combination of logical variables a and b
and the resulting values of boolean variable c in the equation a dot b equals c, the truth
in data from memory, decode it and then execute the instruction upon the data specify
table for a logical and is given below
logical or- the symbol plus is used for logical addition
the or operation can be defined by listing all possible combinations of boolean variables
a and b, and the resulting values of the boolean variable c in the equation a plus b equals
c, the truth table for logical or is as follows
logical x or- the xor or the exclusive or produces an output of one for odd numbers
of one in the input
it is normally denoted by the symbol rounded plus, the truth table for the xor operation
is given below
these operations can be extended two operations that combine two things of bits to produce
to have a clear idea about the execution, the computational instructions must be closely examine
a single output string, by applying the basic operation to individual column bits
for example, by anding the bit patterns one zero zero one zero one one zero and one zero
zero one one zero zero results in one zero zero one zero one one zero and one zero zero
zero one one zero zero, results in one zero zero zero zero one zero zero
the or operation and xor operation is can be perform on two strings of bits in the same manner
one zero zero one zero one one zero or one zero zero zero one one zero zero, results
one zero zero zero zero one zero zero
and one zero zero one zero one one zero xor one zero zero zero one one zero zero, results
zero zero zero one one zero one zero
an important use of the and operation is for placing zero’s in one part of bit pattern
this module describes the arithmetic and the logic instructions, in this module a brief
without disturbing the other part
for example, if the byte one one one one zero zero zero zero is the first operand of an
and operation, without considering the content of the second operand
we can conclude that the foremost significant bits of the result will be a copy of the part
of the second operand, and the four least significant bits of the result will be zeros
that is one one one one zero zero zero zero and zero one zero one zero one zero one gives
zero one zero one zero zero zero zero
this use of the and operation is an example for masking, here one operand called the mask
determines which part of the other operand will affect the result
masking produces a partial replica of one of the operands, with non duplicated positions
description on the communication of computer with peripheral devices is also given
occupying zeros
masking is useful when manipulating a bit map, bit-map is a string of bits, in which
each bit represents the presence or absence of a particular object, bit maps are mainly
used for representing images
the bit maps used in a memory cell are used to find out whether the object is associated
with the particular bit from the high order end
for example, the fourth bit is present, it just need to and in their bytes with the mask
zero zero zero one zero zero zero zero, which produces a byte of all zeros
if and only if the fourth bit from the high order end of the bit map is itself zero
if the second bit from the high order end of the bitmap is a one, and we want to change
arithmetic and logic instruction- this instruction consists of arithmetic, logic and shift operations
it to a zero without disturbing the other bits
we can and the bitmap with the mask one zero one one one one one one and then store the result
as the and operation can be used to duplicate a part of a bit string, by placing zeros in
the non duplicated part
the or operation can be used it to duplicate a part of a string, while putting ones in
a non duplicated part
for this the mask will have zeros for those bits to be duplicated and ones for non duplicated positions
for example, oring one one one one zero zero zero zero produces ones in its most significant
for bits, while the remaining bits have a copy of the list significant for bits of the
other operand
arithmetic operation can be apply on numerical values to add, subtract, multiply or divide
that is one one one one zero zero zero zero or one zero one zero one zero one zero results
one one one one one zero one zero
xor operation is used in forming the complement of a bit string, xoring in a byte with a mask
of all ones produces the complement of the byte
example, one one one one one one one one xor one zero one zero one zero one one, produces
zero one zero one zero one zero zero
shift and rotate operations- these operations provide a means for moving bits within a register,
and are often used in solving alignment problems
these operations are classified by the direction of motion right or left and whether the process
is circular
the logic operations are basically the operations performed by logic gates, and the main operations
consider a register containing a byte of bits
if it is shifted by one bit to the right, the right most bit will fall off the edge
and a hole appears at the leftmost end
hence, the extra bit at the right end is placed in the hole at the left end, the
result is a circular shift or a rotation
in other technique is discard the bit that falls off the edge and always fill the hole
with the zero, this is refer to as logical shift
such shift to the left can be used for multiplying two’s complement representations by two
just as left shift of the decimal digits correspond to multiplication by ten, shifting binary
digits to the left corresponds to multiplication by two
are and, or, not and xor
﻿welcome to the session on communication and instruction format
the buses to manage the transfer directly between the io devices and the memory unit
bus- inside computers, there are many internal components in order for these components to
communicate with each other they make use of wires that are known as bus
a bus is a common pathway through which information flows from one computer component to
another this pathway is used for communication purpose and it is established between
two or more computer components functions of buses in computer data sharing- all types of
buses found in a computer transfer data between the computer peripherals connected to it
the buses transfer or send data in either serial or parallel method of data transfer
this allows for the exchange of one, two, four or even eight bytes of data at a time,
by this group of eight bits buses are classified depending
components io devices can be secondary memories, for example, disk and tapes, or devices used to
on how many bits they can move at the same time, which means that we have eight-bit,
sixteen-bit, thirty two-bit or even sixty four-bit buses addressing- a bus has address lines which
match those of the processor, this allows data to be sent to or from specific memory locations
power- a bus supplies power to various peripherals connecting to it
timing- a bus provides a system clock signal to synchronize the peripherals attached to it
with the rest of the system instruction format- an instruction
format defines the layout of the bits of an instruction, in terms of its constituent parts
an instruction format must include an opcode and implicitly or explicitly zero or more operands
each explicit operand is referenced using one of the addressing modes that are available for that
machine the format must implicitly or explicitly indicate the addressing mode of each operand
communicate directly with users such as video displays, keyboards and mouse the communication
foremost instruction sets more than one instruction format is used
the bits of an instruction are divided into groups called fields the most common fields found in
instruction formats are an operation code field that specifies the operation to be performed
an address field that designates a memory address or a processor register a mode
field that specifies the way the operand or the effective address is determined
other special fields are sometimes employed under certain circumstances the operation
code field of an instruction is a group of bits that define various processor operations, such as
add, subtract, complement and shift address fields contain either a memory address field
or a register address mode fields offer a variety of ways in which an operand is chosen
an instruction is of various lengths depending upon the number of addresses it contains
channels that tie the system together can either be simple links that connect two devices,
generally, cpu organization is of three types on the basis of number of address fields,
single accumulator organization, general register organization and stack organization
in the first organization operation involves a special register called accumulator
in second or multiple registers are used for the computation purpose in third organization
the work on stake basis operation due to which it does not contain any address field
it is not necessary that only a single organization is applied, a blend of various
organizations is mostly what we see generally instruction cycle- an instruction cycle also
known as fetch decode execute cycle is the basic operational process of a computer
this process is repeated continuously by the cpu from boot up to shut down of computer
the circuits used in the cpu during the cycles are program counter or pc it is an incrementing
or more complex switches that interconnect several components, and allow any two of them
counter that keeps track of the memory address of which instruction is to be executed next memory
address register or mar- the address in main memory that is currently being read or written
memory buffer register or mbr- a two-way register that holds data fetched from memory, and ready for
the cpu to process or data waiting to be stored in memory current instruction register or cir-
a temporary holding group for the instruction that has just been fetched from the memory
control unit or cu- decodes the program instruction in the cir,
selecting machine resources such as a data source register and a particular arithmetic operation,
and coordinates activation of these resources
arithmetic logic unit or alu- performs mathematical and logical operations
following are the steps that occur during an instruction cycle
to communicate at a given point in time when a switch is configured to allow
fetch the instruction- the instruction is fetched from memory address that is stored
in pc that is program counter, and stored in the instruction register ir at the end of the fetch
operation pc is incremented by one and it then points to the next instruction to be executed
second is decode the instruction, the instruction in the ir is executed by the decoder third,
read the effective address if the instruction has an indirect address, the effective address is read
from the memory otherwise operands are directly read in case of immediate operand instruction
fourth step is execute the instruction, the control unit passes the information
in the form of controls signals to the functional unit of cpu the result
generated is stored in main memory or sent to an output device the cycle is then repeated
by fetching the next instruction, thus in this way the instruction cycle is repeated continuously
two devices to exchange information, all other devices that relay on the switch are blocked
instruction set- an instruction set is a group of commands for a cpu in machine language the
term can refer to all possible instructions for a cpu or a subset of instruction to enhance
its performance in certain situations all cpu’s have instruction sets that enable
commands to the processor directing the cpu to switch the relevant transistors
some instructions are simple, read, write and move commands that direct data to different hardware
the instruction set provides commands to the processor, to tell it what it needs to do
the instruction set consists of addressing modes, instructions, native data types, registers,
memory architecture, interrupt and execution* handling and external io an example of an
instruction set is x eighty six instruction set, which is common to find on computers theory
different computer processors can use almost the same instruction set, while still having
that is they must wait until the switch can be reconfigured all units in the computer
very different internal design both the intel pentium and amd athlon processors use nearly the
same x eighty six instruction set the instruction set can be built into the hardware of the processor,
or it can be emulated in software using an interpreter the hardware design is more
efficient and faster for running programs than the emulated software wish examples
of instruction set are add – to add two numbers together compare - compare numbers in- input
information from a device, example- keyboard, jump - jump to designated ram address
jump if - conditional statement that jumps to a designated ram address
load - load information from ram to the cpu out - output information to the device,
example monitor store - store information to ram
in the early days of computing, the cost of computer memory was very high,
system work in conjunction with each other to formulate a functioning computer system, to have
and the amount of memory available tended to be limited by this factor limiting the size of a
program in memory was therefore an important consideration program size was influenced by
the number and the size of the instructions required to carry out a particular task
an instruction set with a high code density used powerful instructions that could perform
several functions at once there are two prevalent instruction set architectures
complex instruction set architecture, cisc- the cisc approach attempts to minimize the number of
instructions per program, sacrificing the number of cycles per instruction
the other is, reduced instruction set architecture, risc- risc does the opposite,
reducing the cycles per instruction at the cost of the number of instructions per program
cisc architecture- computers based on the cisc architecture are
a proper coordination between these units such as processor, memory and io devices a reliable
designed to decrease the memory cost because the large programs need more storage,
thus increasing the memory cost and large memory becomes more expensive
to solve these problems the number of instructions per program can be reduced by
embedding the number of operations in a single instruction, thereby, making the instructions
more complex example of cisc processors are ibm three seventy one sixty eight- it
was introduced in the year nineteen seventy cisc design is a thirty two-bit processor and
four sixty four-bit floating point registers vax eleven seven eighty- cisc design is a thirty
two-bit processor and it supports many numbers of addressing modes and machine instructions,
which is from digital equipment corporation intel eight zero four eight six- it was launched
in the year nineteen eighty nine and it is a cisc processor, which has instructions varying
and robust means of communication is required processor to memory communication- the whole
the main components in a typical computer system are the processor,
lengths from one to eleven and it will have a two thirty five instructions risc architecture-
reduced instruction set computer is a type of microprocessor architecture that utilizes a small
highly optimized a set of instructions rather than a more specialized a set of instructions
often found in other types of architectures it is a dramatic departure from historical
architectures most risc architectures have fixed length instructions commonly thirty two bits,
and a simple encoding which simplifies fetch, decode and issue logic considerably risc designs
have a model, where the instruction stream and the data stream are conceptually separated this means
that modifying the memory where code is held might not have any effect on the instructions executed
by the processor because the cpu has a separate instruction and data cache, at least until a
special synchronization instruction is issued on the other hand this allows both caches to be
process of communication between the processor and the memory can be divided into two steps
assessed simultaneously, which can often improve performance
examples of risc processors the arm architecture- dominates the market for low power and low cost
embedded systems it is used in a number of systems such as most android-based systems,
the apple iphone and ipad, microsoft windows phone, etcetera ibm’s power architecture- it
is found in the gamecube, playstation three, xbox three sixty and other gaming consoles
the mips line- used now in the playstation, playstation two, and residential gateways like
linksys wrt fifty four g series now, let us summarize the session
the most important and expensive component of a computer is the processor
all the other characteristics of computer depend on the maximum utilization of the processor
the processor should get the data and instruction as and when required, the
namely, information transfer from the memory to the processor and writing information in
communication and instruction formats play a key role in this hence, in this session we have seen
the communication between processor and memory, that between processor and devices etcetera
the different types of instruction formats and the two important architectures, such as cisc and
risc are also mentioned here hope you enjoyed the session, see you next time, until then bye
the memory communication between memory and processing unit consists of two registers,
memory address register, mar and memory data register, mdr the sequence of events takes place
when information is transferred from memory to the processor are, the processor places the addresses
in mar through the address bus the processor issues a read command through the control bus
the memory places retrieved data on the data bus, which is then transferred to the processor
based on the read time of the memory, a specific number of processor clock in the wells are
allotted for the completion of this process during this interval the processor is forced to
wait, similarly, the following sequence of events takes place, when information is written into the
memory, input output devices and the communication channels that connect them
memory the processor places the addresses in mar through the address bus the processor transmits
the data to be written in memory using the data bus the processor issues a write command to the
memory by the control bus the data is written in memory at address specified in mar
the main concern in processor memory communication is the speed mismatch between
memory and the processor memory access time is generally slower than the cpu’s access time,
hence, it is forced to wait for the data this speed mismatch is eliminated by using a small
fast memory, as an intermediate buffer between processor and the memory called the cache
cache memory- cache memory provides faster data storage
and access by storing instances of programs, and the data routinely accessed by the processor
thus, when a processor requests data that already has an instance in the cache memory,
the processor is the work host of the system it is the component that executes a program
it does not need to go to the main memory or the hard disk to fetch the data cache memory can be
primary or secondary cache memory, with primary cache memory directly integrated into or closest
to the processor in addition to hardware based cache, cache memory also can be a disk cache,
where a reserved portion on a disk stores and provides access to frequently access data or
applications from the disk format of the cache hierarchy- cache memory is fast and expensive,
traditionally it is categorized as levels that describe its closeness
and accessibility to the microprocessor l one cache- l one cache or primary cache
is extremely fast, but relatively small and is usually embedded in the processor chip
as cpu cache l two cache- l two cache or secondary cache is often more capacities than
l one l two cache maybe embedded on the cpu, or it can be on separate chip or co-processor,
by performing arithmetic and logical operations on data it is the only component that creates
and have a high speed alternative system bus connecting the cache and cpu that way it does
not get slowed by traffic on the main system bus level three or l three cache- level three cache
is specialized memory developed to improve the performance of l one and l two, l one or l two can
be significantly faster than l three though l three is usually double the speed of ram
with multi-core processor, each core can have dedicated l one and l two cache,
but they can share an l three cache if an l three cache references an instruction, it is
usually elevated to a higher level of cache cache memory mapping- caching configurations continue to
evolve but, cache memory traditionally works under three different configurations, such as
direct mapped cache, fully associative cache and set associative cache direct mapped cache-
direct mapped cache has each block mapped to exactly one cache memory location
new information by combining or modifying current information memory is a passive
conceptually, direct mapped cache is like rows in a table with three columns
the data block or cache line that contains the actual data fetched and stored are tagged with
all or part of the address of the data that was fetched, and a flag bit that shows the presence
in the row entry of a valid bit of data fully associative cache- fully associative cache mapping
is similar to direct mapping in structure but, allows a block to be mapped to any cache location
rather than to a pre-specified cache memory location, as is the case with direct mapping
set associative cache- set associative cache mapping can be viewed as a compromise between
direct mapping and fully associative mapping in which each block is mapped to a subset
of cache locations it is sometimes called n-way set associative mapping,
which provides for a location in main memory to be cache to any of n locations in the l one cache
component that simply stores information until it is requested by another part of the system
processor to io devices communication- the method that is used to transfer information
between internal storage and external io devices is also known as io interface
the cpu is interfaced using special communication links by the peripherals connected to any computer
system these communication links are used to resolve the differences between cpu
and peripheral there exists special hardware components between cpu and peripherals to
supervise and synchronize all the input and output transfers that are called interface units
the binary information that is received from an external device is
usually stored in the memory unit the information that is transferred
from the cpu to the external device is originated from the memory unit
cpu merely processes the information but the source and target is always the memory unit
during normal operations it feeds instructions and data to the processor, and at other times
data transfer between cpu and the io devices maybe done in different modes data transfer
to and from the peripherals maybe done in any of the three possible ways programmed io, interrupt
initiated io and direct memory access or dma programmed io- it is due to the result of the io
instructions, better returned in the computer program each data item transfer is initially
by an instruction in the program, usually the transfer is from a cpu register and memory
in this case it requires constant monitoring by the cpu of the peripheral devices
interrupt initiated io- since in the above case we saw the cpu is kept busy unnecessarily,
this situation can very well be avoided by using an interrupt driven method for data transfer
by using interrupt facility and special commands to inform the interface to issue an interrupt
request signal, whenever data is available from any device in the mean time the cpu can proceed
it is the source or destination of data transferred by io devices input output devices
for any other program execution, the interface meanwhile keeps monitoring the device
whenever it is determined that the device is ready for data transfer, it initiates
an interrupt request signal to the computer upon detection of an external interrupt signal,
the cpu stops momentarily the task, that it was already performing, branches to the service,
program to the process the io transfer and then return to the task it was originally performing
direct memory access- the data transfer between a fast storage media, such as magnetic disk and
memory unit is limited by the speed of the cpu thus, we can allow the peripherals directly
communicate with each other using the memory buses, removing the intervention of the cpu
this type of data transfer technique is known as dma or direct memory access during dma the
cpu is ideal and it has no control over the memory buses the dma controller takes over
transfer information without altering it between the external world, and one or more internal
welcome
but, with a tablet one can easily point to a region with the stylus using the kinesthetic
sense, informally known as "muscle memory "
transfer function- it device in combination with the host operating system typically modifies
its signals using a mathematical transformation
that scales the data to provide smooth efficient and intuitive operation
an appropriate mapping is a transfer function that matches the physical properties sensed
by the input device
appropriate mappings include force to velocity, position to position and velocity to velocity functions
for example, an isometric joystick senses force, a nonlinear rate mapping transfers
this into a velocity of cursor movement, ideally the device should also be self centric
input and output devices- an input device sends information to a computer system for
when using a rate mapping with spring returned to the zero input value, so that the user
can stop quickly by releasing the device
a common inappropriate mapping is calculating the speed of scrolling based on the position
of the mouse cursor, such as extending a selected region by dragging the mouse close to the
edge of the screen
the user has no feedback off when to or what extent scrolling will accelerate, and the
resulting interaction can be hard to learn, how to use and difficult to control
a symbol multiplicative transfer function is known as the device gain, which can also
be described as a control to display that is cd ratio
the ratio between the moment of the input device and the corresponding moment of the
processing, and an output device reproduces or displays the results of that processing
object it controls
number of dimension- devices can measure one or more linear and angular dimensions
for example, a mouse measures two linear dimensions, and knob measures one angular dimension
and a six degree of freedom, six d of magnetic trackers measure three linear dimensions and
three angular dimension
if the number of dimensions required by the users interaction task does not match the
number of dimensions provided by the input device, special handling mechanisms are to
be introduced
this may include extra buttons graphically gets more switching etcetera
pointing speed and accuracy- the standard way to characterize pointing device performance
computer input is called data and the output obtained after processing it, based on user's
employs the fit slow paradigm
fit slow relates the moment time to a point at a target, the amplitude of the moment there
is a distance to the target and the width of the target, that is the precision requirement
of the pointing moment
the moment time is proportional to the logarithm of the distance divided by the target width,
with constant terms that vary from one device to another
input device states- to select a single point or region with an input device users need
a way to signal, when they are selecting something versus when they are just moving over something
to reach a desired target
the need for this fundamental signal of intention is often forgotten by researchers eager to
instructions is called information
explore new interaction modalities, such as the empty handed pointing, example, using
camera tracking or non contacting proximity sensing of hand position
the three state model of input generalizes the state censored by input devices as tracking,
which causes the cursor to move drag, which allows selection of objects by clicking as
well as moving objects by clicking and dragging them
and out of range which occurs when the device moves out of its physical tracking range
example, mouse is lifted from the dust or the stylus is removed from a tablet, most
pointing device sense only two of these three states
for example, a mouse senses tracking and dragging, but a touchpad senses tracking and the out
of range state
raw facts and figures which can be processed using arithmetic and logical operations to
hence, to fully simulate the functionality offered by mice, touchpad’s needs special
procedures such as tapping to click which are browned to in advance activation
example, touching the pad by accident causes a click
direct versus indirect control- a mouse is an indirect input device, one must move the
mouse to point to a spot on the screen
it touch screens a direct input device, that is the display surface also the input surface
direct devices raise several unique issues
designers must consider the possibility of parallax error resulting from a gap between
the input and display surfaces, reduced transmissivity of the screen introduced by a sensing layer,
or occlusion of the display by the user's hands
obtain information are called data
another issue is that it’s screen can support a cursor tracking state or a dragging state,
but not both
typically touchscreens move directly from the out of way range stayed to the dragging
state, when the user touches the screen with no intermediate cursor feedback
device acquisition time- the average time to pick up or put down an input device is
known as acquisition time or sometimes homing time
it is often assumed to be a significant factor for user performance, however, one exemption
is stylus or pen based input devices
pens are generally comparable to mice in general pointing performance
modeling of repetitive tasks- the keystroke level model klm is commonly used to model
some input devices are graphics tablets, cameras, video capture hardware, trackballs, barcode readers, digital camera, gamepad,
expert user performance in repetitive tasks, such as text editing
the klm includes standard operators that represent average times required for pointing with an
input device
pressing a button, posses for a decision making and device acquisition time, but the model
does not account for errors or not expert behavior, such as problem solving
hardware criteria- various other characteristics can distinguish input devices, but are perhaps
less important in distinguishing the fundamental types of interaction techniques that can be supported
engineering parameters of a device's performance such as sampling rate, resolution, accuracy,
and linearity can all influence performance
latency is the end-to-end delay between the user’s physical moment sensing this and
joystick, keyboard, microphone,midi keyboard, mouse, scanner, webcam,
providing the ultimate system feedback to the user
latency can be a devious problem as it is impossible to completely eliminate from system
performance, latency of more than seventy to hundred milliseconds significantly impairs
user performance for many interactive tasks
device modes of io data transfer- data transfer between the central unit and io devices can
be handled in generally three types of modes, which are given below
programmed io, interrupt initiated io and direct memory access
programmed io instructions- programmed io instructions are the result of io instructions
written in computer program
each data item transfer is initiated by the instruction in the program
touchpad’s, pen inputs, microphone, electronic whiteboard,
usually the program controls data transfer to and from cpu and peripheral
transferring the data under programmed io requires constant monitoring of the peripherals
by the cpu
interrupt initiated io- in the programmed io method, the cpu stays in the program loop
until the io unit indicates that it is ready for data transfer
this is a time consuming process because it keeps the processor busy needlessly
this problem can be overcome by using interrupt initiated io
in this when the interface determines that the peripheral is ready for data transfer,
it generates an interrupt
after receiving the interrupt signal, the cpu stops the task, which is processing and
omr, ocr, punch card reader, micr and magnetic tape drive
service the io transfer and returns back to its previous processing tasks
direct memory access- removing an cpu from the path and letting the peripheral device
manage the memory, buses directly would improve the speed of transfer
this technique is known as dma
in this the interface transferred data to and from the memory, through memory bus
a dma controller manages to transfer data between peripherals and memory unit
many hardware systems use dma such as disk drives controllers, graphic cards, network
cards and sound cards etcetera
it is also used for intra chip data transfer in multi-core processors
in dma, cpu would initiate the transfer do other operations, by the transfer is in progress
output the results produced by the central processing unit, is a computer’s whole reason
and receive an interrupt from the dma controller, when the transfer has been completed
user interface transactions- early efforts in human computer interaction sought to identify
elemental task, that appear repeatedly in human computer dialogues
user interface transactions are composed of the following elemental task
selection- choosing objects from a set of alternatives
position- specify a position within a range, this includes picking a screen coordinate
with a pointing device
orient- specifying an angle or three-dimensional orientation
path- specifying a series of positions and or orientations over time
quantify- specifying an exact numeric value
for being
text- entry of symbolic data
io module- io module is intermediate between io devices and cpu
system buses are connected to the one end of io module, and other end is connected to
the number of io devices
it is used to exchange information between io devices and cpu
io devices cannot be directly connected to the system buses, they are connected to the
system buses through module
there are several reasons for not connecting io devices, directly to the system buses and
they are as follows
variety of io devices are available with different operation method
output is usable information that is raw input data that has been processed by the computer
it was not possible to develop operation logic of each io devices in the cpu list
the io devices are much slower than the cpu
hence it is not possible to match the high speed of cpu with the speed of io devices
as io devices are made with different operation methods, some of them uses different data formats
it was impractical to integrate each data format in the cpu
thus, io module is used to match speed, operation method and data format between cpu and io devices
functions of io module- the major functions of modules are categorized as follows
control and timing- in some of the io operation few resources share such as cpu and memory,
because cpu communicates with more than one device at a time
control and timing function synchronizes data flow between io devices and internal resources,
into information
such as memory and cpu
processor communication- io module communicates with the cpu and io devices, it performs following steps
status inquiry of io device from io module, io module accepts data from io device and
transfers it to the cpu
device communication- in addition, io module communicates with io devices
feature of io module, data buffering- as io devices are much slower than cpu and memory
in order to maintain speed of data flow between io devices and internal resources, io module
buffers data
device can access buffered data any time without holding system bus
error detection- it is built-in feature of io module that detects electrical and mechanical errors
the most common forms of outputs are words, numbers and graphics
io drivers and controllers- all peripherals require driver software, which enables the
os to command the hardware
when a peripheral device is added that is new to the computer, a controller card is
plugged in and a driver is installed
every peripheral device such as keyboard, modem, monitor etcetera requires a control
unit that interfaces with the computer’s processor that is the cpu
these circuits are either built into the chips on the motherboard or are contained on plug-in cards
the input or output controller is a device that interfaces between an input or output
device and the hardware device
the input output controller on a computer is commonly located on the motherboard
word output for example may be the letters and memos prepared by office people using
however, an io controller can also be an internal add-on that can either be used as replacement
or allow for addition input or output devices for the computer
the device controller works like an interface between a device and a device driver
io units such as keyboard, mouse, printer etcetera, typically consists of a mechanical
component and an electric component, where electric component is called the device controller
there is always a device controller and the device driver for each device to communicate
with the operating system
a device controller maybe able to handle multiple devices, as an interface it’s main task
is to convert serial mid-stream to block of bytes, perform error correction as necessary
now, let us summarize the session
word processing software
input output deice is any hardware used by a human operator or other systems to communicate
with a computer
as the name indicates input output devices are capable of sending data or output to a
computer, and receiving data from a computer input
the way system manages different types of inputs and outputs depend on the io system
here an overview of the io devices and the system is given to get an idea about the different
types of input devices
the connection ports used to connect different peripherals, the mode of data transmission etcetera
the session ends with an introduction to io drivers and io monitors
hope you enjoyed this session, see you next time, bye
other workers may be more interested in numbers such as those found in formulas, schedules and budgets
in many cases numbers can be understood more easily, when output in the form of charts
and graphics
a computer is an electronic machine that accepts data from the user, processes the data by
some output devices are monitors, printers, plotters, projectors, lcd projection panels,
computer output microfilm, speakers, head phones, visual display unit, film recorder
and microfiche
connection ports- port is a connecting socket outside the system, into which different types
of cables are plugged
it is a specific place from which other devices can be physically connected
io ports are the interfaces through which computers communicate with external devices,
such as printers, modems, joysticks and terminals
there are many types of ports used in computer system, some of them are given as follows
parallel port- various peripherals can be connected through parallel port, which is
performing calculations and operations on it, and generates the desired output results
a parallel communication physical interface
a parallel port transmits eight bits of a byte of data in parallel, it is used for transmitting
fast data over short distances
it is used to connect a printer to a computer, since a parallel port transmits an end a byte
at a time, it operates io devices at a relatively high speed
a parallel port is primarily used to connect printers to a computer and hence it is often
called a printer port
serial port- serial port transmits one bit of a byte, one at a time single streams of bits
it is meant for transmitting slower data over long distances, communication over a phone
is an example of serial communication
a computer system consists of both hardware and information stored on hardware
it is a serial communication physical interface which transmits one bit at a time, dial-up
modems and serial mice use serial ports
universal serial bus or usb- a usb port can connect up to one twenty seven peripheral
devices such as a digital camera, digital speakers, scanners, speaker’s etcetera
it permits plug and play which means that configuration of expansion cards and peripheral
devices as and when they are installed
small computer system interface or scsi port- scsi that is small computer system interface
port allows data to be transmitted in a daisy chain up to seven devices at a speed higher
thirty two bits at a time, than those possible with serial and parallel ports
it is a fast data transmitting device and is used to connect hdd, cd-rom drivers and
information stored on computer hardware is often called software
scanners with the computer system
io device types- an io system is required to take an input request from some application
and send it to the physical device
then take whatever response comes back from the device and send it to the application
io device can be divided into two categories
block devices- a block device is one with which the driver software communicates by
sending n their blocks of data
for example, hard-disk, usb cameras, disk on key etcetera
character devices- a character device is one with which the driver communicates by sending
and receiving single characters by its optics etcetera
the hardware components of a computer system are the electronic and mechanical parts
for example, serial ports, parallel ports, sound cards etcetera
external devices- io operations are accomplished through external devices that provide a means
of exchanging data between external environment and computer
an external device attaches to the computer by a link to an io module, an external device
link to an io module is called peripheral device or peripheral
external device can be categorized as human readable and machine readable, human readable
means suitable for communicating with computer user
for example, video display terminals and printers, machine readable are suitable for communicating
with equipment
for example, sensor, actuators used in robotics applications
the software components of a computer system are the data and the computer programs
communication suitable for communicating with remote devices, they maybe human readable
device, such as terminal and machine readable device, such as in other computer
properties of devices- the number and types of input devices and output devices available
in the market today can be completely confusing
fortunately, there are number of organizing properties and principles, which can help
to make sense of the design space and performance issues
physical property sensed- traditional pointing devices typically sense position, motion,
or force
a tablet senses position, a mouse measures motion that is change in position, and an
isometric joystick senses force
the major hardware components of a computer system are processor, main memory, secondary
an isometric joystick is a self-centering force sensing joystick such as the ibm trackpoint
"eraser-head" found on many laptops
for a rotary device the corresponding properties are angles, change in angle and torque
position sensing devices are also known as absolute input devices, whereas motion sensing
devices are relative input device
an absolute device can fully support relative motion, since it can calculate changes to
position, but, a relative device cannot fully support absolute positioning
and in fact can only emulate position at all by introducing a cursor on the screen
note that it is difficult to move the mouse cursor to a particular area of the screen
other than the edges without looking at the screen
memory, input devices and output devices
welcome
like the new curved displays that are being released
touch screen monitors- touch screen monitors are used for input as well as output
a touch screen is a special type of visual display until it has a grid of light beams
of fine wires on the screen
it lets the user to interact with a computer by the touch of a finger rather than typing
on a keyboard or moving a mouse
the user can enter data by touching icons or menus identified on the screen
most touch screen computers use sensors to detect touch of a finger
touch screen is well suited for simple applications like atm
it has also become common in department stores and supermarkets
plotters, etcetera
types of touch screen monitors - there are different types of touch screen technology
the most common types are resistive, surface wave and capacitive
resistive touch screen- this monitor usually has a chord of thin electrically conductive
and resistive layer of metal
a change in electrical current occurs when it is pressed
the input can be processed by a computer
these monitors are the most popular types of touchscreen monitors used today
they are usually not affected by dust or liquids, which make them very reliable
surface wave touch screen- these monitors use ultrasonic waves to process input from the screen
these waves flow over the touch screen, the wave is absorbed and processed by computer
monitors- monitors, commonly called as visual display unit, or vdu are the main output device
when a person touches the pad
capacitive touch screen- these screens are coated with indium tin oxide
this material provides continuous current across the screen
the current can be measured by the processor when the pad is touched
it is usually used with a bad finger instead of stylus
these screens have high clarity and are not affected by dust
nowadays, most of the smartphones have capacitive touch screens
printer- a computer printer is a device or an instrument that must be connected to a
computer, which allows users to print text and graphics on the plain papers
in some cases, they can be directly connected to digital camera for printing pictures without
of a computer
connecting to any computer
computer printer is one of the essential hardware whether it is for a large company or for personal use
the usage of printer is depend upon the requirement of the company or individual person
printers can be divided into two main categories- impact printers and non-impact printers
impact printers- an impact printer makes contact with the paper
it usually forms the print image by pressing an inked ribbon against the paper using a
hammer or pins
following are some of examples of impact printers
dot- matrix printers- the dot matrix printer uses print heads containing from nine to twenty-four pins
these pins produce patterns of dots on the paper to form the individual characters
it forms images from tiny dots called pixels that are arranged in a rectangular form
the twenty-four-pin dot matrix printer produces more dots than a nine-pin dot matrix printer
which results in much better quality and clearer characters
the general rule is the more pins the clearer the letters on the paper
the pins strike the ribbon individually, as the print mechanism moves across the entire
print line in both directions
that is from left to right, then right to left and so on
the user can produce a colour output with a dot matrix printer
the user will change the black ribbon with a ribbon that has colour stripes
dot- matrix printers are inexpensive and typically print at speeds of hundred to six hundred
characters per second
the sharpness of the image depends upon the number of pixels
daisy- wheel printers- the heart of the system is an interchangeable metal or plastic daisy-wheel
holding an entire character set as raised characters moulded on each petal
in order to get the quality of type found in typewriters a daisy- wheel impact printer
can be used
it is called daisy-wheel printer because the print mechanism looks like a daisy as at the
end of each petal is a fully formed character which produces solid line print
a hammer strikes a petal containing a character against the ribbon and the character prints
on the paper
the speed of the printer is typically low with twenty-five to fifty-five characters per second
line printers- in business, where enormous amount of materials are printed, the character
the size of the monitor we use truly depends on our preference
at a time printers are too slow
therefore, these users need line at a time printers
line printers or line at a time printers use special mechanisms that can print a whole
line at once
they can typically print the range of thousand two hundred to six thousand lines per minute
drum, chain and band printers are line at a time printers
drum printer- a drum printer consists of a solid cylindrical drum that has raised characters
in bands on its surface
the number of print positions across the drum equals the number available on the page
this number typically ranges from eighty to one thirty-two print positions
things to consider are our eyesight, who else will be using it and the distance the monitor
the drum rotates at a rapid speed
for each possible print position, there is a print hammer located behind the paper
these hammers strike the paper along the ink ribbon against the proper character on the
drum as it passes
one revolution of the drum is required to print each line
this means that all characters on the line are not printed at exactly the same time,
but the time required to print the entire line is fast enough to call them as line printers
typically, speeds of drum printers are in the range of three hundred to two thousand
lines per minute
chain printers- a chain printer uses a chain of print characters wrapped around to pulleys
will be sitting away from us
like the drum printer, there is one hammer for each print position
circuitry inside the printer detects when the correct character appears at the desired
print location on the page
the hammer then strikes the page pressing the paper against a ribbon and the character
located at the desired print position
an impression of the character is left on the page
the chain keeps rotating until all the required print positions on the line have filled
then the page moves up to print the next line
speed of the chain printers range from four hundred to two thousand five hundred characters
per minute
there are monitors sizes ranging from seven inches as a supplementary peripheral, but
non-impact printers- non- impact printers do not use a striking device to produce characters
on the paper
and because these printers do not hammer against the paper, they are much quieter
following are some non-impact printers
ink-jet printers- ink-jet printers work in the same fashion as dot- matrix printers in
the form of images or characters with little dots
however, the dots are formed by tiny droplets of ink
ink-jet printers form characters on paper by spraying ink from tiny nozzles through
an electrical field that arranges the charged ink particles into characters at the rate
of approximately two fifty characters per second
normal monitors range from a seventeen-inch diagonal to a monster fifty-five-inch diagonal
to the session on output devices
the ink is absorbed into the paper and dries instantly
various colours of ink can also be used
one or more nozzles in the printhead emits a steady stream of ink drops
droplets of ink are electrically charged after leaving the nozzle
the droplets are then guided to the paper by electrically charged deflecting plates
one plate has positive charge upper plate, and the other has negative charge which is
the lower plate
a nozzle for black ink may be all that's needed to print text
but full colour printing is also possible with the addition three extra nozzles for
cyan, magenta and yellow primary colours
monochrome monitor- a monochrome monitor is a type of crt computer display, which was
if a droplet isn't needed for the character or image being formed, it is recycled back
to its input nozzle
several manufacturers produce colour inkjet printers
some of these printers come with all the colour inks in the cartridge
if you want to replace one colour, you must replace all the colours
other colour inkjet printers allow you to replace ink individually
these printers are a better choice, if user uses one colour more than other colours
these printers produce less noise and print in better quality with greater speed
laser printers- a laser printer works like a photocopy machine
laser printers produce images on paper by directing a laser beam at a mirror which bounces
very common in the early days of computing from the nineteen sixties through the nineteen
the beam into a drum
the drum has a special coating on it to which toner, which is an ink powder sticks
using patterns of small dots, a laser beam conveys information from the computer to a
positively charged drum to become neutralized
from all these areas of drum, which become neutralized, the toner detaches
as the paper rolls by the drum the toner is transferred to the paper printing the letter
or other graphics on the paper
a hot roller bonds the toner to the paper
laser printers use buffers that store an entire page at a time
when a whole page is loaded, it will be printed
eighties, before colour monitors became popular
the speed of laser printers is high and they print quietly without producing much noise
many home-use laser printers can print eight pages per minute
but faster and print approximately twenty-one thousand lines per minute, or four thirty-seven
pages per minute, if each page contains forty-eight lines
when high speed laser printers were introduced, they were expensive
developments in the last few years have provided relatively low-cost laser printers for use
in small businesses
plotter- a plotter is a printer designed for printing vector graphics
instead of printing individual dots on the paper, plotters draw continuous lines
this makes plotters ideal for printing architectural blueprints, engineering designs and other
they are still widely used in applications such as computerized cash register systems
cad drawings
there are two main types of plotters, drum and flatbed plotters
drum plotters, also called roller plotters, spin the paper back and forth on a cylindrical
drum while the ink pens move left and right
by combining these two directions, lines can be drawn in any direction
flatbed plotters have a large horizontal surface on which the paper is placed
a traveling bar draws lines on the paper as it moves across the surface
most drum and flatbed plotters provide output sizes that are much larger than standard inkjet
and laser printers
for example, a typical ink-jet printer creates documents that are eight point five inches wide
monochrome monitors actually display two colours, one for the background and one for the foreground
a drum plotter may produce documents that are forty-four inches wide
the length of a document printed by a drum plotter is only limited by the size of the paper
documents printed by flatbed plotters are constrained to the length and width of the
printing surface
hope you enjoyed this session
see you next time
bye
the colours can be black and white, green and black or amber and black
colour monitor- colour monitors can display anywhere from sixteen to over one million
different colours
colour monitors are sometimes called rgb monitors, because they accept three separate signals
red, green and blue
an output device is any peripheral that receives data from a computer, usually for display,
features of monitors - size- monitors are available in different sizes
the standard monitor for personal computers is thirteen to sixteen inches
the size of the monitor is measured diagonally
resolution- resolution of a monitor is the number of pixels on the screen
it is the image sharpness of a display screen
it is expressed as a matrix
a resolution of six forty by four eighty means there is six forty horizontal pixels and four
eighty vertical pixels
the actual resolution is determined by the video controller, not by monitor
most monitors provide the resolutions of six forty by four eighty, eight hundred by six
projection or physical reproduction
hundred, and thousand twenty-four by seven sixty-eight
refresh rate- the number of times the electron guns scan every pixel on the screen in one
second is called refresh rate
it is measured in hertz or cycles per second
dot pitch- the distance between the phosphorus dots that create a single pixel is called
a dot pitch
types of monitors- there are two kinds of viewing screen used for monitors, cathode
ray tube, crt and flat panel display
cathode ray tube or crt monitor- the crt display is made up of small picture elements called pixels
the smaller the pixels, the better the image clarity or resolution
for example, an ink-jet printer is an output device that can make a hard copy of any information
it takes more than one illuminated pixel to form a whole character such as the letter
e in the word 'help'
a finite number of characters can be displayed on a screen at once
the screen can be divided into a series of character boxes fixed the location on the
screen, where a standard character can be placed
most screens are capable of displaying eighty characters of data horizontally and twenty-five
lines vertically
while crt monitors can still be found in some organizations, many offices have stopped using
them largely because, they are heavy, bulky and costly to replace, should they break
while they are still in use, it would be a good idea to face these monitors out for cheaper,
shown on your monitor, which is another example of an output device
lighter and more reliable monitors
flat panel display monitor- the flat panel display refers to a class of video devices
that have reduced volume, weight and power requirement in comparison to the crt
you can hang them on walls or wear them on your wrist
current uses of flat-panel displays include calculators, video games, monitors, laptop
computers, and graphic displays
the flat-panel display is divided into two categories
emissive displays- emissive displays are devices that convert electrical energy into light
for example, plasma panel and led that is light emitting diodes
non-emissive displays- non emissive displays use optical effects to convert sunlight or
a computer can still work without an output device
light from some other sources into graphics patterns
for example, lcd, liquid crystal devices
lcd monitors- the lcd monitor or liquid crystal monitor incorporates one of the most advanced
technologies available today
typically, it consists of a layer of colour or monochrome pixels arranged schematically
between a couple of transparent electrodes and two polarizing filters
optical effect is made possible by polarizing the light in varied amounts and making it
pass through the liquid crystal layer
the two types of lcd technology available are the active matrix of tft and the passive matrix
technology
however, without an output device, no way of determining what the computer is doing,
tft generates better picture quality and is more secure and reliable
passive matrix on the other hand has slower response time and it is slowly becoming outdated
the advantages of lcd monitors include their compact size, which makes them lightweight
they also don't consume much electricity as crt monitors, and can be run off of batteries,
which makes them ideal for laptops
images transmitted by these monitors don't get geometrically distorted and have little thicker
however, this type of monitor does have disadvantages such as its relatively high price, and image
quality, which is not constant when viewed from different angles, and the monitor resolution
that is not always constant, meaning any alterations can result in reduced performance
led or light emitting diode monitors- led monitors are the latest type of monitors on
if there are errors, or if it needs additional input
the market today
these are flat panel or slightly curved displays, which make use of light emitting diodes for
backlighting instead of cold cathode fluorescent ccfl backlighting used in lcds
led monitors are set to use much lesser power than crt and lcd and are considered far more
environmentally friendly
the advantages of led monitors are that they produce images with the higher contrast, have
less negative environmental impact when disposed, are more durable than crt or lcd monitors
and features a very thin design
they also don't produce much heat while running
the only downside is that they can be more expensive, especially for the high-end monitors
following are some of the important output devices used in a computer- monitors, printers,
welcome back
another feature present in this generation was time sharing technique, a variant of multi
programming technique in which each user has an online that is directly connected terminal
because the user is present and interacting with one computer, the computer system must
respond quickly to user requests, otherwise, the throughput could be low
time sharing systems were developed to multi program large number of simultaneous interactive uses
fourth generation- with the development of large-scale integration circuits, operating
system became a user-friendly software
multi-processor technology evolved to the point that, it become possible to build desktop
computers as powerful as the mainframes of the nineteen seventies
two operating systems have dominated the personal computers such as ms dos, written by microsoft,
it also acts as a resource manager, which takes care of the various resources such as
and for the ibm pc and other machines using the intel eight-zero-eight- eight cpu and
its successors, and unix, which is dominant on the large personal computers using the
motorola six-eight-nine-nine cpu family
as the successor to ms dos, microsoft produced a gui based system called windows
from nineteen eighty-five to nineteen ninety-five, windows was just a graphical environment on
top of ms dos
but windows ninety-five was released as a free-standing version of windows that incorporated
many operating system features into one
there were several modifications for this version such as windows ninety-eight, windows
nt for new technology and windows me for millennium edition
process, memory, device information, etcetera
linux is becoming another popular operating system now
another development was the network operating system and the distributed operating system
in a network operating system, the users are aware of the existence of multiple computers
and the users can log in to remote machines as and when needed
but a distributed operating system appears to its users as a unique processor system,
but actually consists of multiple processors
operating system architecture- a typical computer system consists of different types of software
there are different schemes for classifying the types of software used for a computer system
one such division is based on the task which they are performing
there are different components which constitute an operating system, each performing a well-defined
there are different examples for operating systems
task for the overall performance of the operating system
here, we will have a discussion on these topics
types of softwares- a machine software is broadly divided into two categories such as
application software and system
software application software consists of the programs for particular tasks such as database systems,
desktop publishing systems, accounting systems, program development, software, and games
system software is used to perform the tasks which are common to computer systems
it supports the application software by providing the infrastructure required for application
software to do their jobs
system software is of two types
some of them are windows, unix, linux, and macos
one is operating system, and the other is a collection of software called a utility software
utility software consists of software units that extend the capabilities of the operating system
by implementing certain activities, utility software allows system software to be customized
to the needs of a particular installation more easily than if they were included in
the operating system
the software classification is given in the figure
components of the operating system- the operating system provides the environment for the users
to communicate with the machine and it controls the various resources associated with the
computer system
most operating systems are made up of a number of functionally separate pieces that together
history and evolution of operating systems- history of operating systems is very much
comprises the operating system
the view of an operating system is as follows
kernel- the internal part of an operating system is called the kernel
and operating systems kernel contains those software components that perform the very
basic functions required by the computer installation
the kernel is responsible for managing the other system programs
it can be thought of as upper management, which oversees the whole process of operating
the computer system
the process involves the integration of the hardware and software
file manager is one such unit whose job is to coordinate the use of the machine's mass
dependent upon the history of computers itself
storage facilities
shell- in order to perform the actions requested by the computer's users, an operating system
must be able to communicate with the users
the shell is an environment designed to allow a user to manipulate the system
the operating system handles the communication using the shell
it is the command interpreter between user and the system
modern shells perform this task by means of a graphical user interface or gui in which
objects to be manipulated are pictorially represented on the monitor as icons
these systems allow users to issue commands to the operating system by pointing to these
icons with the help of mouse or such pointing devices
the computers of the nineteen forties and nineteen fifties were not very flexible or
older shells communicate with users through textual messages using keyboard and monitor screen
some operating system allows a user to select among different shells to obtain most compatible
interface for that particular user
types of user interface - the part of the operating system that provides the way for
the human to communicate with the machine is called the human computer interface, hci
or more often the user interface ui
the operating system can be categorized according to its interface
uis generally fall into three types viz
command line, menu based and graphical
command line user interface- keyboard is used to communicate with the operating system and
much efficient
the computer
in the command line ui, the user types in commands and the computer responds to them
here the problem is that because computer must receive their instructions in very precise
ways, the user is required to type the commands in a very specific format called syntax
example unix and dos
menu based interface- menu based user interfaces are not common in operating systems
menus can simplify the use of a command line user interface, by providing a list of commands
from which to choose
the user selects the menu item by typing an identifier or by clicking with a mouse
then the menu-based ui types the complete and correct syntax for the user
machines occupied the entire rooms
graphical user interface- graphical user interface commonly referred to as gui, is really a very
sophisticated form of menu-based interface
instead of listing the command, it represents them as a number of small pictures called icons
for example, windows and macos
future user interfaces- one of the first changes will probably be the introduction of a voice
operated ui, which uses voice commands instead of typing or using click the commands
another is the adoption of three-dimensional look for user interface
structure of operating system- the structure of an operating system is a highly complex one
to reduce the complexity operating systems are usually referred and implemented in terms
of hierarchy of layers
program execution required significant preparation of equipments like, mounting magnetic tapes,
in this module, we are going to discuss about the operating system
this approach is an outgrowth of the concept of information hiding
externally a module is not to perform a specific function on objects of a given time
it is given in the figure layer one, kernel- typical mechanisms contained in the operating
systems are processor management mechanism, interrupt processing mechanism, memory management
mechanism, io mechanism, communication mechanism
layer two, basic input output- low level facilities for management of secondary storage needed
to support the main memory management
layer three, memory management- manages primary memory and the version memory can be implemented
at this level
layer four, file system- it has the facilities for storage and manipulation of named files
placing punched cards in card readers, etcetera
layer five, command language interpreter- it provides an interface between interactive
users and operating system
these input lines are then passed to separate commands from parameters and to identify the
type of service required
bootstrapping or booting- booting is a bootstrapping process that starts operating system, when
the user turns on a computer system
a boot sequence is the initial set of operations that the computer performs when power is switched on
the boot loader typically loads the main operating system for the computer
a computer central processor can only execute program code found in read only memory, random
access memory or from an operator's console
the execution of each job was handled as an isolated activity like the machine was prepared
modern operating systems and application program code and data are stored on non-volatile data
storage devices such as hard drives, cd, dvd, usb flash drive, and floppy disk
when a computer is first powered on, that usually does not have an operating system
in rom or ram
the computer must execute a relatively small program stored in rom, along with a minimum
of data needed to access the non-volatile devices from which the operating system programs
in data are loaded into ram
the small program that starts this sequence of loading into ram is known as a bootstrap
loader, bootstrap or boot loader
this small boot loader program's only job is to load other data and programs which are
for executing, after execution all the tapes and cards to be removed before the next program
then executed from ram
often multiple stage boot loaders are used during which several programs of increasing
complexity sequentially load one after the other in the process of chain loading
types of operating systems- the operating system is the most important software to run
a computer
it is the one who takes care of everything on a computer system
operating systems can be branched into several different types, some of them are given below
batch processing operating system- in a batch processing operating system, interaction between
the user and processor is limited or there is no interaction at all during the execution
of work
begin
data and programs that need to be processed are bundled and collected as a batch and executed
together
batch processing operating systems are most appropriate in situations like there are large
amounts of data to be processed or similar data needs to be processed or similar processing
is involved when executing the data
the system is capable of identifying the idle times of the processor at which time batches
may be processed
processing performed automatically without any user intervention
in a batch processing system, the memory is divided into two at any time, the system area
and the user area
when the number of users is increased, signup sheets were issued to reserve the machine
in order to provide maximum space to the user program and overlay structure is used to store
the monitor program in the system area
a memory protection mechanism is used to ensure that user jobs does not corrupt the batch
monitor court
multi programming operating system- it has the interleaved execution of two or more different
and independent programs by the same computer
the goal is to improve the system utilization by exploiting the concurrency between the
cpu and the io subsystem
the basic idea is that while the io subsystem is busy with an io operation, for one usage
job, the cpu can execute another user job
for blocks of time
since the operating speed of the cpu is much higher than that of io operations, the cpu
can allocate time to several programs instead of remaining idle
the number of programs actively competing for system resources of a multi programming
system is called the degree of multi programming
types of multi programming systems- one is multitasking
in this type of operating system, several applications may be simultaneously loaded
and used in the memory
while the processor handles only one application at a particular time, it is capable of switching
between the applications effectively to execute each application
this type of operating system is seen everywhere today, and is the most common type of operating system
during the time allocated for a user, the machine was totally under that user's control
example windows operating system
another is multi user
this type of operating system allows multiple users to simultaneously use the system
the processor splits its resources and handles one user at a time
the speed and efficiency at which it does this makes it apparent that users are simultaneously
using the system
some network systems utilize this kind of operating system
yet another type is multi-processor
these types of operating systems manage the operations of computer systems that incorporate
multiple processes
in such an environment operating system began systems for simplifying program setup and
time sharing operating system- multi programming operating systems are not suitable for interactive
type applications where the user directly interacts with the computer system
time sharing concept was introduced to provide fast response time to interactive users of
a computer system
to provide good response times to all users, the time-sharing supervisor should ensure
that no programs should be allowed to monopolize the cpu
two provisions are made to ensure this
one is programs are not assigned fixed priorities
and the second, a program can only consume a limited amount of cpu time in one go
real time operating system- a real time operating system processes inputs simultaneously fast
the transition between jobs
enough to affect the next input or process
real time systems are usually used to to control complex systems that require a lot of processing
like machinery and industrial systems
these systems are characterized by having time as a key factor
if the action must occur at a certain moment, the system is known as hard real time system
in a soft real-time system missing an occasional deadline is acceptable
to use a computer as a system, it should have a user interface to communicate with the hardware
a operating system is the one which takes care of the entire computer system
more than an interface to the hardware, it controls the various resources associated
with it
as a first step, physical transition of people in and out of the computer room was eliminated
operating system is the software, which coordinates a computer's internal activities and controls
in this module, an overview of the operating system is presented it refers to the history
various components and the structure of an operating system
this module also covers the different types, user interfaces of the operating system as well
this module ends with a reference to the various types of operating system
distinguish between system software and application software

system

give the structure of an operating system?

hope you enjoyed this session
see you next time
until then, bye
anyone requiring a program run, was to submit it along with any required data and directions
the operator load these materials into the machine storage and a program called operating
system will execute them one at a time
starting from there, now the operating system is of different varieties such as multi-user,
multitasking, real time network or distributed
relationship of operating system to basic hardware is given in the figure
here the main functions of operating systems such as memory management, processor management,
device management and information management interacts with the actual hardware of the computer
without any software, the computer can be treated as a bare machine, which means that
the overall operation of a computer
it constitutes only the hardware components that cannot be fruitfully used by a user
first generation- the first-generation computers used vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic
drums for memory and were very large in size, taking up entire rooms
they were very expensive to operate
these computers used great amount of electricity and generated a lot of heat, which often resulted
in malfunctions
in these days, a single group of people designed, built, programmed, operated and maintained
each machine
all programming was done in machine language, using plug boards and wires to control the
basic functions
it is a collection of system programs that allow the user to run program software
hence, the need of operating systems was not even thought of
all the problems were straight numerical calculations for doing sines, cosines, and logarithmic
operations
by nineteen fifties, punched cards were introduced by which programs can be written on cards
and read them instead of using plug boards
the univac and eniac computers are examples of first-generation computing devices
second generation- the use of transistors changed the picture of computer itself
computers could be manufactured and sold to paying customers
to run a job, the programmer would first write the program on paper, then punch it on cards
then bring the card deck to the input room and hand it to one of the operators and wait
without an operating system, a computer is only a raw machine, which cannot be used for
for a long time
when the computer finished the job, the operator would go to the printer and get the output
to the output room so that, it can be collected by the programmer later
so, the people who paid high costs for equipment looked for ways to reduce the wasted time
the solution adopted was the batch system
second generation computers were largely used for scientific and engineering applications
using fortran and assembly language
typical operating systems were fortran monitoring system, fms and ibsys which is ibm’s operating
system for the system seven zero nine four
third generation- by the early nineteen sixties, most of the computer manufacturers had two
any useful purposes
incompatible product lines
one type is a word oriented large-scale scientific computer such as seven zero nine four, which
were used for numerical calculations
the other is the character oriented commercial computer like one four zero one, which were
widely used for tape sorting and printing by bands
ibm introduced the system three sixty for solving both these problems
the three sixty was a series of software compatible machines ranging from one four zero one size
to much more powerful than seven zero nine four
since all the machines had the same architecture and instruction set, programs written for
one machine could be run on all the others
it provides the means by which a user can store and retrieve files and also an interface
ibm has compatible successors to the three sixty line known as three seventy, four-three-zero-zero,
three-zero-eight-zero, and three-zero-nine-zero series
the systems of the nineteen sixties were also batch processing systems, but they were able
to take better advantage of the computer's resources by running several jobs at once
so, operating system designers developed the concept of multi programming in which several
jobs are in main memory at once
a processor is switched from job to job as needed to keep several jobs advancing while
keeping the peripheral devices in use
for example, on the system with no multi programming, when the current job is waiting for other
io operation to complete, the cpu has to sit idle until the io finished
by which a user can request the execution of programs
the solution for this problem that evolved was to partition memory into several pieces
with a different job in each partition
while one job was waiting for io to complete, another job could be using the cpu
another major feature in third generation operating system was the technique called
spooling or simultaneous peripheral operations online
in spooling, a high-speed device like a disk in the post between a running program and
the low speed device involved with the program in input or output
instead of writing directly to a printer, for example, outputs are returned to the disk
programs can run to completion faster, and other programs can be initiated sooner
when the printer becomes available, the outputs may be printed
it acts as an intermediate between a user and a computer
welcome back
this module of the operating system is called the io traffic controller
decide what is an efficient way to locate the io devices, this is the job of the io
scheduler
allocate the io devices and initiate io operation
information management- many system calls excess for transferring information between
the user program and operating system
the operating system keeps information about all its processes and there are system calls
to access this information
sometimes they will be call to reset the process information, files are abstract resources
of storage devices
operating system runs in kernel mode or supervisor mode and is protected from users by the hardware
information stored in main memory will be overwritten as soon as the memory is deallocated
from a process
information to be save must be copied to a storage device and information management
refers to a set of service used for storing, retrieving, modifying or removing information
on various devices
as a part of information management the operating system performs the following actions,
keep track of the information, its location, use, status, etcetera, these collective facilities
are called file system, enforce protection requirements and provides access routines,
allocate information example, open a file, deallocate example, close a file
services of the operating system in this regard are create a file, create a directory, open and close a file,
roles of an operating system - without an operating system a computer is little more
read data from file to buffer, write data from buffer to file, create a link
and change working directory, etcetera
processes- a process is a program in execution represented by the tuple, process id, code,
data, register values and pc values
the process is the smallest unit of work individually scheduled by an operating system
an operating system creates a process in response to a request from the user to activate an
executable program
once created a process becomes active and eligible to compete for system resources such
as processor and io devices the concept of program and process are different
process is a dynamic concept undergoing frequent state and attribute changes while an executable
than a bundle of plastic, metal and a few bits of expensive silicone
program or job is a static process template that may give rise to one or more processes
implementation of a process- to implement the process model operating system maintains
a table called process table with one entry per process
this entry contains information about the process state, its program counter, stack
pointer, memory allocation, the status of its open files, its accounting and scheduling
information, etcetera
although the exact <?>*</?> contained in the process table vary from system to system
there will be some fields for process management, some for memory management and some other
for file management etcetera
when a process is created, the operating system performs the following actions- create a process
most of the software runs on a computer but the operating system is the software that
control block for the process, assigns process id and priority, allocates memory and other
resources to the process, set a process any environment, initialize resource accounting
information for the process
process control blocks- to keep track of all information concerning a process the operating
system groups all the information that it needs about a particular process into a data
structure called process descriptor or process control block or pcb
whenever a process is created the operating system creates a corresponding pcb to serve
its runtime description during the lifetime of the process
when the process terminates its pcb is removed
the pcb of process contains information concerning the following- process scheduling information,
runs the computer
information concerning memory and resource allocated, pointers to the next pcb in the
process scheduling list
the process scheduling information consists of id, priority, state and descriptions of
execution status
this information is collectively called process status vector
the structure of a pcb is given in the following figure
process states- a process can go through a series of discrete process takes
the four general categories of process states are dormant or hold, ready, running and blocked
or suspended
the dormant state denotes processes that are not known to and therefore not tracked by
the operating system performs basically two unrelated task such as extending the machine
the operating system
inter process communication- processes frequently need to communicate with other processes
the communication between processes need to be in a well-structured way not using interrupts
the cooperating process can communicate in a shared memory environment
another way to achieve the same is by the inter process communication or ipc facility
provided by the operating system
ipc provides a mechanism to allow process to communicate and to synchronize their actions
ipc is best provided by a message system
the function of a message system is to allow processes to communicate with each other without
the need to restore the shared variables
and managing resources
another is the indirect method in which messages are sent and received using mailboxes
there are also some issues related to the inter process communication or ipc
they are briefly discussed below
first is race condition
processes working together often share some common storage that each one can read and write
when two or more processes are reading or writing some share data and the final research
depend on who runs precisely when is called race condition
for example, in the filesystems two or more programs may collide in their attempts to
modify or access a file which could results in data corruption
file locking provides a commonly used solution
the computer consists of processors, memories, timers, disks, network interfaces, printers, etcetera
critical sections- race condition and many other troubles of ipc is due to the use of
shared memory and shared files
so to avoid these problems there should be some mechanism to prohibit more than one process
from reading and writing the shared data at the same time
the part of the program where the shared memory is accessed is called the critical section
if we could have in mechanism to prevent any two processes from entering into their critical
sections at the same time race condition can be avoided
the solution to the problem of race conditions need to have the following four conditions-
no two processes may be simultaneously inside their critical sections
no assumptions may be made about the speed or the number of cpu cycles
hence, the job of the operating system is the controlled allocation of the various resources
no process running outside its critical section may block other processes
no process should have to wait forever to enter its critical section
handling competition among process- an important task of an operating system is the allocation
of the machinery resources to the processes in the system
resources include the machine’s peripheral devices as well as features within the machine
the resource allocation is a complex task which causes malfunctions in the system severe
of damage the deadlock
so there are many techniques used to handle the competition among processes for resources
semaphore- consider a time sharing operating system controlling the activities of a computer
with a single printer
for the different programs requested for them
today we are going to discuss about the functions of operating system
to control access to the printer by multiple processes at the same time operating system
must keep track of whether the printer has been located
one approach is to use a flag, whose states are often referred to as set and clear
a clear flag or value zero indicates that the printer is available and a set flag of
value one indicates that the printer is currently allocated but this simple flat system has
a problem
the task of testing and possibly setting the flag may require several machine instructions
it is therefore possible for a task to be interrupted after a clear flag has been detected
but before the flag has been set
when this process is interrupted another process will get the time slides and it may also request
operating systems are designed to provide uniform abstraction across multiple applications
for the printer
after sometime when the original process resumes, it will start from where it has stopped
so it had read the value of flag which is zero and request for the printer and set the flag
this process will be given access to the printer
now the situation is two processes are using the same printer which is of no use
the solution to this is to insist that the task of testing and setting the flag be completed
without interruption
one approaches to use the interrupt disable and interrupt enable instruction but this
is not optimal because it may block future interrupt
a properly implemented flag called semaphore is used in software systems in much the same
as an interface – the architecture of most computers at the mission language level is
way as they are in railway system
corresponding to the section of track that can contain only one train at a time is the
critical section that can be executed by only one process at a time, that is mutual exclusion
to a critical region is obtained by using semaphores
to enter the critical section process must find the semaphore clear and then set semaphore
before entering critical region, then upon exiting the process must clear the semaphore
if the semaphore is found to be in its set state the process trying to enter the critical
region must wait until the semaphore has been clear
deadlock- another problem that can arise during resource allocation is deadlock
the condition in which two or more processors are blocked from progressing because each
primitive and difficult to program especially for input or output
is waiting for a resource that is allocated to another but deadlock can occur only if
all four of the following conditions are satisfied
mutual exclusion- the resources are acquired and used in a mutually exclusive
manner hold and wait- each process continues to hold resources already allocated to it while waiting
for other resources
no preemption- resources allocated to one process can be retrieved from it only by the
voluntary action of that process
circular wait- deadlocked processes are involved in a circular chain
the deadlock problem can be removed by attacking any one of these conditions
the occurrence of deadlock is considered so remote that no effort is made avoid the problem
the program that hides the truth about the hardware from the programmer and presence
instead the approaches to detect it, then correct it by forcibly retrieving some of the
allocated resources
in this module we have discussed about the various functions of operating system such
as interfacing and resource management
the different functions such as memory management, device management, process management and
information management are discussed in detail
the concept of process and various activities of processes are referred here
the operating system plays an important role in handling the competition among different
processes and allocating various resources to processes
this modulus ends with a reference to the various problems of inter-process communication
a nice simple view of named files that can be read and written is the operating system
please try to answer the following questions
list four activities of a typical operating system
what information is contained in a process table within an operating system?
what is the difference between a process that is ready and a process that is waiting?
identify the components of the state of a process?
what is meant by a semaphore?

hope you enjoy this session
see you next time
until then bye
a simple file oriented interface and also conceals a lot of unpleasant things concerning
interrupts, timers, memory management and other low level features
in each case the abstraction offered by the operating system is simpler and easier to
use than that offered by the underlying hardware
operating system is the most fundamental of all the system programs
in this view the function of the operating system is to present the user with the equivalent
of an extended machine or virtual machine that is easier to program than the underlying hardware
as a resource manager- an operating system is a set of programs that is used to manage
various resources and overall operations of a computer system
resource management includes sharing resources in two ways with time and space
when a resource is time shared the different programs or users may use them in different turns
for example, if there is only one cpu and multiple programs want to run them the operating
system first allocate the cpu to one program and after a certain period of time it will
allocate cpu to the next program and then to the next and then so on
the other type of sharing is space sharing
it is a layer of software on top of the hardware which constitutes the system and manages instructions
instead of taking turns the customer gets parts of the resource
for example, main memory is divided among several running programs so that each one
can be in the main memory at the same time
basic functionalities of an operating system- operating system provides a number of services
at the lowest level system calls allow a running program to make requests from the operating
system directly
since an operating system is large, modularity is important
process management- in deals with the assignment of processor to different task been performed
by the computer system
the functions for process management are kept track of active process, the part of the program
to work with
that is processed by the cpu by means of some data structure that depict the state of the system
the operating system contains a scheduler that selects which process to running next
when running process is switched off, when allocating the cpu to a new process
the kernel saves the state of the departing process and restores the state of the incoming
process which is known as conduct switch
the operating system is responsible for the following activities in connection with process
management
the creation and deletion of both user and system processes, the supervision and assumption
of processes, the provision of machanism for process synchronization, the provision of
mechanism for process communication, the provision of mechanisms for deadlock handling
it also provides an easy to use interface to the users
the program that keeps track of the processes and status of the process is called the traffic controller
the process scheduler is the program that decides which process get the processor when
and how much
allocating the processor to a process by setting up necessary hardware registers if the job
of the dispatcher, so the system calls or services associated with these functions include
create a process, destroy a process, suspend a process, resume a process and change the
priority of a process, block a process, wake up a process and dispatch a process
memory management- memory is a large array of words or bytes having a unique address
the main purpose of a computer system is program execution
these programs are in main memory during execution with the data they access
the major function of an operating system is to hide the inner complexity of the hardware
main memory is generally the only storage device that the cpu is able to address directly
but main memory is too small to accommodate all the data and programs, so computer system
provides secondary storage to backup main memory
the memory management functions include memory protection mechanism, member swapping mechanism
and virtual memory mechanism such as page fault handling and page replacement
hence the operating system performs the following activities for memory management keep track
of which parts of memory are currently being used and by whom, decide which process is
to be loaded into memory when memory space becomes available and how much, allocate and
reclaim memory space as needed
for the secondary storage or disk management the operating system performs the following
and give the programmer a friendly and convenient set of instructions to work with
functions, free space management, storage allocation, disk scheduling
the operating system keeps a list of free memory before loading a program into memory
from disk, the required memory area is allocated to it and the operating system updates the
list of free memory
services of the operating system in this regards are allocate a chunk of memory to process,
free a chunk of memory from a process
device management- one of the roles of an operating system is to hide the complexity
of specific hardware devices from the user, only the device driver knows the features
of specific device to which it is assigned
the different components for this are a buffer caching system, a general device driver interface,
the operating system provide the support for all other system programs such as compilers
drivers for specific hardware devices
a program as it is running may need additional resources to proceed such as more memory,
tape drive, access to files, etcetera
if the resources are available they can be branded and control can be returned to the
user program
most operating system treat all devices such as disk, tape, terminals and printers in the
same general manager with special management for the processor and memory
device management refers to the way these generic devices are handled
so the task of operating system to accomplish device management is keep track of the io
devices, channels and control link
and editors and application programs like accounting software and games
welcome back
in the text environment english like words are used and is similar to that of third-generation languages
in a fourth generation language visual environment or the programmer uses a toolbar to drag and
drop various items like button, text boxes, labels, etcetera to create a visual definition
of an application like user interface or reports
most third generation languages and fourth generation languages allow the programmer
to work in an integrated development environment or ide
an ide is a programming environment which presents aids for designing, coding, editing,
debugging and testing the program
fourth generation languages also include the ordering environments for creating multimedia
application, computer based training program, web pages, etcetera
large programs can contain thousands of individual files each for a specific purpose
fifth generation languages - the fifth generation languages are actually of a little bit confusing
some experts consider the more advanced ordering environment to be fifth generation languages,
while other do not
on principal a fifth generation language would use artificial intelligence to create software
based on user's descriptions
programming paradigms – the generation approach of classifying programming language is based
on a linear scale on which a language is positioned as determined by the degree to which the user
of the language is freed from the features of computer and allowed to think in terms
of associated with the problem
the historical development of programming languages is represented in the following figure
some files contain instructions while some other contains data
the figure shows four paths the presenting the functional, object-oriented, imperative
and declarative paradigms with different languages associated with each paradigm positioned in
a manner that indicates that development relative to other languages
the imperative paradigm or the procedure paradigm represents the traditional approach to the
programming process
the imperative paradigm defines the programming process to be the development of sequence
of commands that when followed manipulate data to produce the desired result
hence, the imperative paradigm gives the approach of programming process by finding an algorithm
to solve the problem and expressing that algorithm as a sequence of commands
the decorative paradigm asks a programmer to describe the problem to be solved rather
although a computer’s code must consist of zeros and ones, computer programmers use
than an algorithm to be followed
that is a declarative programming system applies a pre-established general purpose problem
solving algorithm to solve problems presented to it
the other programming paradigm is called the functional paradigm in which the program is
viewed as an entity that accepts input and produces the output
by this paradigm a program is constructed by connecting smaller predefined program units
or predefined function so that the output from each unit can be felt as the input to
the next unit
another programming paradigm is the object oriented paradigm which is associated with
the programming process called object oriented programming or oop
programming languages instead of binary
here a software system is viewed as a collection of units called objects
these objects are capable of performing the actions that are immediately related to itself
as well as requesting actions of other objects
these objects would be associated with a collection of procedures call methods describing how
that object is to respond to the occurrence of various events
the systems development life cycle for programming
programs are the fundamental units of information systems
to create software products programmer follows a series of processes or lifecycle
phase one - needs analysis
after the problem is identified and understood the programmer checks the program designed
programming languages helps the programmer to describe a program using a variation of
to see what the user needs the program to do
before beginning the design, the programmer has to determine the program starting and
stopping points
phase two - program design
in the design stage the programmer will figure out the logic for coding
many tools are used for designing such as ipo charts for structured programming, circles
and message pipes for object oriented programming and pseudo code, etcetera
phase three – development
development or coding involves writing and testing the source code
the programmer writes codes to implement the requirements of the user
basic english
for the coding the programmer can use a text editor or a visual editor
while coding there are chances for errors or bugs in the program
the two main types of bugs are syntax errors and logic errors
the syntax errors occurs when the rules of the programming languages are violated
the compiler or interpreter will point out these errors and hence finding out this type
of errors is relatively easy
logic errors are the mistakes in algorithm are difficult to find out and may not even
noticed before implementation
the process of identifying and eliminating this error is called debugging
phase four – implementation
this is called the source code
implementation involves installing software and allowing users to test it by using
this step often consists of a lot of documentation both inside the code and in the form of manuals
for the users
before implementation all the misconception of the programmer about the codes are found
and fixed
phase five – maintenance
maintenance starts as soon as the program is installed
work continues due to several reasons
some minor bugs may not have been fixed at the time of program released
sometimes there may be some minor addition or sometime major modifications in response
evolution of programming languages – programming is a way of creating a set of instructions
to the user request
this is the longest phase of the program development life cycle with last for several years
traditional programming concepts - here we are going to have a discussion on some of
the constant found in imperative and object oriented programming languages
c is a third-generation imperative language, c plus plus is an object oriented language
which is an extension of c java and c sharp are object oriented languages derived from
c plus plus
whatever may be the basic concepts followed in each language, the statements in the programming
languages tend to be fall into three categories declarative statements, imperative statements
and comments
for the computer
declarative statements define customize terminology used in the program
these are the names used to reference data items, imperative statements describe steps
in the underlying algorithm
comments are used to enhance the readability of a program
it explains the features of program in a human understandable form
variables and data types - high level programming languages allow the main memory locations
to be a referenced by descriptive name rather than numbers
such a name is known as a variable which implies that the values taught at each location will
be changing as the program executes
the programming languages require that these variables be identified through declarative
to develop these instructions programmers use the well-defined programming languages
in this module we are going to discuss about programming languages
statement before being used in the program
these declarative statements require the programmer to specify the type of data that will be stored
at the memory locations reference by variables
such a type is known as a data type and encompasses the manner in which the data item is encoded
and the operations that can be performed on that data
the type integer refers to numeric data consisting of whole numbers which will be stored in two’s
complement form and the operations associated with integer data include arithmetic operations,
logical operations, etcetera
an integer type variable to be used in a program should be declared toward the beginning of
the program as int limit, which means that limit is a variable which will be used later
to create source code, then convert the source code into object code for the computer
in this program to refer to a memory area containing a value stored in two’s complement form
the real type or float refers to the numeric data other than whole numbers
these are stored in floating point notation and the operations associated with are similar
to those of integers
other common data types used are character and boolean
character refers to the data consisting of symbols and stored in ask key and unicode
the operations performed on this data include the comparison, concatenation, etcetera
the statement char letter could be used in c, c plus plus, c sharp and java to declare
the variable letter to be of type char
the type boolean refers to data items that can take only true or false values
machine code consisting of zeros and ones is the only language understood by the computer
the operation of boolean includes enquiries as to whether the current value is true or false
the type such as int, char, float, boolean are called the primitive types
the translator uses the knowledge from the declaration statements to translate it into
machine language and to signal the errors in operation
data structure – the programs are often associated with certain data structure which
is the conceptual shape or arrangement of data
for example, text is normally viewed as a long string of characters
student records may be viewed as a rectangular table where each row represents the associated
information about a particular student
one common data structure used in programming languages is the homogeneous array
but programming using ones and zeros is difficult and error-prone and hence researchers develop
which is a collection of values of the same type
the arrays can be one dimensional as a list, two dimensional as a table or with tables
of higher dimension
to establish such an array, most of the programming languages require the declaration statement
to specify the name of the array along with the length of each dimension of the array
in mask five, ten, means that the variable mask will be used in the program to refer
to a two dimensional array of integers having five rows and ten columns
once a homogeneous array has been declared it can be referenced in the program by its
name and the individual components or items can be referenced by specifying the indices
that specify the row and column
more sophisticated programming languages
for example, the statement mask two four refers to the individual component stored in mask
in the fourth column of the second row
there is also a heterogeneous array which represents a block of data in which different
elements can have different types
these are referred to as structure and declared as struct, open brace, char name of twenty,
int age, float gradepoint, then close brace, student, which says that variable student
is referred to a structure consisting of three members call name, age, and gradepoint
constants and literals – sometimes a fixed predetermined value is used in the program
for example, the program for controlling the air traffic in a particular airport contains
numerous references to that airports altitude above the sea level, while writing a program
the programming tools are developed to make programming more easily and are used to convert
one can include this value, say seven six five feet literally each time it is required
such an explicit appearance of a value is called a literal
the use of literals leads to program statements such as effective alt equal to alt plus seven
six five, where effective alt and alt are assumed to be variable and seven six five
is a literal
in most programming languages literals are delineated with quotation marks to distinguish
them from other program components
often the use of literals mask the meaning of the statements in which they appear
moreover, literals complicate the task of modifying the program
to solve this problems programming languages allow descriptive names to be assigned to
the human like instruction into strings of ones and zeros
specific non-changeable values
such a name is called constant
for example, const int altitude equal to seven six five associates the identifier altitude
with the fixed value seven six five
with this, the above statement can be rewritten as effective alt equal to alt plus altitude
while modifying the program it needs only a single change to the declaration statement
of the constant
assignments statements – once the terminologies to be used in the program have been declared
a programmer can start describing the algorithm involved
this is done by means of imperative statements
to use any of the programming languages the programmer has to follow some rules like providing
the most basic imperative statement is the assignment statement which requests that a
value be assigned to a variable
the statement sum equal to num one plus num two in c, c plus plus, c sharp and java requests
that the sum of num one and num two be assigned to the variable sum
the power of assignment statements comes from the scope of expressions that can appear on
the right side of the statement
many programming languages allow the use of one symbol to represent more than one operation
in these cases the meaning of the symbol is determined by the data type of the operands
for example, the symbol plus represents addition when used with numeric and the same symbol
when used with a character strings results in
information in certain order and structure using special symbols, using punctuations,
concatenation such multiple use of an operation symbol is called overloading
control statements – a control statement is an imperative statement that alters the
execution sequence of the program
modern languages are designed with control statements that allow an entire branching
structure to be expressed within a
single statement the commonly used control structures in high level programming languages are if then else,
while, case and for
the if-then-else allows a choice between two options and while repeats the statements if
the specified condition is true
case is a multi-way selection statement in which the selection is based on the same expression
etcetera
or variable
the for is a loop structure similar to while, but the difference is that the initialization,
modification and the termination of law is incorporated in a parenthetical structure
within the single statement
comments – though the programming language is well designed, additional information is
helpful when a human tries to read and understand a well featured program
for this the programming languages provide ways of inserting explanatory statements called
comments within the program
these statements are ignored by the translator
without such documentation large complex programs are difficult for a programmer other than
these rules are called the syntax of the programming language
software provides the instructions that run the hardware in a computer
its developer to understand and modify if necessary
there are two common ways of inserting comments in a program, one is to surround the entire
comment by special markers and the other at the beginning of the comments at one end
the single line comments are marked as to begin with double slashes, while the other
this is a comment, start slash are valid comments
a good approach to put comments is by collecting the comments that relate to a single program
and put it at the beginning of the unit
this will increase the readability of the program
let us summarize the module
the syntax of one language is different from the other
in this module we have discussed the basic features of a programming language
we covered the topics such as the history and evolution of programming languages, the
fundamental building blocks of the programming language such as variables, data types, data
structures, constants, literals and the control constructs
we concluded by referring to the statements such as assignment and comments
please try to answer the following questions
explain the evolution of the programming language?
what are the different programming paradigms?
differentiate between machine level language and high level language?
write a note on machine language?
the programming languages can be grouped in different ways
what is meant by assembly language?
explain the system development life cycle for programming
what is meant by a data structure?
what is the role of comments in programming?
hope you enjoyed this session
see you next time, until then bye
based on history programming languages are divided into three categories such as machine
level, assembly level, and higher level
machine and assembly languages – the fundamental of all languages is the machine language
the machine code consisting of ones and zeros is created using machine language
each computer program written in other computer languages is translated to machine language
before running that program
each type of computer has its own mission language
as mission language is the language of the cpu, programs written in this language are
software tells the computer what to do
executed very fast
but writing programs in machine language is very time consuming and error-prone
programs written in machine language are not portable and the programmer need to know how
each instruction affects the memory and register in the cpu
because of these limitations programs are rarely written in machine language nowadays
assembly language is one level above the machine language
it uses certain predefine symbolic codes called mnemonics instead of binary codes
remembering mnemonics is easier than remembering binary codes
so, writing programs in assembly language is easier and less time consuming compared to
writing programs in machine language
this software refers to a set of programs that gives the direction to the computer of
assembly language closely resembles machine language and both are considered low level languages
since, a computer cannot understand assembly language program written in assembly language
must be translated into an equivalent machine language program before it can be run
the translation of an assembly language program into machine language program is done by a program called
assembler
it also assembles the mission codes in the primary memory of the computer and makes it
ready for execution
a symbolic program written by a programmer in assembly language is called source program
after the source program has been converted into machine language by an assembler it is
referred to as an object program
doing the work assigned to it
limitations of machine language and assembly languages – writing programs is difficult
and time consuming, cpu specific, not portable, programmer need to know the inner details
of the system
higher level languages - high level languages overcome these limitations to a large extent
higher level programming languages used familiar words rather than the details strings of digits
that make up machine instruction
for representing computer operations these languages use operator such as plus minus
signs etcetera, by this people can read, write and understand computer programs easily
some of the common high level languages are fortran, cobol, c, c plus plus, java, etcetera
but the programs written in high level languages must be translated into equivalent machine
a computer program on the other hand is a set of instructions or statements or code
language program
this is done using translation programs like compilers and interpreters
the interpreter translates the program written in a high level language into machine language
at the time of executing that program instruction by instruction
therefore, no object code is saved for future use
while using an interpreter the translation and execution process alternate
the compiler translates the entire high level language program into equivalent machine language
program called a object program before executing it
these subject codes will be saved permanently, hence the program can be executed without
compiling in the future
executed by the computer cpu
programming languages are sometimes referred in terms of generation
machine languages are called first generation languages and assembly languages are called
second generation languages
third generation languages – the third generation languages helped to write structured program easier
these languages used english like phrasing and allowed the sharing of programs even though
each of the third generation languages has its own syntax their english like and easy
to understand
another important advantage of third generation languages is portability
in order to port the code from one system to another the only condition is that the
new system should have a compiler or interpreter to create an executable from the source code
a program is typically composed of a main module and sub-module
since the statements in a third generation language could theoretically be created on
any machine simply by applying the appropriate compiler, but in reality it is not that much simple
when a compiler is designed particular characteristics of the underlying machine are reflected as
conditions on the language being translated
this problem of portability is mainly due to the lack of standards
to aid in this regard the american national standards institute and the international
organization for standardization have adopted and published standards for many of the popular languages
fourth generation languages - fourth generation languages are easier to use than the third
generation languages
these languages use either the text environment or a visual environment
these models are stored as a collection of files
﻿welcome back in this module we are going to discuss about software engineering
mainly categorized as high level or conceptual design and detailed design the conceptual design
provides only a conception or logical view of the overall system the details are not specified
during the detailed design process the inner details of how the system can be implemented will
be specified the design of the software includes the design of user interfaces such as input
and output the other major considerations are database, procedure, control, and documentation
implementation - implementation involves the actual coding of programs, creation of data files,
and development of data bases implementation is considered to be a bottom-up process in which
individual modules are program and then combined to form larger components
commonly used approach is to construct the partial modules and used in larger components and then
expand to complete fully functional components another structural way to implement the software
development period, hence the software engineering should include the personnel management
is a top down approach in which a skeletal version of the entire system is implemented
first and then later provides a complete system a programmer rather than a software analyst
contributes to the implementation process a programmer is assigned with writing programs
to implement the design produced at the earliest stage even though we made a distinction between
the analyst and a programmer, today the steps in software development process are in the mixed
testing – testing is of two types one is validation testing to confirm that the
software system implemented is according to the requirements and specifications identified during
analysis phase the other is defect testing to identify and correct errors in the program
but even after the satisfactory completion of the testing phase, it is not possible to assure that a
program is error-free since the input data domain of most of the programs is very large, it is not
and project management apart from computer science, but in this module topics related
possible to test the program for each value in the input domain thus, testing involves a set of test
inputs or test cases and observe the behavior of the program whether it is as expected
the commonly used terms associated with testing are error it’s a mistake committed
during the development phase the error is also termed as fault, bug or defect
of the system and expected output of the system test suite – it is a set of all test cases with
which a software product is tested the testing process is depicted in the following figure
there are two main approaches to systematic design of test cases they are black box testing
and white box testing in the black box testing approach the test cases are designed
using the functional specifications of the software without any knowledge about the internal
to computer science are discussed the software engineering discipline - the problems involved
structure of the software so the black box testing is also known as functional testing
the white box test cases require a deep knowledge about the internal structure of the program and
are also called structural testing both validation testing and defect testing are
closely associated with implementation each module in a well-designed system can be tested
independently of the others by using simplified version of the other modules to simulate the
interactions between the testing module and other parts of the system as the individual modules
are completed these are combined to the larger system and leads to overall system testing
experience has shown that even after significance testing the large software systems contains
numerous errors, some of these may not be detected during the lifetime of the system
but, some others may cause severe damages the software engineering is to eliminate these errors
in software engineering are estimating the cost in time, money and other resources to complete
and hence need lots of research now, let us summaries what we have discussed in this module
this module provides an introduction to the broad field of software engineering this module starts
with a comparison of software engineering with traditional engineering discipline and our view
of the software engineering tools and various phases of software engineering are given here
since, the development phase is of major consideration,
the development life cycle of a software product is discussed in some detail this
module concludes by pointing to the importance of research in the software engineering field
before we attend the next unit please try to answer the following questions
what are the major distinction between software engineering and other engineering discipline?
suggest any good metric for measuring the complexity of a program? what are the
the project, dividing the project into manageable modules, ensuring the compatibility of modules,
different phases of a software development life cycle? what are the different types
of testing associated with a software system implementation? what is meant by case tools?
compare between procedure and function write a note on software requirement specification
books for your reference j glenn brookshear, computer science- an overview, tenth edition,
addison-wesley rajib mall, fundamentals of software engineering, third edition, phi
communication among various parts of the systems, measuring the progress, etcetera
since engineering is a well-established field, there are some previously developed techniques
to face with some of the above mentioned problems, but there may be fundamental differences between
the properties of software and those of other fields of engineering these may lead
to cost overrun, late delivery of products, and dissatisfaction of customers such distinction
the objectives of this module are to understand the importance of software engineering,
deals with constructing systems from prefabricated generic components in the traditional engineering
discipline the off-the-shelf components can be used to construct a more complex device
but in software engineering previously designed components may be domain specific and internal
design is based on specific application hence the use of generic components
is limited so the complex software systems should be started from scratch
another difference between the software engineering and other engineering disciplines is
the lack of matrix or quantitative techniques for measuring the properties of the software there
are some methods of measuring the complexity and quality of a product in traditional engineering
discipline, but in the case of software products these methods cannot be applicable
thus, research in software engineering is currently progressing on two dimensions
to get an idea about the issues related to the development of a software, to study about
some researchers called practitioners work towards developing techniques for immediate
application the other type of researchers called theoreticians search for principles
and theories on which most stable techniques can be constructed in the present scenario
we are mostly dependent upon large software systems every field of life like economy, health,
government, transportation, defense, etcetera is using software systems for their processing
this implies that software errors can cause disasters and the progress of practitioners
and theoreticians is enormous the application of computer technology
to the software development process results in computer aided software engineering or case
case tools include project planning systems, project management systems, documentation tools,
prototyping and simulation systems, interface design systems and programming systems
the significance of software engineering apart from traditional engineering, to understand
once a project is found to be feasible, project planning is to be done by the project managers
this planning is to be completed before the beginning of any development activity the
project planning system support the major activities of project planning such as
cost estimation, project scheduling and personal allocation
the goal of software project management is to enable a group of software developers
to work efficiently towards successful completion of the project project management systems assist
in monitoring the progress of the development project and documentation tools assist in
writing and organizing documentation a prototype is a rough implementation of the
system these are built using shortcuts and a very crude version of the actual systems the prototype
is used to illustrate the input data formats, reports, messages and interactive dialogues
the different phases of software development to learn the software life cycle
to gain the understanding of user needs these prototypes can be developed using the
prototyping and simulation systems the interface design systems assist in the gui development
writing and debugging programs are supported by programming systems
some more sophisticated case tools include code generators that produce high level language
programs if the specification for a part of the system are given besides the research for methods
of developing better quality software systems, professional organizations have contributed
their efforts by setting standards of ethics and professional conduct among their membership
the association of computing machinery or acm and the institute of electrical and electronics
engineering or ieee are at the front to adopt codes of professional conduct and ethics
the software lifecycle - the software life cycle has a well-defined iterative process
software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the principles to guide
the process theoretically never ends as the cycle gets repeated the software life cycle
is the most fundamental concept in software engineering the following figure presents
a view of the software life cycle once the software is developed, it enters a cycle of
being used and modified which continues for the lifetime of the software this is true
for any of the manufacturing product, but in other disciplines a modification is better known
as a repair because they pass deteriorate software does not deteriorate but there may be
some errors found or there may be some changes in the application where the software is used
whatever may be the reason for modification, the program and its documentation should be
well-understood by the person otherwise modification may introduce more problems
than it solves so generally the software part which needs modification as discarded
the software development process which leads to efficient, reliable software products
and develops a new system instead of modifying the existing package
but from experiences it is clear that some effort during the development makes the modifications
easier when required therefore, most of the research in software engineering focuses
on the development stage of the software lifecycle the various phases of
software development are analysis, design, implementation and testing as shown below
analysis - the development phase begins with analysis it is the specification of the services
expected from the proposed system the conditions such as time constraints, security,
etcetera should also be identified analysis phase needs the input from the
future user of the proposed system in a traditional software development context
where the user is an entity, the analysis starts with a feasibility study conducted by the user
the problems faced in developing software systems are similar to writing smaller programs but will
if the software is produced for the mass market to be sold or downloaded through the internet, the
user is less precisely defined entity and analysis begin with a market study as the needs of the
users are identified they have to specify a set of requirements that the new system must satisfy
these requirements as stated in terms of the application, for example, there they must
be restricted to authorize the users after the system requirements are identified they
are converted into more technical specifications hence the above requirements may be stated as the
system will not respond until an approved eight digit password has been type at the keyboard
the analysis phase of the software development concludes with a document
called software requirement specification or srs that identifies the requirements
and specifications of the proposed system the professional organization such as ieee
vary in size and quantity the development of large systems often requires efforts
and large software clients have adopted standards for its composition that is
the software requirement specification is a written agreement between the parties concerned
and is a method of solving the disputes that might arise later in the development process
the software requirement specification should define a firm objective it is assumed that your
communication and changing requirements are the major causes of cost overruns and late delivery
this can be resolved if the requirements are specified and both the parties agreed upon it
design - the analysis concentrated on what the proposed system should do whereas the design
concentrates on how the system will fulfill the requirements at this phase detailed plans
according to the requirement specifications are developed the result will be diagrams
and models of the proposed system with different levels of details the design process can be
of more than one person over some period the personnel assign may change during the
﻿welcome to the session on system tools and utility programs
new hardware and software support firmware will make it possible
for devices to work better with the old and new operating systems and applications
almost all devices and peripherals are embedded with firmware network card, tv tuner, router,
scanner or monitor an examples of devices which have firmware installed on them
programming language translators - these are intermediate programs relied on by software
programmers to translate high level language source code to machine language code the former
is a collection of programming languages that are easy for humans to comprehend and code that is
java, c plus plus, python, php, basic, etcetera the letter is a complex code only understood by
the processor popular language translators are compilers, interpreters, assemblers, linkers,
loaders, and macros they are usually designed by computer manufacturers translator programs may
system software also includes utility software
perform a complete translation of program codes or translate every other instruction at a time
machine code is written in a number system of base two written out in zeros or ones
this is the lowest level language possible while seemingly meaningless to humans the zeros and ones
are actually sequenced intelligently by the processor to refer to every conceivable human
code and word besides simplifying the work of software developers, translators help in
various design task they identify syntax errors during translation, thus allowing changes to be
made to the code provide diagnostic reports whenever the code rules are not followed
allocate data storage for the program list both source code and program details
a brief description of the compilers, interpreters, assemblers, linkers,
loaders and macros are given below compiler – a compiler is a software that translates the code
utility software helps to manage, maintain and control computer resources
written in one language to some other language without changing the meaning of the program
the compiler is also said to make the target code efficient and optimized in terms of time
and space the compiler performs almost all of the following operations during compilation,
pre-processing, lexical analysis, passing, semantic analysis,
that is syntax detected translation, conversion of input programs to an intermediate representation,
code optimization and code generation examples of compiler may include gcc
that is a c compiler, g plus plus for c plus plus compiler, java c for java compiler, etcetera
interpreter – an interpreter is a computer program that directly executes that is it performs
instructions written in a programming of scripting language interpreter does
not require the program to be previously combined into a mission language program
operating systems typically contain the necessary tools for this, but separate utility programs
an interpreter translates high-level instructions into an intermediate form which is then executed
immediately interpreters are fast as it does not need to go through the compilation stage during
which machine instructions are generated interpreter continuously translates the
program until the first error is met if an error comes it stops executing,
hence debugging is easy examples may include ruby, python, php, etcetera assembler – an
assembler is a program that converts assembly language into machine code it takes the basic
commands and operations and converts them into binary code specific to a type of processor
assemblers produce executable code that similar to compilers however, assemblers are more simplistic
since they only convert low level code that is assembly language to machine code
since each assembly language is designed for a specific processor, assembling a program is
can provide improved functionality utility software is often somewhat technical
performed using a simple one to one mapping from assembly code to machine code on the other hand
compilers must convert generic high-level source code into machine code for a specific processor
linker – linker is a program in a system which helps to link an object module of
program into single object file it performs the process of linking linkers are also called
link editors linking is the process of collecting and maintaining pieces of code
and data into a single file linker also links a particular module into system library
it takes object modules from assembler as input and form executable file as output for loader
linking is performed at both compile time when the source code is translated into machine code
and load time when the program is loaded into memory by the loader linking is performed at
the last step in compiling a program linking is of two types, static linking and dynamic linking
and targeted and uses with a solid knowledge of computers system software - system
static linking - it is performed during the compilation of source program
linking is performed before execution in static linking it takes collection of relocatable object
files and command line argument and generate fully lined object files that can be loaded and run
static linker perform two major tasks symbol resolution – it associates each symbol reference
with exactly one symbol definition every symbol have predefined task relocation - it
relocate code and data section and modify symbol references to the relocated memory location
the linker copies or library routines used in the program into executable images as a result
it requires more memory space, hence it does not require the presence of library on the system
when it is run so it is faster and more portable no failure chances and less error chance
dynamic linking - dynamic linking is performed during the runtime
software refers to the files and programs that make up computer's operating system
this linking is accomplished by placing the name of a sharable library in the executable image
there are more chances of errors and failure chances it requires less memory space as multiple
programs can share a single copy of the library loader - as the program that has to be executed
currently must reside in the main memory of the computer it is the responsibility of the loader
a program in an operating system to load the executable file or module of a program generated
by the linker to main memory for execution it allocates memory space to the executable
module in main memory there are three kinds of loading approaches
absolute loading, relocatable loading and dynamic runtime loading absolute loading - this approach
loads the executable file of a program into the same main memory location each time,
but it has some disadvantages like a programmer must be aware of the assignment strategies
system files include libraries of functions, system services, drivers for printers and
for loading the modulus to the main memory in case a program is to be modified involving some
insertion and deletion in the program then all the addresses of the program have to be altered
relocatable loading - in this approach the compiler or assembler does not produce
actual main memory address it produces the relative addresses
dynamic runtime loading - in this approach the absolute address for a program is generated
when an instruction of an executable module is actually executed it is very flexible
the loadable module or executable module can be loaded into any region of main memory
the executing program can be interrupted in between and can be swapped out to the
disk and back to main memory, this time at a different main memory address
macros – a macro is an extension to the basic assembler language they provide a means for
other hardware system, preferences and other configuration files since system software
generating a commonly used sequence of assembler instructions or statements
the sequence of instructions or statements will be coded one time within the macro definition
whenever the sequence is needed within a program the macro will be called macros
allow a programmer to define pseudo operations, typically operations that are generally desirable,
are not implemented as a part of the processor instruction,
and can be implemented as a sequence of instructions each use of a macro generates
new program instructions the macro has the effect of automating writing the program
macros can be defined used in many programming languages like c, c plus plus, etcetera
example macro in c programming – macros are commonly used in c to define small snippets
of code if the macro has parameters, they are substituted into the macro body during expansion,
runs at the most basic level of computer it is called low level software it generates
thus a c macro can mimic a c function the usual reason for doing this is to avoid
the overhead of a function call in simple cases where the code is lightweight enough that
the function call overhead has a significant impact on performance utility programs – a
utility or software utility is computer system software intended to analyze, configure,
monitor or help maintain a computer typically a utility is smaller than a standard
program in size and may be included with an operating system or installed separately
utility software should be contrasted with application software, which allows users to
do things like creating text documents, playing games, listening to music or surfing the web
rather than providing these kinds of user oriented or output oriented functionality,
utilities software usually focuses on how the computer infrastructure including the computer
the user interface and allows the operating system to interact with the hardware
software is a generic term for an organized collection of computer data and instructions
hardware, operating system, application software, and data storage operates
due to this focus some utilities are rather technical and targeted at people with an advanced
level of computer knowledge others are commonly used by all the users most utilities are highly
specialized and designed to perform only a single task or a small range of task however there are
also some utilities suites that combines several features in one piece of software
most major operating systems come with several pre-installed utilities some of the most popular
utility software are given here, antivirus, file management tools, compression tools,
disk cleanup, disk defragmenter, backup, registry cleaners, and file splitters
antivirus – a virus can be defined as a malicious program that attaches itself to a horse program
and makes multiple copies of itself, slowing down, corrupting or destroying the system a software
some system software is used directly by users and other system software works in the background
that assist the operating system in providing virus-free environment to the user is called
antivirus an antivirus catch the system for any virus and is defected, gets rid of it by deleting
or isolating it it can detect many types of virus like boot virus, trojan, worms, spyware, etcetera
when any external storage devices like usb drive is attached to the system,
antivirus software can set and gives an alert if a virus is detected
we can set up our systems for periodic scans or scan whenever you feel the need
a combination of both the techniques is advisable to keep your system virus free
file management tools – as we know file management is an important function of operating systems
as all data and instructions are stored in the computer in the form of files utility
software providing regular file management tasks like browse, search, update, preview, etcetera
system software can allow users to interact directly with the hardware functionality
are called the file management tools windows explorer in windows operating system,
google desktop, directory opus, double commander etcetera are examples of such tools
compression tools - storage space is always at a premium in computer systems so operating systems
are always looking at ways to minimize the amount of storage space taken by files compression tools
are utilities that assist operating systems in shortening files so that they take less space
after compression files are stored in a different format and cannot be read or edited directly
it needs to be an compressed before it can be assessed for further use
some of the popular compression tools are winrar, peazip and unarchiver, etcetera
disk cleanup - disk cleanup tools assist users in freeing up disk space the software
scans hard disk to find files that are no longer used and free
like the device manager and many of the utilities found in the control panel
subspace by deleting them disk defragmenter – disk defragmenter is a disk management utility
that increases file access speeds by rearranging fragmented fires on continuous location
large files a broken down into fragments and maybe stored in noncontiguous locations if conditionals
ones are not available when such files are accessed by the user, access speed is slow
due to fragmentation disk defragmenter utility scans the hard disk and tries to assemble file
fragments so that they may be stored in contiguous locations backup - backup utility enables
backing up of files, folders, databases, or complete disk backups are taken so that data
may be restored in case of data loss backup is a service provided by all operating systems
in standalone systems backup may be taken in the same or different drive in case of networked
systems backup may be done on backup servers registry cleaners - registry cleaners are programs
the most important feature of the system software include closeness to the system,
that allow for us to scan our computer for any errors in the registry which is a collection of
the code computer files that are essential to perform and functionality and repairs them if
needed registry cleaners are widely available on the internet and give a significant upper
hand when cleaning up the mess, that a virus or the other malware has left on our computer
likewise, some otherwise safe computers can cause errors in the registry without intending to
registry files can also be corrupted if the user unknowingly deletes or modifies a file
in the registry this usually occurs when an inexperienced user tries to fix their computer
and inevitably causes more damage than before file splitters – file splitters are programs that
allow to break a file into smaller pieces in order to store or send files file splitters
often come in handy because many online storage services including email attachments limit us to
fast speed, difficult to manipulate, written in low level language, difficult to design, etcetera
specific file size that can be transferred at one time even though files often exceed these limits
file splitters allow to break the file into two or more pieces, send them simultaneously
and then brings* them back together when we are ready to use the file again
a good file splitter is files splits it allows to break a file if any size into multiple pieces and
then rejoins the files together just as easily software is essential for a computer to work
the computer is a machine that was only according to the given instruction or software
this can be divided into two such as system software, that support the basic functionalities
of a computer system and application software that is used to interact with the system for
specific applications utility software is system software designed to help to analyze,
configure, optimize or maintain a computer it is used to support the computer infrastructure
system software can be categorized under the following operating system- harnesses the
in contrast to application software, which is aim at directly performing task that benefit
ordinary users hence we have discussed language translators,
linkers, loaders and other important system utilities such as antivirus, debuggers, etcetera
hope you enjoyed this session see you next time, until then bye
communication between hardware, system programs and other applications
device driver- enables device communication with operating system and other programs firmware-
enables device control and identification translator- translates high level language
to low-level machine codes utility- ensures optimum functionality of devices and applications
as we have seen earlier there are two types of software, application software
operating system - we have already seen the basic functionalities of an operating system how well
we’ll have a quick look on the important concepts regarding it the operating system is a type of
system software kernel that sits between computer hardware and end-user it is installed first on
a computer to allow devices and applications to be identified and therefore functional
system software is the first layer of software to be loaded into memory every time a computer
is powered up suppose a user wants to write and print a report to an attached printer,
a word processing application is required to accomplish this task
data input is done using a keyboard or other input devices and then displayed on the monitor
the prepared data is then sent to the printer in order for the word processor,
keyboard and printer to accomplish this task they must work with the operating system
and system software application software helps users to solve a particular problem
which controls input and output functions, memory management, and print the spooling
today the user interacts with the operating system through the graphical user interface or gui on a
monitor or touch screen interface the desktop in modern operating systems is a graphical workspace
which contains menus, icons and apps that are manipulated by the user through a mouse
driven cursor or the touch of a finger the disk operating system or dos was a popular
interface used in nineteen eighties types of operating system - real time operating system-
it is installed in special purpose embedded systems like robots cast and modems
single user and single task operating system- these are installed on single user devices like
phones single user and multitask operating system- they are installed on contemporary
personal computers multi-user operating system- it is installed in network environments
or carry out a specific task a word processor is an example of application software
where many users have to share resources server operating systems are examples of multi-user
operating systems network operating systems- it is used to share resources such as files,
printers, etcetera, in a network setup internet web operating system- it is designed
to run on the browser that is online mobile operating system- it is designed to run on
mobile phones, tablets and other mobile devices functions of operating systems-
they provide the interface between the user and hardware through gui manages
and allocate memory space for applications processes the management of applications,
input output devices and instructions configures and manages internal and peripheral devices
manages single or multi-user storage in local and network computers
security management of files and applications detects, installs, and troubleshoots devices
system software coordinates the activities and functions of hardware and software and its
monitors system performance through task manager and other tools
produce error messages and troubleshooting options
implement interface for network communication manages printers in single or multi-user systems
internal on network file management examples of operating system - popular operating systems
for computers are windows ten, mac os x, linux, etcetera
popular network server operating systems are ubuntu server, windows server, red hat enterprise
popular internet of web operating systems are chrome os, club linux, remix os
popular mobile operating systems are iphone os, android os, windows phone os, etcetera
device drivers – driver software is a type of system software which brings computer devices
and peripherals to life drivers make it possible for all connected components
control the operations of computer hardware a computer's operating system is an example of
and external add-ons perform their intended task and as directed by the operating system
without drivers the operating system would not assign any duties examples of devices which
require drivers are mouse, keyboard, sound card, display card, network card, printer,
etcetera usually the operating system ships with drivers for most devices already in the market
by default input devices such as mouse and keyboard will have their drivers installed
they may never require third party installations if a device is newer than the operating system
the user may have to download drivers from manufacturer websites or alternative sources
firmware – firmware is the operational software embedded within a flash rom or eprom memory
chips for the os to identify it it directly manages and controls all activities of any
single hardware traditionally firmware used to mean fixed software as denoted by the word firm
system software operating systems control the computer hardware and act as an interface for
it was installed or nonvolatile chips and could be upgraded only by swapping
them with new pre-programmed chips this was done to differentiate them
from high level software which could be updated without having the swap components today
firmware is stored in flash chips which can be upgraded without swapping semiconductor chips
bios and uefi - the most important firmware in computers today is installed by the manufacturer
on the motherboard and can be accessed through the old bios basic input output system or the new uefi
unified extended firmware interface platforms it is the configuration interface which loads first
when the computer is powered up and is going through post that is power on self-test
the motherboard firmware starts by waking up all the hardware and ensures that components
like the processor, memory, and disk drivers are operational if all the crucial components are
the users the functions of operating system such as process management, memory management,
fine it will run the bootloader which will load the operating system
if the random access memory is faulty, the bios will not allow the computer to boot up the user
can change the bios and uefi settings by pressing special keys a function key, delete, or the escape
key at boot up to load the configuration page the user can configure security, boot order,
time and other options in the page that pops up though they work differently firmware compliments
drivers in a few ways both give identity to hardware devices with the letter making,
the operating system see the device the major difference between the two is that firmware will
always reside within the device while drivers will install within the operating system
firmware upgrades come from the device manufacturer not the operating system
manufacturer they are necessary if the user wants computer hardware to receive
device management and information management, etcetera, were discussed in the previous session
welcome back
they are efficient and economical to use for applications in which activity ratio is high
disadvantages of sequential files- they are inefficient and uneconomical to use for applications
in which activity ratio is low
there use is limited to batch processing environment because of the need to accumulate transactions
in batches
this is to keep the activity ratio high
sequential processing requires extra hour head off sorting the file before using them
for processing that is both transaction and master files must be stored in some sequence
before processing
sequential processing often leads to data redundancy problem because the same data may
even today
be stored in several files sequenced on different keys
indexed files- sequential files are used for storing data that will be processed in the
order in which the entries are stored
this method is inefficient when the records in the file are to be accessed in an unpredictable
order
to identify the location of the required logical record quickly, index is used
such a file system is called indexed file
the index for a file contains a list of keys stored in the file along with the entries
indicating the location of the record containing each key
hence, to find a particular record first identify the index and then retrieve the block of information
data storage, data processing deals with operations on data, these operations are defined on different
stored at the location associated with that key
a files index is normally stored as a separate file on the same secondary storage device
as the indexed file
the index is transferred to the main memory before file processing begins, to easily access
the records in the file whenever necessary
the principle of indexed files is similar to that of the index used in a book or hospital
entry that is the display board at the entrance of the large multi storied building containing
names and room numbers of the <?>occupance</?> is an index that helps to locate a person’s
room within the building or if we want to read about a particular topic in some books
first we will find out that topic in the index of the book to get the page number rather
levels which lead to the data storage hierarchy of data processing
than searching for the topic from page one and check all the pages until we find the
topic
after getting the page number we will directly turn to that page and start reading
in the indexed file organization there are two files such as data file and index file
the data file contains the records stored in the file and index file contains the index
key and disk address of each record stored in the data file
records in the data files can be stored in random sequence
but index keys in the index file are stored as a sorted sequence of index key values
different variations of the basic index concepts are used in the file system
one of these is to construct the index in a hierarchical manner so that it takes the
the six levels used in this hierarchy are depicted in the following figure
form of a layered artery structure
an example is the hierarchical directory system used by many of the operating system for organizing
the file storage
this technique of file management is known as indexed sequential access method or isam
advantages of indexed sequential files- they can be used efficiently for sequential processing
of high activity ratio applications
they can be used efficiently for direct access processing of low activity ratio applications
disadvantages of sequential files- they require relatively expensive hardware and software
resources because they must be stored on a direct access device like disk, they require
more storage space than other types of files because additional space is needed for index files
the bit is the smallest item of data and the combination of multiple related bits is called
when used for direct access online applications, access to records maybe slower than direct files
hashed files- even though indexing provides relatively quick access to entries within
a data storage structure it has the expense of index maintenance
a similar technique with less overhead is known as hashing
like indexed files hashing allows a record to be located with a key value but rather
than looking up the key in an index file hashing identifies the location of the record directly
from the key
in the hash system, the data storage space is divided into several sections called buckets
a bucket is capable of holding several records
the records are dispersed among the buckets according to some algorithm that converts
a character or byte
key value into bucket numbers
this conversion from key values to bucket numbers is called a hash function
each record is store in the bucket identified by this process
thus a record that has been placed in the storage structure can be retrieved by first
applying the hash function to the records identifying key to determine the appropriate
bucket, then retrieve in the condense of that bucket and finally searching through the data
retrieved for the desired record
hashing is a technique used to retrieve the data from both mass storage and main memory
when hashing is applied in mass storage the result is called a hash file
and when applied to a storage structure in main memory the result is called a hash table
a field is a combination of multiple related characters
consider a student file in which each record contains information about a single student,
first we establish several available areas of mass storage that will play the role of buckets
the number and size of buckets are designed decisions
now, assume that we have forty-one buckets refer to as bucket zero, bucket one, etcetera
bucket forty
suppose, student register number is used as the key for identifying student’s record,
we have to develop a hash function for converting these keys into bucket numbers
one of the simplest functions is to divide the key by the number of buckets available
and record the remainder, in this case a number between zero and forty
thus, the remainder of the division identifies one of these forty-one buckets
it is a meaningful collection of related characters and is the smallest logical data entity treated
after that if we need to retrieve a record just apply the hash function to the <?>records
key</?> to identify the bucket and then search the bucket for the required record
although hashing function is designed to generate a unique address for each record key value,
in practice, it sometimes maps the key value of two or more records to same storage address
this phenomenon is called collision
to control the collision one method is to use a pointer at the address calculated by
the hashing function
this pointer points to a linked list of addresses containing physical addresses of all records
whose key value is map to the address calculated by the hashing function
to obtain an efficient hash system the records being stored should be distributed evenly
as a single unit in data processing
among the buckets
if a disproportionate number of keys happen to hash to the same bucket, then a disproportionate
number of records will be stored in a single bucket
this is called clustering and it causes the loss of any benefits gained by hashing
in order to reduce the chance of clustering the storage area can be divided into any prime
number of buckets because prime number eliminates the possibility of common factors
suppose that we have found a hash function that arbitrarily distributes records among
forty-one buckets and we are going to insert new records one at a time
when the first record is inserted that will be inserted into an empty bucket
when we insert the next record only forty of the forty-one buckets are empty, so the
a combination of different related fields is referred to as a record
in this module we are going to see the file structures
probability that the second record will be placed in an empty bucket is only forty by
forty-one
assuming that the second record is placed in an empty bucket, the probability for the
third record to be placed in an empty bucket is thirty-nine by forty-one
the probability that all the first eight records will be placed in empty buckets, is forty-one
by forty-one into forty by forty-one into thirty-nine by forty-one, etcetera into thirty-four
by forty-one which is equal to zero point four eight two
that is, it is more likely than not that in distributing records among forty-one buckets
a collision will have occurred by the time the eighth record is store
the high probability of collision indicates that regardless of how well chosen a hash
multiple records are combined to form a file, each record in a file is identified by a key
function might be there is a chance for clustering
it is possible that a bucket might fill up and over flow
one solution to this problem is to allow the buckets to expand in size
and other approach is to allow buckets to spill into an over flow area that has been
reserved for that purpose
the occurrence of clustering an overflowing buckets can degrade the performance of a hash file
research shows that, hash file perform well as long as the ratio of the number of records
to the total record capacity of the file called the load factor remains below fifty percent
thus a hash storage system is usually reconstructed with a larger capacity if its load factor
approaches the seventy-five percentage value
field which contains unique values for every record in the field
advantages of hash files- given the key, any record can be quickly located and retrieved directly
it does not require transactions to be stored in sequence before processing
it does not require accumulation of transactions in batches before processing them
they are processed whenever generated
it can support interactive online applications needed to provide up to the minute information
in response to inquiries from user
if required, it is also possible to process direct file records sequentially
disadvantages of hash files- they require relatively expensive hardware and software
resources because they must be stored on a direct access storage device such as disk
due to address generation overhead involved they are less efficient and economical than
a database is an integration of multiple
sequential files for use in sequential application with high activity ratio
they often require special security and access synchronization mechanisms because online
direct files are generally made accessible simultaneously from multiple online stations
the role of the operating system- from the user point of view the most important aspect
of a file system is the appearance of the files such as the contents, name, protection
mechanisms and operations possible on files
but the files are actually managed by the operating system
the structure, naming, access, use, protection and implementation are done by the operating
system
the part of the operating system dealing with files is known as file system
related files in databases redundancy is reduced
implementing files- the main issue in the implementation of the file storage is keeping
track off which disk block go with which file
some methods used in different systems are contiguous allocation, linked allocation and
i-node
contiguous allocation- in this scheme each file is stored as a contiguous block of data
on the disk
the advantages of this method are to keep track a file’s blocks only the address of
the first block need to be remembered and the entire file can be read from the disk
in a single operation
but the difficulties with the allocation are, it is not feasible if the maximum file size
it is a collection of logically related data elements for multiple files
is not known at the time the file is created and the wastage of disk space
linked list allocation- in other method for storing files is to keep each one as a linked
list of disk blocks
the first word of each block is used as a pointer to the next one, the remaining block
is for data
unlike contiguous allocation no space is lost to disk fragmentation and every block can
be used in this method
the directory entry needs to store only the disk address of the first block
the amount of data storage in a block is no longer a power of two because the pointer
takes up some bytes and random access is a slower process
file oriented approach, in this approach an applications data is organized into one or
but the disadvantages of linked list allocation can be eliminated by taking the pointer block
from each disk block and keeping it in a table or index in memory
using this organization, the entire block is available for data
it makes the random access much easier
the disadvantage of this method is that the entire table must be in memory all the time
i-node, the next method for keeping track of which blocks belong to which file is to
keep with each file a small table called i-node or index node, which list the attributes and
disk addresses of the files blocks
hence, the operating system has an important role in the creation, opening, closing and
accessing of files and directories
more files and the application program processes the data stored in these files to generate
in this module an introduction to the file oriented approach of data storage is given
it presents an idea about the various elements of a data storage hierarchy and then discusses
the various types of files
sequential file stores and accesses the records in a serial order while the indexed files
use the help of index to locate a particular file
hash system uses an algorithm to map the records to storage locations with reduced number of
collision and clustering
this module also gives some details about the role of operating system in creating and
maintaining files in the system
it uses a set of programs called file management system or fms for this purpose
decided output
this module concludes by referring to the various methods of implementing files in a
computer system with the help of the operating system
before we conclude please try to answer the following questions, explain the data storage
hierarchy
what is meant by the file oriented approach?
what are the different types of files supported by the file management system? briefly explain
the sequential file structure
list out the merits and demerits of indexed files
explain the technique used in hash file system
what is the importance of operating system in file management?
a master file of permanent data and transaction files of temporary data are used here

hope you enjoyed this session, see you next time, until then bye
for example, in a payroll application master file contains all permanent details of each
today technology is enhanced to store huge amounts of data but traditional file structures
employee such as name, address, code, pay-rate, tax-paid-to-date, total gross-pay to date,
income tax rate, etcetera
transaction payroll file contains details of hours work this month, normal working hours,
over time hours, quantity of goods made, etcetera
both of these files are used to generate this month’s pay slips and the master file will be updated
file management system, in a file oriented approach a set of programs called file management
system or fms provides facilities to organize, create, delete, update and manipulate the files
a file management system typically supports different types of files such as transaction
file, master file, output file, report file and the backup file, etcetera
we will see each one of these
provide many tools which are used as the base for today’s database and the data mining systems
transaction files- a transaction file stores input data temporarily until it can be processed
master file- a master file contains all current data relevant to an application
the data stored in it are of more permanent nature
output file- some applications use multiple programs for data processing
in such applications, output of one program maybe the input of another program
thus outputs generated intermediately must be stored and output files are used for this purpose
this output file is accessed by the latter program in the application
report file- the report file is used to hold a copy of the report whenever desired
report file has advantages over paper documents because files are easier to store and carry
backup file- it is a copy of a file, used as a precaution against loss of data due to
the principles of these traditional files structures are discussed here in detail
corruption or accidental deletion of original file
back up files should be created regularly
sequential files- a sequential file is a type of file that is accessed in sequential order
or in serial order from the beginning to the end
the information in the file is arranged in a long row, audio files, video files, files
containing programs are examples for sequential files
most of the files created by a typical personal computer user are sequential files
text files are sequential files in which each logical record is a single symbol encoded
using ascii or uni-code
the only requirement to construct and elaborate sequential file is to establish a uniform
these structures actually represent the historical beginning of data storage and retrieval systems
format for representing the information about each entity as a string of text
then the information is enclosed according to that format and then stores the resulting
records one after the other as one single string of
text for example, a student file can be constructed by agreeing to end* each student record as
a string of thirty one characters consisting of a field of twenty characters for name followed
by the a field of six characters to represent the student register number followed by a
field of two characters to represent the grade and three characters to represent the rank
the final file would be a long string of encoded characters in which each thirty-one character
block represents the information about a single student
information would be retrieved from the file in terms logical records consisting of thirty-one
from which current database technology has evolved
character blocks
within each of these blocks individual fields would be identified according to the uniform
format with which the blocks were constructed
file consisting of a sequence of blocks each containing thirty-one characters is given
in the figure
the data in a sequential files must be recorded in mass storage in such a way that the sequential
nature of the file is preserved
if the storage system is itself sequential like tapes we need to record the file on the
storage medium according to the sequential properties of the medium
processing the file is the task of merely reading and processing the files contents
many of the techniques developed for these structures like indexing and hashing are used
in the order in which they are found
in the case of disk storage, the file would be scattered over different sectors that could
be retrieved in a variety of orders
to preserve the sequential order the file manager of the operating system maintains
a list of sectors on which the file is stored
the list is stored as a part of the disk directory system
hence with the help of this list the operating system can retrieve the sectors in the proper
sequence as though the file will store sequentially
while processing a sequential file, it is necessary to detect the end of the file is
reached
as the important tools in the construction of today’s large complex databases
the end of a sequential file is marked as end of file or eof
there are different methods for identifying the end of file
one method is to place a special record called <?>sentinel</?> at the end of the file
and the other method is to use the information in the operating system’s directory system
to identify the eof
since the operating system knows which sectors contain the file it also knows where the file
terminates, an example involving sequential files is payroll processing
advantages of sequential files- they are simple to understand and use
they are easy to organize and maintain
they need relatively inexpensive io media and devices for their storage and processing
however, some applications dealing with simple and small data sets are file oriented approaches
the objectives of this module are to get an understanding of the database oriented approach
data and a set of programs to access those data
the collection of data is referred by the name database
the goal of a dbms is to provide an environment that is both convenient and efficient to use
the data base management system is the major software component of a database system
ingres, oracle, sybase, etcetera are some commercially available dbms
it is a combination of software and hardware that can be used to set up and monitor the
database and can also be used for the updating and retrieval of database which is stored in it
the capabilities of a dbms include creation, addition, deletion and modification of files
and data
retrieving data collectively or
and saving accounts along with other data
with mathematical functions and maintenance of data integrity, create an environment for
data mining and data warehousing
a dbms is served as an interface between the user and databases, when the user request
to retrieve the information from a database, the dbms of that database processes this request
and presents the required information to the user
the dbms can be accessed directly from a terminal or can be coded as high level language programs
a query is often the request to the dbms and its responds to a query by invoking the appropriate
subprograms to execute its function to interpret the query
as said before, the database consist of a collection of a related files of different
if this information are stored as operating system files to allow users to manipulate
types of records and the dbms helps the users to access the data without giving in background
details, such as the location of the database and the organization of them
the role of a dbms can be compared to that of a sales person
a customer specifies the items he wants to the sales person at the counter
the sales person retrieves the items from the store and presents it to the customer
customer does not have any idea about where these items are stored and how they are actually
organized in the store
he simply selects the desired items from an alphabetical list and places the order but
the logical order in the list may not have in a relationship with the actual arrangement
of the goods in the store
the information the system has a number of application programs like programs to debit
likewise, a user needs to know only what data he requires, the remaining part is done by
the dbms
all the data items about which information is stored in the database are called entities
the characteristics of entities are called attributes
these attributes can have simple values like number or text or a picture or some sequence
of sound
the association among entities in the database is called relationships
one of the key features of the database approach is the distinction between the logical structure
and physical structure of data
logical structure refers to the way in which the programmer sees it and the physical structure
or credit an account, add a new account, find the balance of an account, generate monthly
refers to the way data are actually residing in the storage medium
advantages of dbms- reduction of redundancies, centralized control of data avoids duplication
of data and hence reduces the amount of storage space required
if there are any redundancies exist in the dbms they will be controlled and ensures that
these copies are consistent
sharing data- dbms allows the sharing of data among any number of application programs under
some controlled environment
data integrity- centralized control also ensures the necessary checks in the dbms to provide
data integrity which means that the data in the database are accurate and consistent
data security- for an organization the data is important, unauthorized access is denied
statement, etcetera
for the database by implementing proper access procedures and proper authentication schemes
within the dbms
different views of the same database also ensure that unauthorized persons will not
access the confidential data
resolution of conflicts- database administrator controls the entire database the dba resolves
the conflicting requirements by selecting the best file structure and access
methods to get optimal performance
data independence- data independence is of two types, such as physical data independence
and logical data independence
physical data independence allows changes in physical organization without requiring
new application programs are added to the system as in when needed
changes in the external view or conceptual view
thus, files can be moved from one physical media to another without affecting the application
programs using this database
logical data independence implies that the conceptual schema can be changed without effecting
the existing external schema, that is if fields are added to records or deleted from records
the application programs need not be changed
this data independence is similar to the concept of abstract data types in modern programming languages
both will hide the implementation details from the user
disadvantages of dbms- the dbms is expensive, it is very costly to develop or purchase the
software, it requires the hardware and workspace to be upgraded
as a result, the system acquires more files and more application programs
the processing overhead which involves the mechanisms to implement integration, security
and sharing will degrade the response and throughput times
the lack of duplication requires the database to be backed up frequently to recover the
data in the case of system failure
the centralization and security measurements violate the interrupt and operation of the
organization because of the downtimes and failures
database languages- a database system provides different types of languages to work with
the databases
a data definition language or ddl is used to specify the database schema
and the data manipulation language or dml is used to expressed the database queries
this typical file processing system is supported by a conventional operating system
and updates
these two languages are parts of a single database language such as sql languages
data definition language- the data definition language is used to specify the database schema
and additional properties of the data, the storage structure and access methods are specified
by a type of ddl called the data storage and definition language
these statements define the implementation details that are hidden from the users
this definition includes all the entities sets, their attributes and the relationships
among these entities
this definition also include, the constrains that have to be maintained while updating
the database
the system stores permanent records in various files and different application programs need
the integrity constrains associated with the database system that can be tested with minimal
overhead include domain constrains, referential integrity constrains, assertions and authorization
the output of the ddl is placed in the data dictionary containing metadata
the data about data in the database is referred to as metadata
the data dictionary is in the form of a table that can be accessed and updated only by the
database system itself before reading and modifying actual data
data manipulation language- the manipulation language enables the users to access or manipulate
data as organized by the specified data model
the different types of accesses are insertion of new data, retrieval of information stored
in the database, deletion of data from the data base and modification of the data stored
to extract and add records to files
to learn about the drawbacks of traditional file oriented approach
in the database
there are mainly two types of dml such as procedural dmls and declarative dmls
procedural dmls requires a user to specify what data needed and how to get those data,
declarative dmls or non-procedural dmls require a user to specify what data are needed without
specifying how to get those data
a query is a request to retrieve the information, the part of the dml that involves information
retrieval is called a query language
the query processor component of the database system translates dml queries into sequence
of actions at the physical level of the database systems
database architecture- database management systems are complex softwares which were developed
keeping organizational information in a file processing system has a number of disadvantages
and optimized over years
from a user’s view point most of them have a similar architecture but the internal structure
of the system varies a lot
the architecture of a database system is highly depended on the underlying computer system
on which the database system runs
the database system can be centralized or client server or distributor
database systems are generally partitioned into two or three parts
in a two tier architecture the application is partitioned into a component that resides*
at the climb machine, this will invoke database system functionality at the server machine
with query language systems
such as, data redundancy and inconsistency, accessing difficulty, data isolation, integrity
application program interface standards like odbc and jdbc are used for interaction between
the client and the server
in a three tier architecture, the climb machine acts as <?>19 - 06</?> and does not contain
any direct database calls
the client <?>end</?> communicates with an application server commonly through a form
interface
the application server then communicates with the database system to access data
for large applications and for applications that run on the world wide web three-tier
architecture is more appropriate
the difference between a three-tier architecture and a two-tier architecture can clearly be
problems, atomicity problems, concurrent access anomalies and security and flexibility problems
identified with the help of the following figure
database users- the people who work with databases are categorized mainly into database system users
and database administrators, we will see them in detail
according to the way of interaction with the system there are four types of database users
different types of user interfaces have been designed for the different types of users,
they are native users, application programmers, sophisticated users and specialized users
native users, they are unsophisticated users who interact with the system by invoking one
of the application programs that have already been written
the typical user interface for the native users is forms in which the user can fill
in the appropriate fields to specify the required data, these type of users just read the reports
these difficulties paved the way for database systems
generated from the database
application programmers- the computer professionals who develop application programs come under
this category
they are free to choose any tools to develop the application or user interfaces
rapid application development or rad tools help the application programmers to write
forms and reports with less programming effort
sophisticated users- these types of users interact directly with the system without
writing programs
they use query languages to specify the queries and then submits this to a query processor
specialized users- the sophisticated users who write specialized database applications
database oriented approach, a database is a system that converts a large collection
rather than traditional data processing are called specialized users
the cad systems, knowledge based and expert systems, environment modeling systems, etcetera
are specialized applications whose data sets are of complex types
the other category is database administrator or dba
we know that one of the important reasons for using dbms is the central control of data
and programs
a person having a central control of the system is called the dba or database administrator
the main functions of the dba are schema definition, storage structure and access method definition,
modification of schema and physical organization, authority of giving permission for data access,
routine maintenance such as backing up the database, disk space management and monitoring
of data into an abstract tool allowing the users to search for an extract <?>pertain</?>
of running jobs
now, we will summarize what we have discussed
here an introduction to the database oriented approach is given
the module starts with a reference to the significant drawbacks of traditional file
systems then it goes through database oriented approach and defines the terms schema and
subschema
different level of abstraction in the database such as physical level, logical level and
view level are discussed in detail
the concept of dbms such as data abstraction, database languages and database structure
are briefly discussed
items of information in a manner that is convenient to the user
the module ends by giving an account of various database users and dba
before we conclude please try to answer the following questions
explain the function of a dba?
write a note on database architecture
explain ddl and dml?
what are the limitations of traditional file systems?
what is meant by dbms?
explain the features
what is meant by schema?

structures for storage of information and providing mechanisms for the manipulation
of information
to know about the various terms associated with databases
it should also ensure the safety of the information stored from system crashes or unauthorized access
information is important as far as the organization is concern
hence, a large number of concepts and techniques are developed for managing data
nowadays databases are widely used
some important applications are for reservation and scheduling information of airlines, to
manage the student information in universities
banking information management, in telecommunication to keep the call records, to generate monthly
bills and to store the communication network information
in finance for storing information about holding, sales and purchases of financial instruments
such as bonds and stocks
to learn about the various database languages
in human resource management to keep the information about employees, salaries, payroll, taxes, etcetera
the increased use of internet increased the direct user access to databases
many of the organizations converted their phone interfaces to web interfaces and made
a variety of services and information available online
even though user interfaces hide details of access to a database and the people are not
aware of their dealing with a database, accessing database forms and essential part of day to
day life of almost everyone
oracle a database system vendor is one of the largest software companies in the world
today which shows the importance of database systems now
schemas, historically computers were used in information management with large collection
to understand the different types of uses
of data
if the different but related items were restored in separate systems, much of the information
required by an organization was duplicated throughout the company
the database systems emerged to integrate the information stored by a particular organization
but the data integration has the disadvantages like sensitive data may be accessed by an
unauthorized user, etcetera
hence, control to access the information as well as the sharing information in the database
is important
to provide different uses different information within the same database, database system
uses schemas and subschemas
the term database refers to a collection of data that is multidimensional in the sense
a schema defines the overall design whereas a subschema defines only a portion of the
database specifying a particular users needs
the collection of information stored in the database at a particular time is called an
instance of the database
the overall design of the database is called database schema
database systems have several schemas according to the level of abstraction
the physical schema describes the database design at the physical level
the logical schema describes the database design at the logical level and the subschema
describes the different views of the database
the logical schema is the important of these three because the programmers develop applications
that internal links between its entries make the information accessible from a variety
by using the logical schema
the physical schema is lying under the logical schema and hence not much affects the application program
data abstraction, a database system is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs
that allow users to access and modify this data
the database system provides users only an abstract view of data by hiding the inner
complexities of storing and maintaining it
there are different levels of abstraction as far as the users of the database systems
are concerned
physical level- this is the lowest level of abstraction and describes how the data are
actually stored
of perspective
it describes the details of low level data structure
logical level- the next higher level of abstraction is at logical level
it describes what data are stored in the database and what the relationships among those data are database
administrators use the logical level of abstraction because they decide what information
to keep in the database
view level- the highest level of abstraction is possible in view level
the view level describes only a part of the entire database
this level is provided to simplify the interactions with the system
the same database can be viewed in different ways
at the physical level a student record can be described as a block of consecutive storage locations
database systems arose in response to early methods of computerized management of commercial data
like bytes or <?>words</?>
these details are hidden from the programmers, the physical organization of the database
maybe not only to the administrators
at the logical level each such record is described by a type of definition and the relationship
maybe defined
in the view level, computer users see a set of application programs in which the details
of data types are hidden
the views also provide a security mechanism to prevent users from accessing certain parts
of the database
database management system- a database management system or dbms is a collection of interrelated
for example, consider a part of a bank enterprise that keeps information about all customers
welcome back, in this module we are going to discuss database management system implementation
hence the structure of a network database is extremely complicated in which one record
can be used as a key of the entire database
it is structured in the form of a graph and high level language such as pascal, cobol,
etcetera, were used to implement the records and to set structures
hierarchical data model, in a hierarchical dbms the relationships among data in the database
are established in such a way that one data item is present as the sub ordinate of another one
this will have parent child relationship among them
tree is used to structure this type of database and backward moment is not possible in the
hierarchical database
all the dbms such as dbase, foxpro, etcetera, are hierarchical and not used nowadays
in the early two thousand, the xml and the associated query language xquery were emerged
relational model, a dbms is said to be a relational dbms or rdbms if the database relationships
are treated in the form of a table
the main keys of relational dbms are relation, domain and attributes
the relational model uses a collection of table to represent both data and relationships
among those data
it is the most widely used data model and a majority of the current database systems
are based on the relational model
some examples are oracle, sybase, ingres, microsoft sql server, microsoft access, etcetera
entity-relationship model, it is based on a perception of a real word consisting of
a collection of basic objects called entities and relationship among these entities
as new database technologies
object based data model, the object based model can be considered as an extension of
the entity relationship model
the term object oriented database system is used to refer database systems that support
an object based type system and allow direct access to data from an object oriented programming
language using the native type system of the language
semi structured data model, the semi structured data model permits the specification of data
where individual data items of the same type may have different sets of attributes
the extensible markup language or xml is widely used to represent semi structured data
the relational model, in this section the relational database model is explained in detail
it shows data as being stored in rectangular table called relations like those in spreadsheet applications
to minimize the system administration efforts, autonomic computers or auto admin techniques
a row in a relation is called a tuple, some say it is tuple or some other as tuple
tuple consist of information about a particular entity
columns in a relation are called attributes because each entry in a column describes some
characteristics or attributes of the entity represented by the corresponding tuple
issues of relational design, the first step in designing a relational database is to design
the relations making up the database
the typical employee information would consist of emp id, name, address, and social security number
suppose we need to contain information about jobs of the employees
a job history also should be added consisting of attributes, job title, job identification
code, skill code associated with each job, the department, starting date and termination
were evolved
date of the job, etcetera
the simplest approach is to extend the relation given earlier to include these additional
attributes as given here
but this method has several problems, this may contain redundant values, the relation
may no longer contain one tuple for each employee but one tuple for each job assignment of an employee
multiple jobs were assigned to one employee several tuples in new relation must contain
the same information about the employee such as name, address, id and social security number
for example, in the given relation the personal information about nehal and smita is repeated
because they have held more than one job
when a particular position has been held by numerous employees, the department associated
hence in this module we will have a look at the implementation details of a dbms along
with that job along with the appropriate skill code must be repeated in each tuple representing
an assignment of the job
but the serious problem with the new extended relation is when we delete any information
from the database
for example, nehal is the only employee to hold the job identified as d seven
if he left the company and was deleted from the database
we may lose the information about the job d seven
if we can partially erase the tuple, this problem can be solved
but this may introduce more severe problems
the reason for all these problems is that here we have combined more than one concept
with the merits and demerits of the relational model
in a single relation
we can say that the extended relation given here consist of personal information of the
employees, information about the jobs available in the company and information regarding the
relationships between employees and jobs
hence this problem can be solved by redesigning the database system using three relations
one relation is the employee relation which is same as our first relation consisting of
personal details of the employees
another is the job relation consisting of the information about the available jobs in
the company
yet another relation can be designed to keep the relationship between employees and job
layered approach to database implementation, a typical database application involves two
with an assignment relation
the three relations will jointly produce all the information contained in the extended relation
the employee database consisting of these three relations is depicted in the figure
if we know the employee’s identification number, the department in which employee has
worked can be found by first finding all the jobs that employee has held using the job
assignment relation and then finding the departments associated with those jobs with the help of
job relation
even though we solved the problem very easily it has some troubles in dividing information
into various relations
sometimes dividing information into smaller relations causes the loss of information and
software layers such as an application layer and a database management layer as shown here
sometimes it does not
these are known as lossy decomposition and lossless decomposition or non-lossy decomposition respectively
these are the important characteristics while designing a database
relational operations, to understand the basics of data organization and relational model
first we need to have a clear knowledge about how information can be extracted from a database
consisting of relations
the fundamental operations of relational algebra are categorized as unary and binary
select, project and rename operations are called unary operations and union, difference,
cartesian product, join, etcetera, are called binary operations
there are also some other operations such as aggregate operations, self-intersection
the application software manages the communication with the user of the database or some other software
assignment, etcetera
we will now examine the important of these such as select, project and join
the select operation, the select operation selects tuples that satisfy a given predicate
for example, if we want to select the tuple with the appropriate identification attribute
value from the employee relation or to obtain a list of the job titles in a certain department,
we must select the tuples from the job relation having that department as their department
attribute
to express this operation the syntax used is new becomes select from employee where
emp id equals “two four b four one”
this statement implies that a new relation called a new is created which contain those
anyway the application software determines the systems external characteristics
the way of data processing helped a lot for the development or the growth of computers
tuples from the relation employee whose emp id attribute has value equal to “two four
b four one”
the select operation results as given below
the comparisons using equal to, not equal to, less than, less than or equal to, greater
than, greater than or equal to are allowed in the selection predicate
in a sense the select operation extract the rows from a relation which satisfies a specified
predicate or condition
the project operation, the project operation returns its argument relation with certain
attributes left out
a relation is a set and hence the duplicate rows are eliminated
the communication with the user may be in text based format or a graphical user interface
in contrast to the select operation, the project operation extracts columns from a relation
for example, we want to get the job titles in a certain company, we can get it by retrieving
the information of job title column in the jobs relation
the project operation allows extracting this column and placing the result in a new relation,
it can be expressed as new two becomes project job title from jobs
the result is the creation of a new relation called new two that contains a single column
of values from the job title column of jobs relation
the project operation can also be used to extract a list of columns by listing the columns
in the project operation
for example, new relation becomes project name, address from employee can be used to
or gui
get a listing of the names and address of all employees
the join operation, another operation used in conjunction with relational databases is
the join operation
this can be used to combine different relations into one relation
the join produces a new relation whose attribute consist of the attributes from the original
relation
the names of these attributes are the same as those in the original relation with a prefix
to indicate the original relation
that is if a relation a containing attributes p and q is joined with a relation b containing
attributes x, y and z, the resultant relation will be having five attributes called a dot
the application software determines what action the user is requesting and then uses the database
p, a dot q, b dot x, b dot y and b dot z
this property ensures that the attributes in the new relation have unique names even
though the original relations might contain same attributes names
sql, the database are generally stored in mass storage system
in order to relieve the application programmer from the details of these systems as database
management system based on some data model is provided
the dbms accepts commands in terms of the model and converts them into actions relative
to the actual storage structure
thus a dbms based on the relational model should be able perform the relational operations
such as select, project and join
management system or the dbms to achieve the results
these are called from the application program
today’s relational dbms provide routines better combinations of the select, project
and join
the <?>19 - 57*</?> has standardizes the sql and it is the underlying language of the database
system my sql
sql needs only a description about the required information, the algorithms for the manipulation
of relations will be developed by the dbms
the sql has several parts called data definition language or ddl, data manipulation language
or dml and data control language or dcl
the sql consist of statements for defining the structure of relations, creating relations,
it will not directly manipulate the database
modifying the contents of relations and performing queries
for example, select emp id, department from job assignment, job where assignment dot job
id equal to job dot job id and assignment dot term date equal to star
in this sql queries statement there are three closures such as, a select, a from and the
<?>under where class</?>
it is a request for the result of forming the joint of all the relations listed in from
the <?>class</?> selecting those tuples that satisfy the condition in the <?>where class</?>
and then projecting the tuples listed in the select <?>class</?>
now, we can summarize the session
in this module a database system based on the relational model is given with it features
if the user requests the application software to add or delete data, the dbms actually alters
and issues of design
this module also provides a brief description about the layered approach of database and
the distributed database
in this module we have covered the basic relational operations such as select, project and join
the module concludes by referring to a query language called structured query language
which is a popular language used with most of the relational dbms
before we move to the next session please try to answer the following questions
write a note on dbms
how does the relational model provide for data independence?
briefly explain the issues of relational design
the database
what is meant by sql?
what is the significance of sql in relational dbms?

hope you enjoyed the session, see you next time until then good bye
this distinction has several advantages
it allows the construction and use of abstract tools which is needed to simplify the software
designed process
into a form which it possesses now
since the actual organization of the database is concerned by dbms alone application software
can be simplified
even if the database is stored on a single machine or distributed among many machines
it is not necessary for application software to take care off
another advantage of separating the application software from the dbms is that an organization
provides a means for controlling access to the database
the database management system can enforce the restriction imposed by the various sub
schemas and it can be use the entire database schema for its internal needs
yet in other advantage of the separated layers is to achieve data independence
as we have already discussed, data independence is the ability to change the organization
during nineteen sixties and seventies the scenario of data processing had a significant
of the database without changing application software
suppose the personal department need to add an additional field to employee record those
changes may require modification to the application programs if the database are directly associated
with application software
the separation between the application software and the dbms removes the need for such modification
or reprograming to implement a change in the database required by the personal department
one needs to change the overall schema and the sub schema of those users involved in
the change
the sub schemas of all other users remain the same and hence the application software
of unaltered sub schemas does not need to be modified
change in such a way that the programmers could use data structures such as list entries
usually the application software acts as the client and the database management layer plays
the role of a server
distributed databases, with the advancement of networking capabilities database system
have improved to some distributed ones
in these systems data resides on different machines
a distributed database might contain fragmented or replicated data, in parallel systems the
processes are tightly coupled and constitute a single database system but in distributed
systems the sites that share no physical components are loosely coupled
the distributed database can be classified as either homogeneous or heterogeneous
in a homogeneous distributed database system all sites have identical database management
to free the data from the domination of sequential techniques
system software they were aware of one another and agree to cooperate in processing users
request
in a heterogeneous distributed database, different sites may use different schemas, and different
database management system software
the sites may not be aware of one another and may provide only limited facilities for
cooperation in transaction processing
as mentioned earlier the two approaches to store a relation are in the distributed database
are replication and fragmentation
in replication the system maintains several identical copies or replicas of the relation
and stores each replica at a different site
by that time the relational models and non-procedural <?>queering</?> were defined by code which
in fragmentation the system partitions the relation into several fragments and stores
each fragment at a different site
in the distributed database system each site maintains a local database system
each site is able to process local transaction which access data in only that single site
a site may also participate in the execution of global transaction which access data in
several sites
in the distributed database system, each site maintains a local database system
each site is able to process local transactions which access data in only that single site
a site may also participate in the execution of global transactions which access data in
several sites
helps to hide the implementation details absolutely from programmers
for the successful execution of global transaction communication among the sites is required
a distributed system may suffer from a large number of failures
the failure of a site, the failure of a link, loss of a message and network are some of
the additional issues to be dealt than that of centralized system
database models, the conceptual view of the database is called database model
the routines require to translate commands stated in terms of a conceptual view of the
database into actions required by the actual data storage system are contain within a dbms
the search for better database model is an ongoing process
these researchers are aim at finding models that allow complex data system to be conceptualizing
easily and to produce efficient database management systems
by nineteen eighties heavy researchers were carried out on parallel and distributed databases
the collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics and
consistency constraints are contained within the data models
the data models provide the way to describe the design of a database at the view, logical
and physical levels
the data models can be classified as network data model, hierarchical data model, relational
data model, the entity-relationship model, object based data model and semi structured
data model, etcetera
now, we’ll see each one of these
network data model, a dbms is said to be network dbms if the relationships among the data in
the database are of type many to many
along with the introduction of object oriented databases
welcome friends, in this module we will see object oriented database
objects have a many to many relationship and are accessed with help of pointers
pointers are linked to objects to establish relationships
another benefit of an odbms is that it can be programmed with small procedural changes
without affecting the entire system
this feature helps those organizations which have data relationships that are not entirely
clear or need to change these relations to satisfy the new business requirements
the object oriented approach to the design of the database allows the entire software
system to be designed in the same paradigm
the historical approach is to use an imperative programming language to develop application
software for relational database
an object from employee class contain entries such as start date and term date
an object oriented database combine with an object oriented application program produces
a homogenous image of objects communicating with each other throughout the system
but a relational database combine with an imperative application program provides an
image to inherently different organization trying to find a common interface
another thing for comparison is the relational counter parts of the database
while storing names in an employee database, if the entire name is stored as a single attribute
in a relation then enquiries regarding only last names are not so appreciable
but if the name is stored as three stored separate attributes such as first name, middle
name and last name then it is difficult to deal with people whose names do not confirm
to the first name, middle name and the last name template
the object oriented database, a conceptual representation of the above mentioned database
in object oriented database these difficulties can be solved easily
an employee name can be stored as an intelligent object that is capable of reporting the related
employees name in a variety of formats
hence, from outside these objects it would be just easy to deal with last names only
as with entire names
the details involved with each perspective would be encapsulated within the object
in a relational database the attributes in a relation are part of the overall design
of the database
so, the types associated with these attributes flow to the entire dbms
thus, extending the relational database to include attributes of new types may lead to
is shown in the figure
a problematic situation
but in an object oriented design the procedure can be used with different objects because
the distinction in types can be hidden
another advantage of the object oriented paradigm is the potential for storing intelligent objects
rather than merely data
an object can contain methods describing how it should respond to messages regarding its
contents and relationships
this ability to construct databases whose components respond intelligently to inquiries
offers a large number of possibilities than that of relational databases
the advantages and disadvantages of an object oriented database in view of the relational
here the links between the various objects are shown by lines connecting the related objects
database can be listed as follows
advantages, objects don’t require execution time to assemble or disassemble objects
reduced paging, easier navigation, better concurrency control, data model is based on
the real world, works well for distributed architectures, less code required when applications
are object oriented
disadvantages, lower efficiency when data is simple and relationships are simple
relational tables are simpler
late binding may slow access speed
more user tools exist for rdbms
standards for rdbms are more stable
these links are stored and maintained by the dbms, so the programmer who writes application
support for rdbms is more certain and change is less likely to be required
the object oriented database query, object oriented databases use query language like
sql to express the queries which is called as object query language or oql
oql supports all the mandatory features or characteristics of odbms to make efficient
object database systems
its supports more complex data objects, path expressions, operation invocation, inheritance,
object extensions for object identity, etcetera
oql is a very efficient way of expressing object queries, it keeps objects integrity
by using implemented methods rather than its on operations
oql can also be embedded in other languages like c plus plus and java
software is free of considering the implementation details of these links
oql can be defined as a functional or expression-oriented language, in which each query is a typed expression
type can be atomic object, collection object or literal
oql doesn’t have explicit update operations like insert, delete, update database but as
an alternative it can invoke state altering methods create, add and delete, etcetera to
get similar functions
for example, employee name sanjana, birth data ten nine nineteen eighty-five, salary
twenty-five thousand creates a new employee object with necessary attributes data
like sql we can write separate functions to perform certain task
polymorphism, oql supports the polymorphism feature of the object oriented programming paradigm
the various classes can have same attributes and method implementations which are in same hierarchy
when a new object is added to the database the application software merely specifies
for example, the employee class has attribute named activities, implemented as an array
of strings, its subclass manager also has a method named activities, that overwrites
inheritance of the employee attribute
maintaining database integrity, the database management systems for personal use are inexpensive
and simple systems
they hide the implementation details of the system from the users
when a problem arises the user can correct it directly or reload the database from a
backup copy and manually make up the modifications
this might be an inconvenient process and is restricted to only a few people
in case of large multiuser commercial database systems, the cost of incorrect or lose data
the other objects to which it should be linked
can be enormous and can have unpredictable consequences
hence an important role of the dbms is to maintain the databases integrity by securing
against problem such as partially completed operations or operations producing inaccurate
information in the database
next we will this function of the dbms
the commit rollback protocol, a single transaction such as fund transfer from one bank to another,
registration of a student to some university course, etcetera may have multiple steps at
the database level
for example, the fund transfer needs balance in one bank account to be decremented and
the balance in the other account to be incremented accordingly
the object oriented dbms should also provide permanent storage for the objects entrusted
between these steps, the information in the database is inconsistent that is the funds
are missing during the short period after the first account is decremented but before
the second is incremented
in the case of large databases involving heavy transaction loads we can find the database
in the middle of some transaction
a request for the execution of a transaction or an equipment failure may occur at a time,
when the database is an inconsistent state
the goal of the dbms is not to freeze the database in an inconsistent state
this is accomplished generally by maintaining a list, generally called log containing a
record of each transactions activities in a non-volatile storage system
to it
dbms have been widely used in data processing environment since nineteen sixties because
before a transaction is allowed to alter the database, the alteration to be performed will
be recorded in the list
hence the list contains every action of the transaction
the point at which all the steps in a transaction have been recorded in the log is called the
commit point
at this point the dbms becomes committed to the transaction by guaranteeing that the transactions
activities will be reflected in the database
in the case of equipment failure, the dbms can use the information in its log to reconstruct
the transactions that have been completed since the last backup was made
if problems arise before the transaction has reached its commit point, the dbms might find
in normal situations when an object oriented program is executed, the objects created during
itself with a partially executed transaction
in this case, the log can be used to roll back the actions performed by the transaction
sometimes the rolling back of one transaction might affect the database entries that have
been used by other transactions
this means that these additional transactions must also be rolled back which may affect
still other transactions
this problem is known as cascading rollback
locking, the other problem associated with the dbms is the partial operations which produce
erroneous results
this is called incorrect summary problem
the program’s execution are discarded when the program terminates
suppose one transaction is in the middle of transferring funds from one account to another,
while another transaction is computing the total deposits in the bank
this may results in a total that is either too large or too small depending on the order
of these transactions
another problem is the lost update problem which is exemplified by two transactions,
each of which makes a deduction from the same account
if one of the transactions reads the account’s current balance at the point when the other
has just read the balance but not yet calculated the new balance
here both transactions will base their deductions on the same initial balance in which one of
the deductions will not be reflected in the database
but objects created and added to a database must be saved even after the termination of
to solve such problems a dbms could force transactions to execute in their integrity
or on a one at a time basis by holding the new transactions in a queue until those proceeding
it have completed
but a transaction may need to wait for a long time for the operations to be performed
hence large dbms contain a scheduler to coordinate time sharing among transactions in the same
way as time sharing operating system coordinates the processes
to protect against the incorrect summary problem and the lost update problem, the schedulers
incorporate a locking protocol in which the items within the database, currently being
used by some transactions are marked as such
these marks are called locks and the marked items are said to be locked
the program
two common types of locks are shared locks and exclusive locks
if a transaction is not going to alter a data item, then it requires a shared access but
if there is any alteration to the item it must have exclusive access
different algorithms are used to handle the cases in which a transactions access request
is rejected
the simplest algorithm is that the transaction is merely forced to wait until the requested
item becomes available
but this may lead to dead lock
in order to avoid dead lock, some dbms give priority to older transactions
hence if an older transaction requires access to an item that is locked by a younger transaction,
hence the objects in the database are persistent
the younger transaction is forced to release the data items and its activities are rolled back
if a younger transaction is repeatedly preempted, it will grow older and will be one among the
older transactions
this protocol is called wound wait protocol and will ensure that every transaction will
be allowed to complete its task
now, it’s time to summarize the session
in this module, an object oriented database system and its advantages over the traditional
relational model are discussed in detail
this module gives an account of the characteristics of odbms and oql
the module ends by referring to the integrity issues of the dbms and methods to solve these
if you are making an object oriented programing language into a database programing language,
problems like commit, roll back, locking and wound wait protocol
before we attend the next unit please try to answer the following questions
what is a persistent object?
what are the advantages of an object oriented database over a relational database?
what is meant by cascading roll back?
what is the importance of maintaining database integrity?
briefly explain the odbms
write a note on oql

kim won , introduction to object-oriented database
the mit press, nineteen ninety
hope you enjoyed the session, see you next time until then good bye
there are different approaches for this and are listed below
persistence by class, the simplest but most inconvenient way is to declare that a class
is persistent
of the characteristics such as data sharing, independence, consistency and integrity which
when by default all objects of the class are persistent
persistence by creation, here new syntax is introduced to create persistent objects
an object is said to be either persistent or transient depending on the way of creation
persistence by marking, in this approach after the creation of the objects they are marked
as persistent, all object are created as transient objects
but if an object is persist, beyond the execution of the program it must be marked explicitly
as persistent before the program terminates
persistence by reachability, one or more objects are explicitly declared as root or persistent objects
the other objects are persistent if and only if they are reachable from root object through
a sequence of one or more references
the traditional file systems lack
there are different methods to find an object in the database, one method is to give names
to objects as names given to files
and other method is to expose object identifiers or persistent pointers to the objects which
can be stored externally
yet another way is to store collections of object
these objects can be modelled as objects of a collection type, most object oriented database systems
support all the three ways to access persistent object
characteristics of odbms, the database system should satisfy certain characteristics to
be an object database
they are, encapsulation, types, classes, inheritance, complex objects, object identity, extensibility,
an object database or object oriented database management system is a database management
persistence, overloading, overriding, computational completeness, storage management, concurrency
and recovery
encapsulation, encapsulation can be viewed either in programing language view or the
database adaptation of that view
encapsulation is the representation of the data object by its attributes and the associated
methods specify to manipulate those data objects
here the operations performed on the data objects are visible
but the data and the implementation are hidden
types and classes, type refers to the particular set of objects in the system consisting of
interface and the implementations
system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object oriented programing
generally, interfaces are visible to the user and the implementations are hidden
class is a template for creating the objects of a particular type having there on implementations
the new objects can be created by performing new operation on the class
inheritance, inheritance is the most important feature of the object database, which specifies
the hierarchical relationships between different objects at different levels and give core reusability
there are different types of inheritance like substitution inheritance, constraint inheritance,
inclusion inheritance and specialization inheritance
complex objects, complex objects are built by using the basic data objects like integers,
strings, real numbers and boolean
there are various complex data objects such as array, list, index, tuples, etcetera
the term object oriented database system first appeared around nineteen eighty-five and notable
user can define methods to manipulate these new complex types
object identity, it is a very important issue in database, each object has to be uniquely
identified from the whole database or similar kinds of objects
each object has a unique identity and we can access and edit the object by using this
it can be variable name or a physical address space in memory
extensibility, database system has its own predefined set of data types using which we
can write new types and there is no usage difference between the built in types and
the user defined type
but there may be strong difference in the way to a supported
persistence, it is the ability of system data to preserve or survive during execution so
research projects included encore-ob server, iris, ode, orion, etcetera
that it can be further used by another process
persistency provides the reusability
overriding and overloading, they use the same name for implementing the object methods or
operations to represent the same data in different ways
computational completeness, this property says that we can define or implement any kind
of computable function for the odb using dml of database system
computational complete system gives almost all of the operation implementation
secondary storage management, the data in system is managed so as to get the quick and
easier access, it is supported using different techniques including data clustering, indexing,
query optimization, data buffering and access part section
for example, an object oriented implementation of the employee database consists of three
but these are invisible to users, it has two levels of management such as logical and physical
concurrency, when a large number of users are interacting with the database the system
must provide same level of service to all the users
it should avoid the system failure, incomplete transactions, etcetera
the techniques for this come under concurrency
recovery, the system should be able to recover itself to original state if it suffers from
the hardware or software failures
rdbms verses odbms, an object oriented database stores complex data and relationships between
data directly without mapping to relational rows and columns
and this make them suitable for applications dealing with very complex data
classes or three types of objects such as employee, job and job assignment
welcome
if there is a violation in any of the constraints operation will fail
domain constraints these are attribute level constraints, an attribute can only take values
which lie inside the domain range example, if a constraints age great than zero is applied
on student relation, inserting negative value of age will result in failure
key integrity every relation in the database should have at least one set of attributes
which defines a tuple uniquely those set of attributes is called key example, serial
number in student is a key, no two students can have the same role number or serial number,
referential integrity when one attribute of a relation can only take values from other
attribute of same relation or any other relation it is called referential integrity let us
all the data is represented in terms of tuples grouped into relations a database organized
suppose we have two relations, one student table with fields serial number, name, place
phone, age and branch code
and another table branch with branch code and branch name branch code of student can
only take the values which are present in branch code of branch, which is called referential
integrity constraint the relation which is referencing to other relation is called referencing
relation, student in this case and the relation to which other relations refer is called referenced
relation, in this case branch
anomalies an anomaly is an irregularity or something which deviates from the expected
or normal state when designing database we identify three types of anomalies, insert,
update and delete an update anomaly is a data inconsistency that results from data
in terms of the relational model is a relational database the greatest strength of the relational
redundancy and a partial update for example, each student in the college has a department
associated with them and a student group if the use of performing the update does not
realize that the data is stored redundantly the update will not be done properly
a deletion anomaly is the unintended loss of data due to deletion of other data if
any of the fields are deleted from the table, the other data related to the field also may
be deleted this results in database inconsistencies an insertion anomaly is the inability to add
to the data to the database due to absence of other data if any of the attribute value
is missing for some data that cannot be included in the database, these three anomalies are
undesirable in any database and can be avoided by the process of normalization
normalization is a database design technique which organizes tables in a manner that reduces
model is the simple logical structure that it forms other kinds of software besides
redundancy and dependency of data it divides larger tables to smaller tables and links
them using relationships
insertion anomaly in referencing relation we can’t insert a row in referencing relation,
if referencing attributes value is not present in referenced attribute value example, insertion
of a student with branch_code ‘me’ in student relation will result in error because
‘me’ is not present in branch_code of branch
deletion or updation anomaly in referenced relation we can't delete or update a row
from referenced relation if value of referenced attribute is used in values of referencing
attribute example, if we try to delete tuple from branch having branch_code ‘cs’ it
will automatically in error because ‘cs’ is referenced by branch_code of student, but
database systems can make good use of tables of information as well
if we try to delete the row from branch with branch_code ee it will be deleted as the value
is not been used by referencing relation
it can be handled by following method on delete cascade it well delete the tuples
from referencing relation if value used by referencing attribute is deleted from referenced
relation example, if we delete a row from branch with branch_code ‘cs’ the rows
in student relation with branch_code cs that is row number four and six in this case will be deleted
on update cascade it will update the referencing attribute in referencing relation, if attribute
value used by referencing attribute is updated in referenced relation example, if we update
a row from branch with brand_code cs to ‘cse’, the rows in the student relation with branch_code
‘cs’, that is roll number one and two in this case will be updated with branch_code ‘cse’
and the relational data model helps us design these tables and develop the data structures
super keys any set of attributes that allows us to identify unique rows or tuples in a
given relation are known as super keys out of the super keys we can always have a proper
subset which can be used as primary key such keys are known as candidate keys if there
is a combination of two or more attributes which is being used as the primary key, then
we call it as a composite key
in this module relational database model and its characteristics are discussed in detail
this module gives an account of the fundamental concepts in relational model the module ends
by referencing various constraints in relational model and different anomalies which deviates
the relational models from the expected state hope you enjoyed the session, see you next
time, until then bye
that we need to assess them efficiently for example, such tables are used by compilers
to store information about the variables used in the program keeping track of their data
type and of the functions for which they are defined
relational model concepts, relational model represents how data is stored in relational
data basis a relation also known as table or file is a subset of the cartesian product
to the session on relational data model
of a list of domains characterized by a name and within a table each row represents a group
of related data values, a row or record is also known as a tuple the columns in a table
are referred to as fields or attributes you can also think of it this way
an attribute is used to define the record and a record contains a set of attributes
the steps below outlined the logic between a relation and its domains given n domains
are denoted by d one, d two, etcetera dn and r is a relation defined on these domains
then r is a subset of d one cross d two cross etcetera cross dn
a database is composed of multiple tables and each table holds the data following figure
shows a database that contains three tables a database stores pieces of information or
facts in an organized way, understanding how to use and get the most out of the database
one of the most important applications of computers
requires us to understand that method of organization
the principal storage units are called columns or fields or attributes, this house the basic
components of data into which your content can be broken down when deciding which field
to create, you need to think generically about your information for example, drawing out
the common components of the information that you will store in the database and avoiding
the specifics that distinguished one item from another
look at the example of an id card in the following figure to see the relationship between fields
and their data a domain is the original sets of atomic values used to model data by atomic
value we mean that each value in the domain is invisible as far as the relational model
is concerned for example, the domain of marital status has a set of possibilities, married,
is storing and managing information the manner in which information is organized to have
single or divorced
the domain of shift has the set of all possible days monday, tuesday, wednesday etcetera
the domain of salary is the set of all floating point numbers greater than zero and less than
two lakh the domain of first name is the set of character strings that represents names
of people in summary, a domain is a set of acceptable values that a column is allowed
to contain this is based on various properties and the data type for the column
just as the content of anyone document or item needs to be broken down into its constituent
bits of data for storage in the fields the link between them also needs to be available
so that they can be reconstituted into their whole form records allow us to do this
records contain fields that are related, such as a customer or an employee, as noted earlier
an important role on how easily it can be assessed and managed
a tuple is another term used to for record records and fields form the basis of all databases
a simple table gives the clearest picture of how records and fields work together in
a database storage project the simple table example in figure shows us how fields can
hold a range of different sorts of data this one has a record id field, this is an ordinal
number, its data type is integer a pubdate field this is displayed as day, month, year,
its data type is date and author field this is displayed as initial surname, its data
type is text a title field text, free text can be entered here
you can command the database to shift through its data and organized it in a particular
way for example, you can request that a selection of records be limited by date, one, all before
a given date, two, all after given date or three, all between two given dates similarly,
relational data model is the primary data model, which is used widely around the world
you can choose to have records sorted by date because the field or record containing the
data is set up as a date field the database reached the information in the date field
not just as numbers separated by slashes but rather as dates that must be ordered according
to a calendar system
properties of a table a table has a name that is distinct from all other tables in
the database there are no duplicate rows, each row is distinct entries in columns are
atomic the tables does not contain repeating groups or multi valued attributes
entries from columns are from the same domain based on their data type including number
that can be numeric, integer or float, smallint, etcetera character or string then date, logical,
true or false values operations combining different data types are disallowed each
for data storage and processing this model is simple and it has all the properties and
attribute has a distinct name, the sequence of columns is insignificant the sequence
of rows is insignificant
important terminologies a relational database stores data in the form of relations or tables
consider a relation student with attributes serial number, name, place, phone and age
shown in the following table in relational data model relations are saved in the format
of tables this format stores the relation among entities a table has rows and columns
where rows represents records and columns represent the attributes
attribute attributes are the properties that define a relation example, serial number
or name tuple, a single row of a table which contains a single record for that relation
is called a tuple the above relation contains six tuples, one of which is one zero one,
capabilities required to process data with storage efficiency the relational model or
thomas, kochi, nine one five six two five three one three one and twenty
relations schema a relation schema represents the logical structure of a relation it can
be represented by the name of the relation with its attributes example, student of serial
number, name, place, phone and age is relation schema for student a relational schema can
be described an outline of a database that specifies the way data is organized into tables
relation instance the set of tuples of a relation at a particular instance of time
is called as relation instance the above table shows the relation instance of student
at a particular time it can change whenever there is insertion, deletion or updation in
the database degree the number of attributes in the relation is known as degree of the
relation the student relation defined above has degree five cardinality the number of
r m is first described in nineteen sixty nine by english computer scientist edgar f codd
tuples in a relation is known as cardinality the student relation defined above has cardinality six
column column represents the set of values for a particular attribute, the column serial
number is extracted from relation student null values the value which is not known
or unavailable is called null value it is represented by blank space example, phone
of student having serial number six is null relation key each row has one or more attributes
known as relation key which can identify the row in the relation or table uniquely, example
serial number for student
constraints in relational model while designing relational model we define some conditions
which must hold for data present in the database called constraints these constraints are
checked before performing any operation such as insertion, deletion and updation in databases
the relational model organizes data into collections of two dimensional tables called relations
welcome to the session on structured query language
which column headings we prefer to see above the result table
the select close is the first close and is one of the last closest of the select statement
that the database server evaluates
the reason for this is that before we can determine what to include in the final result
set we need to know all the possible columns that could be included in the final result
set
syntax of sql select statement- to create a simple sql select statement, you must specify
the column’s name and the table name
the whole query is called sql select statement
it will look like select distinct attribute_list from table-name where condition, group by
the steps required to execute sql commands are handled transparently by the sql database
attributes having condition, order by attributes descending
table_name is the name of the table from which the information is retrieved
attribute_list includes one or more columns from which data is retrieved
the code within the brackets is optional
for example, consider the table student with columns, serial number, name, place, phone
and age
the values given are one zero one, thomas, kochi, nine one five six two five three one
three one with age value twenty and six records are inserted like this
to select the first name of all the students the query would be like select name from student,
output may look like a table with the column heading name and the values thomas, anu, sam,
sometimes sql is characterized as non procedural because procedural languages generally require
suresh, akbar and ram
you can also retrieve data from more than one column
for example, to select name and place of all the students the query will look like select
name, comma place from student
output will be a table with two column headings, name and place and the values retrieved from
the above specified table
to fetch all the fields from the table student we can use select star from student, the output
will be a table with all the column headings serial number, name, place, phone and age
with all the value specified in the table
sql where clause- the where clause is used when you want to retrieve specific information
the details of the operations to be specified, such as opening and closing tables, loading
from a table excluding other irrelevant data
for example, when you want to see the information about students in class tenth only then you
do need the information about the students in other class
retrieving information about all the students would increase the processing time for the
query
so, sql offers a feature called where clause where we can use to restrict the data that
is retrieved
the condition you provide in the where clause filters the rows retrieved from the table
and gives you only those rows which you expected to see
where clause can be used along with select, delete, update statements
and searching indexes or flushing buffers and writing data to file systems
syntax of sql where clause - where within brackets column or expression and comparison
operator value
syntax for where clause with select statement is select column_list from table-name where
condition
column or expression is the column of a table or an expression, comparison operator is some
operator like equal to, less than, greater than, etcetera
value, any user value or a column name for comparison
sql operators- there are two type of operators namely comparison operators and logical operators,
these operators are used mainly in the where clause having close to filter the data to
be selected
therefore, sql is considered to be designed at a higher conceptual level of operation
comparison operators- comparison operators are used to compare the column data with specific
value in a condition
comparison operators are also used along with the select statement to filter data based
on specific conditions
the table given here describes each comparison operator
equal to is for equal to, less than, greater than symbol or exclamation equal to for not
equal to, less than for less than, greater than, greater than or equal to, less than
or equal to, etcetera
logical operators- there are three logical operators namely and, or, and not, these operators
compare two conditions at a time to determine whether a row can be selected for the output
than procedural languages because the lower level logical and physical operations are
when retrieving data using a select statement you can use logical operators in the where
clause which allows you to combine more than one conditions
the logical operators and description is given in the table
or, for the row to be selected at least one of the conditions must be true
and, for a row to be selected all the specified conditions must be true
not, for a row to be selected the specified condition must be false
sql insert into statement- the insert into statement of sql is used to insert a new row
in a table
there are two ways of using insert into statements for inserting rows
only values, first method is to specify only the value of data to be inserted without the
in specified and are determined by the sql engine or server processes that execute it
column names
the syntax is insert into table_name values value one, value two, etcetera upto value n
table_name, name of the table, value one, value two, etcetera are the values of the
first column, second column, etcetera for the new record
column names and values both, in the second method we will specify both the columns which
we want to fill and their corresponding values as shown here
syntax is insert into table_name column one, column two, etcetera column n values value
one, value two, etcetera value n, table_name is the name of the table, column one name
of the first column then second column, etcetera, value one, value two, value three etcetera
are the values for first column, second column and up to the final columns for the new record
sql commands
query example- if you want to insert a row to the student table, the query would be like
inset into student values six, srinath, delhi, nine double four five six nine seven five
two then nineteen
sql update statement- the update statement in sql is used to update the data of an existing
table in database, we can update single columns as well as multiple columns using update statement
as per our requirement
basic syntax is update table_name set column one equal to value one, column two equal to
value two, etcetera where condition
table_name is the name of the table, column one name of the first column, value one new
value for the first column, etcetera, condition is to select the rows for which the values
most of the actions you need to perform on a database are done with sql statements
of columns need to be updated
query example- update student set name equal to unknown where age equal to twenty
this query will update two rows, first row and fourth row and the table student will
now look like one zero one, unknown, kochi, nine one five six two five three one three
one, age twenty
one zero two, anu, bangalore, zero eight zero five four three nine seven six two, twenty
one
one zero three, sam, delhi, nine four double five one two three four five one, age twenty
one
one zero four, the name will be unknown, place chennai, phone number nine one nine one nine
sql commands are instructions coded into sql statements which are used to communicate with
structured query language or sql is a standard database language which is used to create,
five four three two one and age twenty
one zero five, akbar, mumbai, nine six five two four three one five four three, twenty
one and the serial number one zero six will be ram, kolkata, null value and nineteen
sql delete statement- the delete statement in sql is used to delete existing records
from a table
we can delete a single record or multiple records depending on the condition we specify
in the where clause
basic syntax is, delete from table_name where some_condition, table_name is the name of
the table, some condition are the condition to choose particular record
we can delete single as well as multiple records depending on the condition we provide in the
the database to perform specific task, work, functions and queries with data
where clause
if we omit the where clause than all of the records will be deleted and the table will
be empty
query example- delete from student where name equal to unknown
this query will delete two rows, first row and the fourth row and the table student will
now look like one zero two, anu, bangalore, zero eight zero five four three nine seven
six two, twenty one
one zero three, sam, delhi, nine four five five one two three four five one, twenty one
one zero five, akbar, mumbai, nine six five two four three one five four three, twenty
one and one zero six ram, kolkata, null value and nineteen
sql commands can be used not only for searching the database but also to perform various other
sql is structured query language which is a computer language for storing, manipulating
and retrieving that are stored in a relational database
in this module the basic idea of structured query language is introduced
this module gives an account of the sql commands and statements, the module explains various
sql commands like select, create, update and delete in detail
hope you enjoy this session, see you next time, bye
functions like you can create tables, add data to tables or modify data, dropped the
table, set permissions for users, etcetera
sql commands are grouped into four major categories depending on their functionality
data definition language or ddl- these sql commands are used for creating, modifying
and dropping the structure of database objects
the commands are create, alter, drop, rename and truncate
all ddl commands are auto committed, that means it saves all the changes permanently
in the database
maintain and retrieve the relational database
examples of ddl commands are, create - is used to create the database or its objects
like table, index, function, views, store procedure and triggers
drop- is used to delete objects from the database, alter- is used to alter the structure of the
database, truncate- is used to remove all the records from a table including all spaces
allocated for the records are removed
comment- is used to add comments to the data dictionary
rename- is used to rename an object existing in the database
data manipulation language or dml- these sql commands are used to for storing, retrieving,
modifying and deleting data
these data manipulation language commands are select, insert, update and delete
it is used for storing and managing data in relational dbms
dml commands are not auto committed, it means changes are not permanent to database, they
can be rolled back
examples of dml, select- is used to retrieve data from the database
insert- is used to insert data into a table
update- is used to update existing data within a table
delete- is used to delete records from a database table
transaction control language or tcl- these sql commands are used to for managing changes
affecting the data
these commands are commit, rollback and savepoint
these commands are to keep a check on other commands and their effect on the database
sql was the first commercial language introduced for e f codd’s relational model of database
these commands can <?>annul</?>* changes made by other commands by rolling the data back
to its original state
it can also make any temporal change permanent
examples of tcl commands,
commit- commits a transaction rollback- rollbacks a transaction in case of any error occurs
savepoint- sets a savepoint within a transaction
data control language or dcl- these sql commands are used for providing security to database
objects, these commands are grant and revoke
dcl will grant and take back authority from any database user
examples of dcl commands, grant- gives users access privileges to database
today almost are relational database management systems such as mysql, oracle, infomix, sybase,
revoke- withdraw user’s access privileges given by using the grant command
sql create table statement- there are two create statements available in sql, create
database and create table
sql create database - the create database statement is used to create a database, after
creating a database we can create several other database objects like tables, views,
procedures, etcetera into it
the user should have admin privileges for creating database
sql create database statement - create database database_name and collate colliation_name
in the above query database_name is the name of the database to be created, collation_name
is the default coalition like character set for the database
ms access, etcetera use sql as the standard database query language
this collation_name is an optional field and if not provided then default collation is
assigned to the database
create database example, if you want to create database, my database with default collation,
the statement would be like create database mydatabase terminated with semicolon
sql create table- we have learned about creating database
now, to store the data we need a table to do that
the create table statement is used to create a table in sql
we know that a table comprises of rows and columns, so while creating tables we have
to provide all the information to sql about the names of the columns, type of data to
be stored in columns, size of the data, etcetera
sql is used to perform all types of data operations in rdbms
let's now dive into details on how to use create table statement to create tables in
sql
create table table_name coloumn one data_type within brackets the size, column two data_type,
size, column three database size, etcetera terminated with semicolon
table_name is the name of the table, column one name of the first column, data_type is
the type of the data we want to store in the particular column
for example, int for integer data
size, size of the data we can store in a particular column, for example, for a column we specified
the data type as int and size as ten, then this column can store an integer number of
maximum ten digits
sql is a declarative language in which the expected result or operation is given without
example query- this query will create a table named students with five columns, role number,
name, place, phone and age
query will be like create table student within brackets serial number int of three, name
varchar of twenty, place varchar of twenty, phone int of ten, age two
sql select statement- select is the most commonly used statement in sql, the select statement
in sql is used to retrieve or fetch data from a database
we can fetch either the entire table or according to some specified rules
the data returned is stored in a result table
this result table is also called result set, with the select close of a select command
statement we specify the columns that we want to be displayed in the query result and optionally
the specific details about how to accomplish the task
welcome back
lans are distinguished from other type of networks by their transmission media and topology
the most common lan topologies are bus, ring and star
the speeds of the lans are normally hundred to thousand mbps
wireless lans are the newest evolution in lans technology
ieee has defined the specification for a wireless lan called ieee eight naught two point one
one which covers the physical and data link layer
wide area network or wan- a wan links machines over a greater distance like neighboring cities
or opposite sides of the world
wan provides long distance transmission of data, image, audio and video over large geographical
area such as country, continent or the whole world
not only audio or video, but every type of information or resources
a wan can be simple enough to connect a home computer to the internet or can be as complex
as the backbones that connect the internet, the wireless wan is getting more popular now
metropolitan area network or man- a man is with a size between a lan and a wan
it normally spans a local connectivity like inside a town or a city
it is designed for high speed connectivity
an example of man is the part of the telephone company network that provides a high speed
dsl line to the customer
another common example is the cable tv
network that originally was designed for cable tv, but today can also be used for high speed
data connection to the internet
network classifications- a network is a set of devices or nodes connected by communication links
today, isolated use of lan, wan or man is very rare
instead, they are connected to one another to form an internetwork or internet
network protocols- for a network to do its functions reliably there should be some rules
and regulations to conduct the activities
such rules are called protocols
these protocols standards have its own importance in developing network technologies and communication
with other systems
without any rules governing to the communication of different models in a network all may try
to transmit messages at the same time or may fail to relay messages
when approached use is the token ring protocol developed by ibm in nineteen seventies and
a node can be a computer, printer or any other device capable of sending and or receiving
still using in networks based on ring topology
in this protocol, all the machines in the network transmit messages in one common direction
hence, all the messages will move in the same direction by being forwarded from node to node
when the message reaches its destination, the destination machine keeps a copy of it
and forwards around the ring
when the forwarded copy reaches the originating computer, that machine knows that the message
must have reached its destination and removes the message from the ring
to avoid the problem of a single machine transmitting messages of its own constantly, a unique bit
pattern called a token is passed around the ring
only the machine which posses the token is allowed to transmit its own messages
data generated by other nodes on the networks
without the token, a machine is only allowed to forward messages
if the token possessed has multiple messages to transmit after transmitting one message
and when that message completes its cycle, the machine should forward the token to the network
in this way, each machine in the network has equal opportunity to include messages of its
own as the token goes around the ring
another protocol for coordinating message transmission is used in bus topology is based
on ethernet protocol collection
the right to transmit messages is controlled by the protocol known as carrier sense multiple
access with collision detection or csma by cd
according to this protocol, each message be broadcasted to all the machines on the bus
a network must be able to meet a certain number of criteria
each machine monitors all and receives only those which are addressed to them
to transmit message a machine waits until the bus is silent and then transmits, if another
machine also begins transmitting both machines detect the clash or coalition and waits for
certain amounts of time before trying to transmit again
combining networks- sometimes to extend a communication system, existing networks are
connected
this is done by connecting the networks to form a large version of the same type of networks
for example, bus networks are connected to form a single large bus
this is done by the devices known as repeaters, bridges and switches
the repeater simply passes signals back and forth between the two original buses with
the most important of these are performance, reliability and security
some amplification without considering the meaning of the signals
a bridge is more complex than a repeater
it connects two buses, but does not necessarily pass all messages across the connection
it looks at the destination address accompanied with each message and forward it only when
the destination is on the other side
thus, two machines residing on the same side of the bridge can exchange messages without
interfering the communication on the other side
a switch is a bridge with multiple connections, allowing it to connect several buses rather
than just two
as with bridges a switch consider the destination address of all messages and forwards only
performance- performance can be measured in different ways, including transit time and
those messages <?>the stand</?> for other spokes
the existence of repeaters, bridges and switches is transparent to the individual computers
in the system
sometimes, the network to be connected have incompatible connection characteristics, between
ring with token ring and ethernet bus with csma by cd
in such cases, the network must be connected in the manner that builds a network of networks
called internet, not the internet
the connection between two networks to form an internet is handled by a router
a router is a computer belonging to both networks that forwards messages in one network to another
the task of router is significantly greater because it should convert from a network using
response time
one protocol to another network using some other protocol
the networks are categorized by the roles, the server and the pcs play in terms of hierarchical
and security interaction
some networks are server based networks and some other are peer to peer networks
server based model- server based networks usually include many nodes and one or more
servers, which control user access to the networks resources
this central computer is known as the file server, network server,
application server or just server
files and programs used by more than one user are often stored on the server
when a node needs information from the server, it request the file containing the information,
transit time is the amount of time required for a message to travel from one device to another
the server stored and forwards the files to nodes that request them
users or nodes must log on to the network to gain access to its resources
an important type of server based network is the client server network where individual
computers share the processing and storage workload with a central server
client server networks can be used on lans or wans
the common example of a client server computing is a database that can be accessed by many
computers on the network
when a user needs to find information in the database the client software sends a query
to the server, which searches the database and returns the information to the user's pc
peer to peer model- in peer to peer network or p to pn or workgroup all nodes on the network
response time is the elapsed time between an inquiry and a response
in this module, we are going to discuss about computer networks
have equal relationships to all others and all have similar type of software that supports
the sharing of resources
here, each node has access to at least some of the resources on all other nodes
many client operating systems such as windows nine x, windows two thousand, windows me,
windows xp and the macintosh os have built in support for peer to peer networking
one of the most desirable characteristics of the peer to peer network is the managed
and controlled access to the shared resources
some high end peer to peer networks allow distributed computing
the internet- simply stating the internet is a network and a global communication system
that links together several thousands of individual networks
the performance of a network depends on a number of factors like number of users, type
this enhances the users of any computer on any network to exchange messages, communicate
in real time, share data and programs with any other user on any other network
the internet started its journey in nineteen sixty nine when the advanced research projects
agency or the arpa of the us department of defense began connecting computers at different
universities and defense contractors, the network was called arpanet
the internet acts as a carrier for several different services, each with its own distinct
features and purposes
the most commonly used internet services are electronic mail, news, file transfer protocol,
chat, instant messaging, online services and peer to peer services
security- when a computer is connected to a network, chance for attack and unauthorized
of medium, capabilities of the hardware and efficiency of software
access are more
there are numerous ways in which a computer system and the data it can be attacked if
it is connected to any network some malicious software are used for this
example for this type of software are, viruses, worms, trojan horses and spyware
a virus is a software or programming code that replicates by being copying or initiating
its copying to another program, computer boot sector or document
viruses can be transmitted as attachments to an email node or in a downloaded file or
be present on a diskette or cd
some viruses are playful in intent and some can be quite harmful, erasing data or causing
the hard disk to require reformatting
reliability- it is measured by the accuracy of delivery, frequency of failure, time it
it is important to note that a virus cannot be spread without a human action, such as
running an infected program to keep it going
a worm is similar to a virus by design and is considered to be a type of virus, worm
spread from computer to computer, but unlike a virus, it has the capacity to travel without
any human action
a worm takes advantage of file or information transport features on the system to travel itself
the biggest danger with a worm is its capability to replicate itself on the system
so, rather than a single computer sending out a single worm, it could send out hundreds
or thousands of copies of itself
a trojan horse is full of as much trickery as the mythological trojan horse it was named after
takes a link to recover from a failure and the networks robustness
the trojan horse will actually do damage if it is installed or run on the computer once
those on the receiving end of a trojan horse are usually tricked into opening them because
they appear to be receiving legitimate software or files from a legitimate source
when a trojan is activated on the computer, the results can vary
some trojans are designed to be more annoying than malicious like changing the stop or adding
silly active desktop icons or they can cause serious damage by deleting files and destroying
information on the system
trojans are also known to create a backdoor on computers that gives malicious user’s
access to the system, possibly allowing confidential or personal information to be compromised
unlike viruses and worms, trojans do not reproduce by infecting other files nor do they self
security- network security issues include protection from unauthorized access, damage
replicate
another type of malicious software is the spyware that collects information about activities
at the computer on which it resides and reports it to the attacker
a firewall is used as a primary prevention technique for such attacks
spam filters are firewalls to block unwanted email
proxy server is used as an intermediary between a client and a server to shield the client
from the actions of a server
antivirus softwares are used to detect the presence of non viruses and other infections
this module provides a base for computer networks, which includes the study of how the various
resources such as hardware, software and information are shared among different computers
of data, development of new information and implementing policies and procedures for recovery
here the different types of computer networks based on size and topology are illustrated
this module covers the topics such as various connectors used in the network and different
communication through the network

according to the physical layout of the network and the number of devices connected network
can be classified into different types
based on topology- the term topology refers to the way in which networks are physically
with the advent of computers in every field of life, sharing of resources such as hardware,
connected together
topology determines the complexity and therefore the cost of the network cable installation
it is the geometric representation of the relationship to one another, basic topologies
are bus, ring, star and mesh
bus topology- here, a single main cable connects each node and each node is connected to two
other, the one long cable act as the backbone to link all the devices in the network
nodes are connected to the bus cable by drop lines and tapes
the drop line is the connection running between the devices and the main cable
a tape is a connector that either splices into the main cable or punctures the <?>shutting</?>
of a cable to create a contact with the metallic core
software and information became an emerging need
the network operating system keeps track of a unique electronic address for each node
and manages the flow of data based on this addressing scheme
the bus topology is the simplest and most widely used network design
as a signal travels along the backbone, it becomes weaker and weaker as it travels further
and further
hence, there is a limit on the number of tapes a bus can support and on the distance between
those tapes
bus topology is easy to install and uses less cabling, but it is difficult for reconnection
and fault isolation
adding new devices require modification or replacement of the backbone, as it is usually
the necessity of sharing resources among different computers led to the lined computer system
designed to be optimally efficient at installation
bus topology was one of the first topologies used in the early lance
ring topology- in ring topology, each device has a dedicated point to point connection
with only the two devices on either side of it
a signal is passed along the ring in one direction from device to device until it reaches its
destination
each device in the ring uses a repeater when a device receives a signal intended for another
device, its repeater regenerates the bits and passes them along
a ring is easy to install and reconfigure, adding or deleting a device requires changing
only two connections, but it has a maximum ring length and restriction for number of devices
called networks
but, unidirectional traffic has the disadvantage that a break in the ring such as a disabled
station can disable the entire network
this is solved by using a dual ring or a switch that is capable of closing off the break
ring networks usually follow a token passing protocol
star topology- each computer on a star topology has a dedicated point to point link with a
central hub that resends the message either to all the computers or in a broadcast star
network or only to the destination computer in the switch to start network
of these topologies the star network is perhaps the oldest having evolved from the paradigm
of a large central computer serving many users
a star topology is less expensive than a mesh topology
business today rely on computer networks and internet
additions, moves and deletions involve only one connection between that device and the hub
if one link fails, only that link is affected
all other links remain active
this factor makes fault identification and fault isolation an easy task
the biggest disadvantage of star topology is that the whole topology is dependent on
a single point called hub
if the hub goes down, the whole system is dead
in a mesh topology- every device has a dedicated point to point link to every other device
the term dedicated means that the link carries traffic only between the two devices it connects
the number of physical links in a fully connected mesh network with n nodes is n into n minus
the development of personal computers brought an ever new change to business, industry,
one divided by two
a mesh offers several advantages over other network topologies
the use of dedicated links guarantees that each connection can carry its own data load,
thus eliminating the traffic problems that can occur when links must be shared by multiple devices
if one link becomes unusable, it does not affect the entire system
this type of network has an added advantage of privacy or security
when every message travels along a dedicated line only the intended recipient sees it
physical boundaries prevent other users from gaining access to messages
the disadvantage of mesh are the amount of cabling and the number of input output ports required
an example of a mesh topology is the connection of telephone regional offices in which each
science and education
regional office needs to be connected to every other regional office
next, based on size, the category of a network is generally determined by its size, they
are local area network or lan- lan is usually privately owned
it normally consists of a collection of computers in a single building, office or campus
for example, the computers on a university campus or those in a manufacturing company
are connected by a lan
depending on the needs of an organization and the type of technology used, a lan can
be simple like two pcs and a printer or it can be extended to include the entire company
and its audio and video peripherals
currently, size of the lan is limited to a few kilometers
in the same way, data communication and computer networks open up a very broad way to exchange
welcome to the session on guided transmission media
applications- coaxial cable was widely used in analog telephone networks where a single
coaxial network could carry ten thousand voice signals
later it was used in digital telephone networks where a single coaxial cable could carry digital
data up to six hundred mbps
cable tv networks also use coaxial cables
another common application of coaxial cable is in traditional ethernet lans
because of its high bandwidth, and consequently high data rate, coaxial cable was chosen for
digital transmission in early ethernet lans
optical fiber cable- an optical fiber or a fiber optics cable is made of glass or plastic
and transmits signals in the form of light
path
if a ray of light travels from a denser medium to less dense medium, if the angle of incidence
is less than the critical angle, the ray refracts and moves closer to the surface
if the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle, the ray reflects and travels
again in the denser medium
this phenomenon is known as total internal reflection
optical fiber uses reflection to guide light through a channel
a glass or plastic core is surrounded by a cladding of a less dense glass or plastic
the difference in density of the two materials should be such that a beam of light moving
through the core is reflected of the cladding instead of being refracted into it
that is optical-fiber work on the principle that the core refracts the light and the cladding
data signal in guided medium is bound by the cabling system
reflects the light
these light pulses which can be carried over long distances through optical fiber cable
carry information
there are three types of transmission modes used by optical fibers
multimode- multiple beams from a light source move through the core in different paths
in multimode step index fiber, density of the core remains constant from the centre
to the edges
in multimode graded index fiber, density is highest at the centre of the core and decreases
gradually to its lowest at the edges
single mode- single mode uses step index fiber and a highly focused source of light that
hence, guided medium is also known as bound medium
limits beams to a small range of angles, all close to the horizontal
the single mode fiber is manufactured with a much smaller diameter than that of multimode
fiber and with substantially lower density index of refraction
the decrease in density results in a critical angle that is close enough to ninety degree
to make the propagation of beams almost horizontal
in this case, propagation of different beams is almost identical and delays are negligible
all the beams arrive at the destination together and can be recombined with little distortion
to the signal
advantages- with the large bandwidth, they can transmit large volume of data at very
high speed and long distances
there are three basic type of guided transmission media such as twisted pair cable, coaxial
light signals can travel at much higher speed than electrical signals with no significant
loss of intensity over long distance
since optical fibers are made of glass or plastic they are not affected by magnetic
or electric fields
small size and light weight
it is highly secured and extremely difficult to tap optical signals
disadvantages- installation and maintenance of optical fiber is costly since it requires
special equipment and experts
being fragile they cannot turn at sharp corners
joining two optical fiber cable requires special equipment and hence, it is costly
cable and fiber-optic cable
fiber optic connectors- there are three types of connectors for fiber optic cables
the subscriber channel or sc connector is used for cable tv
it uses a push pull locking system
the straight-tip or st connector is used for connecting cable to networking devices
it uses a bayonet locking system and is more reliable than sc
mt-rj is a connector that is same size as rj forty-five
applications- fiber optic cable is often found in backbone networks because its wide bandwidth
is cost effective
today with wave length division multiplexing that is wdm, we can transfer data at a rate
of thousand six hundred gbps
twisted pair cable- a twisted pair consists of two conductors each with <?>easton</?>
some cable tv companies use a combination of optical fiber and coaxial cable, thus creating
a hybrid network
optical fiber provides the backbone structure while coaxial cable provides the connection
to the user premises
this is a cost-effective configuration, since the narrow bandwidth requirement at the user
end does not justify the use of optical fiber
local-area networks such as hundred base-fx network (fast ethernet) and thousand base-
x, also use fiber optic cable
this module gives the details of the commonly used guided transmission media for carrying
information through a network
plastic insulation twisted together in a helical form to reduce electrical interferences from
guided media use a cabling system that guide the data signals along a specific path
information from one network device to another passes through this medium
it consists of a cable, composed of metals like copper or tin
since, the guided medium is bound by the cabling system, they are also known as bounded medium
the three-basic types of cables, such as twisted pair, coaxial cable and fiber optic are discussed
here with the features, advantages,
disadvantages and applications thanks for watching this session
see you next time, until then bye
similar pair close by
one of the conductors actually carries the data while the others serve as ground reference
the receiver side uses the difference between the two conductors
in the field of computer networks, a transmission medium can be considered as anything which
twisted-pair cables are of two types, utp and stp
the most common type of twisted-pair cable used in communication is referred to as unshielded
twisted-pair or utp
it is commonly used in telephone system
the cable has four pairs of wire inside a jacket, normally plastic
each pair is twisted with different number of twists per inch to eliminate interferences
from adjacent pairs
the tighter the twisting, the higher the supported transmission rate and the cost per foot
shielded twisted pair or stp cable has a metal foil or braided mesh covering that encases
each pair of insulated conductors
carries data from a source node to a destination node
this improves the quality of the cable by preventing the penetration of noise
but, it is bulkier and more expensive than utp
twisted pairs can run several kilometers without amplification but for longer distance repeaters
are needed
this type of wires can be used for either analog or digital transmission
the bandwidth depends on the thickness of the wire and the distance travelled
twisted pair cable connectors, the most common utp connector is rj forty-five, rj stands
for registered jack
the rj forty-five is a key to connector, meaning, the connector can be inserted in only one way
advantages- their performance is adequate, they are inexpensive, easy to install and
computers and other electronic devices use signals to represent data
use, and disadvantages- when the line length extends beyond hundred meters, the error rate
is high
hence, the length is limited
applications of twisted pair cables, twisted pair cables are used in telephone lines to
provide voice and data channels
the local loop, the line that connects subscribers to the central telephone office, commonly
consists of unshielded twisted pair cables
they are used in the dsl lines that are used by the telephone companies to provide high-data-rate
connections
local-area networks, such as ten base-t, hundred base-t use twisted pair cables
these signals are transmitted from one device to another in the form of electro-magnetic
coaxial cables- coaxial cables are used to carry signals having higher frequency range
than those in twisted pair cables
coaxial cables are specially wrapped and insulated wires capable of transmitting data at higher rates
it consists of a central copper wire, surrounded by a pvc insulation <?>4:24</?> there is sleeve
of copper mesh
the copper mesh is again shielded by a thick pvc material
coaxial cable gets its name because it contains two conductors that are parallel to each other
the actual data travels through the centre conductor in the cable
electromagnetic interference or emi is caught by the outer copper mesh
there are different types of coaxial cables vary by gauge and impedance
energy which is propagated through the transmission medium
gauge is the measure of cable thickness
these are measured by radio grade or sometimes referred to as radio government which is denoted
as rg number
they can transmit data at the rate of ten mbps
they are used extensively in long distance telephone lines and cables for cable tv
they have higher noise immunity
coaxial cable standards- coaxial cables are categorized by their radio government or rg ratings
each rg number denotes a unique set of physical specifications including the wire gauge of
the inner conductor, the thickness and type of the inner insulator, the construction of
the shield and the size and type of the outer casing
transmission media can be broadly classified into guided transmission media and unguided
some commonly used types are listed here-
the coaxial type rg four has characteristic impedance fifty point zero, outside diameter
five point seven four, velocity factor point six six and it’s a braid shield material
rg twenty two has impedance of ninety five, outer diameter ten point seven, velocity factor
point six six and it is also a braid shield
rg twenty three which has characteristic impedance of one twenty five, outside diameter twenty
four point zero, velocity factor zero point six six and braid shield
rg twenty-four, also of impedance one twenty-five with outside diameter twenty-five point five,
velocity factor point six six and braid shield
rg thirty-four with impedance seventy-five, outside diameter sixteen point zero, velocity
transmission media
factor point six six and braid shield
rg one zero eight has the characteristic impedance seventy eight, outside diameter six point
zero and it is also braid shield
rg two one three by u which has the characteristic impedance of fifty and outside diameter ten
point three, velocity factor point six six, which is braid shield, polythene dielectric
material
rg two one four by u has fifty characteristic impedance, outside diameter is ten point eight,
velocity factor is point six six and double screened braid, silver plated copper wire
rg two twenty-three by u has the characteristic impedance of fifty, outside diameter five
point five, velocity factor point six six and it is a double screened braid shield material
this module focuses on guided transmission media
coaxial cable connectors- to connect coaxial cable to devices, we need coaxial connectors
the most common type of connector used today is the bayonet-neil concelman or bnc connector
there are three types of bnc connectors- the bnc connector, used to connect the end of
the cable to a device, such as a tv set
the bnc-t connector, used in ethernet networks to branch out to a connection to a computer
or other device
the bnc terminator, used at the end of the cable to prevent the reflection of the signal
advantages- highly resistant to signal interference, can support greater cable length between network
devices, very robust
the disadvantages are, more expensive per foot and difficult to install
guided transmission media uses cabling system that guide the data signals along a specific
welcome to the session on unguided transmission media
as the satellite is positioned in a geosynchronous orbit, it is stationary relative to earth
and always stays over the same point on the ground
this is usually done to allow ground stations to aim antenna at a fixed point in the sky
the communication is carried through uplinks and downlinks
the uplink transmits the data to the satellite, and downlink receives the data from the satellite
the area shadowed by the satellite in which the information on data can be transmitted
and received is called the footprint
advantages- it is a single microwave relay station visible from any point of long distance
transmission and reception cost are independent of the distance between two points
capability to receive back its own transmission
signals are normally broadcast through the air, and thus are available to anyone who
disadvantages- satellite manufacturing is expensive, high cost of placing the satellite
into its orbit
necessary security measures are to be taken to prevent unauthorized tampering of information
infrared wave transmission- infrared waves with frequencies from three hundred gigahertz
to four hundred tera hertz can be used to short range communication
these frequencies are just below the visible light spectrum, infrared waves having high
frequencies cannot penetrate walls
these advantages characteristic prevents interferences between one system and another a short range
communication system in one room cannot be affected by another system in the next room
when we use infrared remote control, we do not interfere with the use of the remote by
has the device capable of preceding them
our neighbors
however, these same characteristics makes infrared signal useless for long range communication
in addition, we cannot use infrared waves outside a building, because the sun’s rays
contain infrared waves that can interfere with the communication
advantages- the waves are cheap, directional, can easily built
disadvantages include, waves do not pass through solid objects
applications, the infrared band almost four hundred tera hertz has an excellent potential
for data transmission
such a wide bandwidth can be used to transmit digital data with a very high data rate
the infrared data association irda in association for sponsoring the use of infrared waves has
unguided mediums are used for point to point connections between two devices, while unguided
established standards for using these signals for communication between devices, such as
keyboards, mouse, pcs and printers
infrared signals can be used for short range communication in a closed area using line
of sight propagation, this is widely used in tv remotes, garage doors and wireless speakers
bluetooth- bluetooth system is named after a danish king harald blatand, who is known
for his contribution to unification of tribes from denmark, norway and sweden
the main function of the bluetooth technology is used to connect various electronic devices
wirelessly to a system for the transferring of data
bluetooth is used to create a personal area network of pan or piconnect that <?>lets</?>
devices such as cell phones, hands free earphones, mouse, wireless keyboards etcetera to be connected
medium allow signals to be sent out informally across multiple areas, reaching a wide variety
by using bluetooth information from one device can be transferred to another device within
a range of ten meters
it uses radio signals that are omnidirectional and hence the devices need not be aligned
with each other
this technology has various functions and it is used commonly in the wireless communication
market
when bluetooth capable devices come in range of one another, the connections are set automatically
once the conversation has occurred, devices form a piconnect
once the piconnect is established, the member devices randomly hop frequencies in unison
so, <?>these tend</?> touch with one another and avoid other piconnects that maybe operating
of systems
in the same room
advantages- robustness, low complexity, low power requirements
bluetooth radio link uses fast acknowledgment and frequency hopping scheme
disadvantages- maximum data transmission rate is one mbps, not suitable for exchanging large
data files and folders
maximum range is thirty feet, hence the space is limited
applications- can be used to create pan with electronic devices, such as cell phones, pda,
wireless keyboards etcetera, can be used to transfer small files from one device to another,
when any other networks are not available
wi-fi- the term wi-fi stands for wireless fidelity, which is a powerful wireless communication
the most common application of wireless data communication is for mobile users
that is used by various electronic devices like smart phones, laptops, etcetera
in this set up a router works as a communication hub wirelessly, these networks allow users
to connect only within close proximity to a router
wi-fi is very common in networking applications, which affords portability wirelessly
the devices should be equipped with wireless network in the <?>face card</?> that is nic
to send and receive wi-fi signals
these networks need to be protected with passwords for the purpose of security, otherwise it
will access by others
advantages- allows developing low cost wireless networks
elimination of wires enables the devices to move from one location to another within range
those include people in car or airplanes, satellites, remote space, <?>props</?> and
disadvantages- weak security and vulnerable to attack
wi-fi signals are not confined to the boundaries of building and intruders can easily gain
access to the network
it is susceptible to interference from other devices operating in the same area such as
wireless phones, other wireless networks etcetera
applications- widely used for creating wireless lans and to provide wireless internet access
development of low cost networks for home and office
this module describes the important unguided transmission media used in networks
the data can be transmitted from source to destination with the help of wireless mediums,
such as radio waves, microwaves, satellites, infrared, bluetooth, etcetera
space shuttles
what are the methods used in each techniques, their advantages, disadvantages and applications
are discussed here
hope you enjoy this session, see you next time, until then bye
the unbounded or unguided media are not using any physical connectors between the two devices
communicating usually the transmission is sent through the atmosphere
we already know that a transmission medium can be considered as anything, which carries
wireless media are used when a physical obstruction or distance blocks are used with normal cable media
some commonly used unguided media for transmission include radio frequency propagation, microwave
transition, satellite transmission, infrared wave transmission, bluetooth and wi-fi
radio frequency or rf propagation- in radio frequency propagation, the signal is carried
over waves, which have frequencies in the range of radio frequency spectrum
mostly an audio broadcasting service, radio broadcast sound through the air as radio waves
radio uses a transmitter which is used to transmit the data in the form of radio waves
to a receiving antenna
to broadcast common programming, stations are associated with the radio networks, radio
broadcasting maybe done with the cable fm, the net and satellites
data from a source node to a destination node
a broadcast sends information over long distances at up to two mega bits per second, example
am, fm radio
radio waves are electromagnetic signals that are transmitted by an antenna
these waves have completely different frequency segments, and you will be ready to obtain
an audio signal by changing into a frequency segment
there are three types of <?>3 - 18</?> propagation, such as ground wave, ionospheric and line of sight
ground wave propagation follows the curvature of the earth, they have carrier frequencies
of up to two megahertz
am radio is an example of ground wave propagation
in ionospheric propagation, the signal wave bounces of the earth’s ionosphere layer
the data signals represented by computers and other electronic devices are transmitted
in the upper atmosphere
it operates in the frequency range of thirty to eighty five megahertz
as this type of propagation depends on the earth’s ionosphere, it changes with the
day timings and weather
line of sight propagation transmits exactly in the line of sight, the receiving station
must be in view of the transmitting station
it is sometimes called space waves or tropospheric propagation
it is limited by the curvature of the earth for ground based stations
generally, radio waves are omnidirection which means that they can travel in all directions
from the sources, so that all transmitter and receiver need not be carefully aligned physically
from one device to another in the form of electromagnetic energy, which is propagated
advantages- at low frequencies, radio waves pass through obstacles well
at high frequencies, radio waves tend to travel in straight lines and bounces off obstacles
disadvantages- due to radio’s ability to travel long distances, interferences between
users is a problem
applications- the omnidirectional characteristics of radio waves make them useful
for multicasting, in which there is one sender but many receivers
am and fm radio, television, maritime radio, cordless phones, and paging are examples of
multicasting
microwave transmission- electromagnetic waves having frequencies between one to three hundred
gigahertz are called microwaves, microwaves are unidirectional
through the transmission medium
when an antenna transmits microwaves, they can be narrowly focused
microwave transmission use microwave signals that travel a higher frequency, and are popularly
used for transmitting data over long distances
microwave communication uses parabolic antennas that are mounted on the tower, which could
be some kilometers away, but in line of sight
due to the long distance repeaters are used at regular intervals in between the transmitter
and the receiver to boost the signals
microwave communication makes use of lower gigahertz frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum
these frequencies are higher than radio frequencies and produce better throughput and performance
the directional parabolic antennas are used to send and receive signals in lower gigahertz
the two categories of transmission media are guided transmission media and unguided transmission media
range, these waves cannot bend or pass through obstacles
two types of antennas are used for microwave communications, parabolic dish and horn
a parabolic antenna works as a funnel, catching a wide range of waves and directing them to
a common point, in this way more of the signal is recovered than would be possible with a
single point receiver
a horn antenna looks like a gigantic scoop, outgoing transmissions are broadcast of a
system and deflected outward in a series of narrow parallel beams by the curved head
received transmissions are collected by the scooped shape of the horn in the manner similar
to the parabolic dish, and are deflected down into the system
advantages- suitable for long distance telephone communication, tv, etcetera
this module gives an overview of unguided or wireless transmission media
permits data transmission rate of about sixteen giga bits per second
it can carry thousands of voice signals at the same time
disadvantages- microwave towers can exchange data only if they have a clear line of sight
between them with no obstacles, such as buildings, slopes of trees in the way
signal absorption by the atmosphere
possibility of weather obstruction, cost is high to install
applications- microwaves, due to their unidirectional properties are very useful, when unicast,
that is one-to-one communication is needed between the sender and the receiver
they are used in cellular phones, satellite networks and wireless lans
satellite transmission- satellite transmission is done with the help of some artificial satellite
unlike the guided transmission media which uses caballing system, unguided media are wireless
used for communication
it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different
locations on earth
communication satellites are used for television, telephone, radio, internet and military applications
there are over two thousand communication satellites in earth’s orbit used by both
private and government organizations
the microwave relay station is placed in outer space, the satellites are launched either
by rockets or space shuttles carry them
these are positioned thirty six thousand kilometers above the equator, with an orbit speed that
exactly matches the rotation speed of the earth
it simply transports electromagnetic waves without using any physical conductor
welcome
content and facts
we often suffer from an overdose of data or too often the problems is that the knowledge
available is insufficient or poorly specified
the challenge here is to get hold of the information that is around and turn it into knowledge
by making it usable
this might involve for instance making tacit knowledge explicit, identifying gaps in the
knowledge already held, acquiring and integrating knowledge from multiple sources
example, different experts or distributed sources on the www and acquiring knowledge
from unstructured media
applications of internet- internet acts as a backbone for a variety of useful services,
no one actually owns the internet and no single person or organization controls the internet
important among them are explained here
they are e-mail, world wide web, interest telephony, internet relay chat, usenet newsgroups,
telnet and ftp, etcetera
e-mail- electronic mail or e-mail is the most well known and widely used internet service
it is a method of exchanging digital messages from another to one or more recipients through
a computer network
electronic mails enable internet users to send messages to other users, regardless of
the system they are using or their location in the world
internet based e-mails are also known as web mails, to send and receive e-mails one must
have an e-mail address
in its <?>entity</?>
e-mail systems allow to attach any format of data, such as text files, image files,
audio files, video files, program files, etcetera along with an email
world wide web or www- world wide web refers to the huge collection of information stored
in a number of computers around the world, which are connected over internet
information in the world wide web is represented in hypertext format
a hypertext document may contain text, images, animations, sound, video, etcetera, embedded
into a single page
it may also contain text which act as links to another document or to a different section
of the same document
the hypertext documents which are the part of www are stored on computers known as web servers
the internet is more of a concept rather than an actual tangible entity, and it relies on
internet users can access the information contained in the www using special application
softwares known as web browsers
internet telephony- internet telephony refers to the communication services that help the
internet users to speak to each other over internet
internet telephone system allows users to communicate either from computer to computer
or from computer to telephone
it provides a cheap and easy to use alternative to the conventional telephone systems
internet relay chat- internet relay chat is a common internet service in which participants
around the world can communicate to each other, by typing real time text messages
usually, a chat server provides many chat rooms with different chat topics or interest
a physical infrastructure that connects networks to other networks
a user can join a chat room of his own interest or even he can start a private chat with a
particular user
video chatting is relatively a development which allows users to chat over internet with
the help of a web camera
usenet newsgroups- usenet newsgroups are world wide text based electronic bulletin board
system, in which millions of internet users exchange information on a variety of topics
usenet messages are stored on usenet servers and the user has to log on to these servers
to access the information
telnet and ftp- telnet is a protocol that allows to log on to a remote computer on the internet
telnet helps a local computer to establish connection to a remote host computer and access
the internet has greatly changed the way people use computers and communicate today
its resources
ftp stands for file transfer protocol, it is a protocol used to transfer files between
computers on the internet
it allows internet users to transfer files from remote servers to their personal computers
internet service providers- an internet service provider also known as an isp or even as an
iap, internet access provider is a firm that offers subscribers access to the internet
this internet service provider maintains large runs of caballing and maintains network services
in order to transfer and deliver web content to those paying the subscription fee
typically, these internet service providers focus on dsl, cable modem, wireless and more
recently dedicated high speed interconnects, such as t one or fiber optic service, typically
many internet terms have become part of people’s everyday language, and email has added a whole
abbreviated fios
while far less common isp’s still offer dial-up internet service, which is gradually
became a phase out
all in all there are many different types of internet service providers and within each
every internet service provider there are often varying levels of services, coverage
as well as personal customer service, that comes attached with it
an internet service provider is a complete package of services, which should be researched
and considered before an internet service provider is selected
troubleshooting and internet connection- troubleshooting is a technical name given to identifying and
correcting problems in electronic equipments
new means through which people can communicate
an internet connection is always suspected to problems and it need lot of checks to correct
the errors
troubleshooting an internet connection is easy if you know the regular problems faced
in the connection
making sure you have correct ip information- make sure you have the correct ip scheme for
your network
this will include the ip address, subnet mask, default gateway and dns servers
there are a few ways you can see what ip addresses are being assigned, but generally for windows
nine x, windows two thousand and windows seven run the command, ip config slash all from
the command prompt
the internet is a worldwide collection of networked computers, which are able to exchange
if you have a router common examples would be one ninety two point one sixty eight point
zero point x, one ninety two point one sixty eight point one point x, or ten point zero
point zero point x
also make sure you have the correct subnet mask and default gateway ip address
with a router this is typically the ip address of your router
make sure you have the correct dns servers
possible causes for not getting an ip address assigned are defective cable, network card
or port on the router, make sure you are using all known working components
your router is not configured for dhcp which would automatically be assigning ip addresses,
but you need to have this working before proceeding
information with one another very quickly
basic ping text both by ip address and name, example ping one ninety two point one sixty
eight point one point one
if you get a reply then your connection to the router is working
if you don’t get a reply, then you need to double check your network card, cable,
port on the router
try pinging an external site by ip address
example, ping four point two point two point one
if you get a reply then you have a connection to the internet
if you don’t get a reply there are several things you can try
double check that the router is connecting to the internet typically you can access the
the internet in simple terms is a network of the interlinked computer networking worldwide,
to the session on internet and applications
router through your web browser and check its status
take the power off your dsl cable modem and router
plug the modem back in a wait a minute or so
plug the router back in and wait a minute or so
then restart your computer
try pinging an external site by name, example ping www dot yahoo dot com
if you get a reply then you have a connection to the internet and dns is working
if you don't get a reply, there are several things you can try
double check your dns entries
you many need to use the same dns ip address that your isp or router is using
which is accessible to the general public
on rare occasions your isp has problems with their dns servers
but, that is rare in comparison to mis-configured computers
if your ping test works, but you are having problems browsing sites on the internet
if you could ping external sites by both ip address and name, but cannot browse the web,
likely your web browser is mis-configured
double check that you don’t have an incorrect or not needed proxy server assigned
for the internet explorer, tools slash internet options slash connections tab lan settings button
uncheck both automatically detect settings and use a proxy server for your lan
introduction to world wide web- the world wide web is a system that makes exchange of
data on the internet easy and efficient
internet is a huge network of several different interlinked networks relating to business,
it consists of two basic components, the web server- a computer and software that stores
and distributes data to other computers throughout the internet and request the information
the web browser- software running on an individual's or client computer that request information
from the web server, and displays it in a manner of directed in the data file itself
www was introduced in nineteen eighty nine, it is the most popular and promising method
of accessing internet
it’s a huge repository of information stored on various web servers in hypertext format
an effectively designed hypertext document can help users rapidly locate the desired
type of information, from the vast amount of information on the web
hypertext documents enable this by using a series of links
government, academics and even smaller domestic networks
a link is an item in a hypertext document which connects the document with another document
that provides more detailed information
hypertext documents on internet which is also known as web pages may integrate different
types of information, such as text, image, sound, video etcetera into a single page
special languages known as markup languages are used to create hypertext documents
html is the most popular and widely used markup language
web servers- web servers are computers and software’s that stores and distributes data
to other computers throughout the internet, that requires the information
web servers are responsible for accepting http request from web clients, which are known
as web browsers, and serving them http responses along with optional data contents, which usually
these networks enable the internet to be used for various important functions which include
are web pages such as html documents and linked objects
although web servers programs differ in detail, they shall share some basic common features
http- every web server program operates by accepting http request from the client and
providing an http response to the client
the http response usually consists of an html document, but can also be a raw file, an image
or some other type of document
if some error is found in client request or while trying to serve it, a web server has
to send an error response, which may include some custom html or text messages to better
explain the problems
logging- usually web servers have also the capability of logging some detailed information
several means of communications like the file transfer, online chat, sharing of the documents,
about client request and server responses to log files
this allows the web master to collect statistics by running log analyzes on logged files
authentication- optional authentication request, request of user name and password before allowing
access to resources
content compression- to reduce the size of the responses
bandwidth throttling- to limit the speed of responses in order to not saturate the network
and to be able to serve more clients
web browsers- a web browser is a software application for retrieving, presenting, and
traversing information resources on the world wide web
it acts as an interface between the user and the inner details of web
etcetera
web browsers are also known as web clients
the main functions of web browsers are contact a web server and send a request for information
receive the information and display it in a user convenient manner
although browsers are primarily intended to use the world wide web, they can also be used
to access information provided by web servers in private networks or files in file systems
the major web browsers are firefox, chrome, internet explorer, opera and safari
the first web browser was invented in nineteen ninety by sir tim berners-lee
it was called world wide web and was later renamed as nexus
the primary purpose of a web browser is to bring information resources to the user, allow
them to view the information and then access other information
history of internet- the internet was the first result of some machinery thinking by
this process begins with the user inputs a uniform resource locator or url
for example, www dot university of calicut dot info into the browser
on receiving the url, the browser locates the desired web server, transfers its content
to the local computer, and display it on the local computer screen
internet protocols- internet protocols are a set of methods or roles that govern the
data transfer between computers on internet
it is the set of technical specifications that enable computers to exchange information,
irrespective of their hardware and software architectures
the most commonly used internet protocols are transmission control protocol, internet
protocol that is tcp ip
people in the early nineteen sixties, which show great potential value in allowing computers
file transfer protocol ftp, hyper text transfer protocol http and telnet
the internet is based on tcp ip protocols, it is the collection of protocols that govern
the way data travels from one system to another across the internet
ftp is a protocol that enables the exchange of files between computers on internet, it
works on client server principle
http is a set of rules that governs the transfer of hyper text data between two or more computers
it enable the user to receive a wide variety of resources, such as text, sound, pictures,
etcetera
telnet is a protocol that enables a computer to log on to a remote server
it helps a local computer to establish connection to a remote host computer and access its resources
to share information on research and development in scientific and military fields
internet protocol address or ip address- internet protocol address or ip address is a unique
number used to identify each host computers connected to the internet
there are currently two versions of internet protocol ip, ipv four and a new version called
ipv six, ipv six is an evolutionary upgrade to the internet protocol
ipv six will co-exist with the other ipv four for some time
an ip version four address consists of four sections separated by dots
to two fifty five
ip address represents both a computer and the network to which the computer is connected
which sections of the ip address represent the network and which section represents the
<?>2 - 47</?> of mit first proposed a global network of computers in nineteen sixty two
the internet is a massive network of networks or rather a networking infrastructure
machine, will depend on the class of ip address assigned to the network
ip addresses are divided into five classes, namely class a, b, c, d and class e
class a ip addresses have the first octet value with in the range one to one twenty
seven, that is one point the three octets to one twenty seven point the three octets
these ip addresses are generally assigned to major service providers
class b ip addresses have the first octet value with in the range of one twenty eight
to one ninety one
organizations with very large networks such as large business firms, universities, etcetera
are assigned with class b ip addresses
the first two octets in a class b address describe the network and the remaining two
and moved over to the defense advanced research project agency that is the darpa in late nineteen
represent the host computer
class c ip addresses have the first octet value with in the range one ninety two to
two twenty three
here the first three octets represents the network and the remaining one determines the
host machine
class c ip addresses are generally assigned to small networks
there are over one million class c networks with a capacity of two fifty four hosts per network
class d ip addresses will have the first octet value in between two twenty four to two thirty
nine, these addresses are reserved for multicasting
class e addresses with first octet value in between two forty to two forty seven are reserved
sixty two to head the work develop it
for future use
domain name systems- all computers on internet are assigned with a unique identification
number known as ip address
theoretically, if we want to access a website, we have to know and type the corresponding
web servers ip address in the browser
but, it will be very difficult to remember the ip address as they are strings of numbers
to solve this issue, each web servers are designed with unique names known as domain
name
a domain name is simply a string which acts as a substitute to ip address
domain names consists of a series of words separated by dots
leonard klein rock of mit and later ucla developed the theory of packet switching, which was
the last part of domain name is called top level domain and represent the type of organization
holding the name
major categories of top level domains are com for commercial organizations, also used
by noncommercial organizations such as individuals, government agencies, etcetera
dot gov for government organizations and agencies, dot edu for educational institutions and organizations
dot org for non-commercial organizations and dot mil for military networks
even though domain name makes it easy for the internet users to identify and locate
desired servers
the internet still use the ip addresses to send and receive data
so, there must be some mechanism to translate domain names into ip addresses
to form the basis of internet connections
a server known as domain name system dns servers this purpose
uri and url- universal resource identifier (uri) is an identifier, which locates a resource
on the world wide web
it includes a uri scheme, authority, path, query and fragment syntax
a uri identifies a resource either by location or a name or both
the term uniform resource locator or url refers to the subset of uris that, in addition to
identifying a resource, provides a means of locating the resource by describing its primary
access mechanisms, example, its network location
the url defines how the resource can be obtained
we use url’s everyday in the form of http colon double slash university of calicut dot
lauren streubert of mit connected a massachusetts computer with a california computer in nineteen
info, etcetera
but a url doesn’t have to be an http url, it can be ftp double slash university of calicut
dot info
a uri is an identifier for some resource, but a url gives you specific information as
to obtain that resource
generally if the url describes both the location and name of a resource, the term to use is
uri
the client server model- the term client server refers to a popular model for computer networking
that utilizes client and server devices, each designed for specific purposes
the client server model can be used on the internet as well as local area networks lans
sixty five over dial up telephone lines
examples of client server systems on the internet include web browsers and web servers
ftp clients and servers and the dns
the client server model distinguishes between applications as well as devices
network clients make request to a server by sending messages, and servers respond to their
clients by acting on each request and returning results
one server generally supports numerous clients and multiple servers can be networked together
in a poll, to handle the increased processing load as the number of clients grows
a client computer and a server computer are usually two separate devices, each customized
for their designed purposes
for example, a web client works best with a large screen display, while a web server
it showed the feasibility of wide area networking, but also showed that the telephone lines circuit
does not need any display at all, and can be located anywhere in the world
however, in some cases a given device can function both as a client and a server for
the same application
likewise, a device that is a server for one application can simultaneously act as a client
to other servers for different applications
some of the most popular applications on the internet follow the client server model including
email, ftp and web services
each of these clients features a user interface either graphic or text based, and a client
application that allows the user to connect to servers
in the case of email and ftp, users enter a computer name or sometimes an ip address
switching was adequate and hence <?>3 - 37</?> packet switching theory was confirmed
into the interface to set up connections to the server
email and email protocols- electronic mail or email is the most well known and widely
used internet service
it’s a method of exchanging digital messages from another to one or more recipients through
a computer network
basically a protocol is a standard method used at each end of a communication channel
in order to properly transmit information in order to deal with email, you must use
a mail client to access a mail server
the mail client and mail server can exchange information with each other using a variety
of protocols
roberts moved over to darpa in nineteen sixty six and developed his plan for arpanet
important among them are listed here, imap protocol- imap or internet message access
protocol is a standard protocol for accessing email from your local server
imap is a client server protocol in which email is received and held for you by your
internet server
as this requires only a small data transfer this works well even over a slow connection,
such as a modem
only if you requested to read a specific email message, will it be downloaded from the serve
you can also create a manipulate folders or mail boxes on the server, delete messages,
etcetera
imap is the newer protocol and oriented toward a connected mode of operation
the internet then known as arpanet was brought online in nineteen sixty nine under a contract
it connects millions of computers together globally forming a network in which any computer
the standard imap procedure is to leave messages on the server instead of retrieving copies,
so email is only accessible when online
imap is most suited to a world of always on connections, particularly the fast connections
offered by broadband mechanism
pop three protocol- the pop or post office protocol three provides a simple standardized
way for users to access mail boxes and download messages to their computers
when using the pop protocol, all your email messages will be downloaded from the mail
server to your local computer
you can choose to leave copies of your emails on the server as well
the advantage is that once your messages are downloaded, you can cut the internal connections
laid by the advanced research project agency, which initially connected four major computers
and read your email at your leisure without incurring further communication cost
smtp protocol- the smtp or simple mail transfer protocol is used by the mail transfer agent
or mta to deliver emails to the recipient's mail server
the smtp protocol can only be used to send emails not to receive them
depending on the <?>network wise</?> settings, you may only be able to use the smtp protocol
under certain conditions
search engines- a search engine is the software program or script available through the internet,
that searches documents and files for keywords and returns the results of any files containing
those keywords
today there are many different search engines available on the internet, each with there
at universities in the south western us
own abilities and features
the first search engine ever developed is considered archie, which was used to search
for ftp files and the first text based search engineers considered <?>baronica</?>
the search results are generally presented in a line of research often referred to as
search engine result pages serps
the information maybe a present in web pages, images, information and other type of files
one can search the internet for any kind of information with the help of search engine
on the internet a search engine is a coordinated set of programs that include, a spider also
called a "crawler" or a "bot" that explores the internet by following hyperlinks, starting
with a core group of "seed" urls covering major hubs
ucla, stanford research institute, ucsb and the university of utah
or a program that creates a huge index or database from the pages that have been read
a program that receives your search request, compares it to the entries in the index, and
returns results to you
google is the most widely used search engine in the world capturing about ninety two percentage
of search user’s world wide
yahoo and bing came in second at just over two percentage each
duckduckgo has gained some popularity due to their focused on protecting users private
search data
other popular search engines in the world are baidu for china, yandex in russia and
naver south korea
by nineteen seventy one many more new notes were added to this network
different search engine approaches- major search engines such as google, bing, and yahoo
index the content of a large portion of the web and allow users to query their index to
find relevant pages
specialized content search engines may be more selective about what part of the web
is crawled and indexed
country specific search engines may prioritize in-language websites over english websites
individual web sites, especially larger corporate sites, may use a search engine to index and
retrieve the content of just their own site
some of the major search engines companies licensed or sell their search engines for
use on individual sites
the early internet was used by computer experts, engineers, scientists and librarians
we started with the introduction to internet, which is a network of networks
the internet has started as arpanet and later grown up into a global network
then we discussed some of the important applications of internet and the internet service providers
the world wide web which is a repository of web information, the different types of protocols
used for internet and search engines were all also discussed
hope you enjoy this session, see you next time, bye
e-mail was adapted for arpanet by ray tomlinson of bbn in nineteen seventy two, he picked
the “at the rate” symbol to link the user name and address
the arpanet computers were switched over to tcp ip in nineteen eighty three
in nineteen eighty six the national science foundation funded nsfn net as across country
fifty six kbps <?>backboned</?> for the internet
can communicate with any other computer as long as they are both connected to the internet
they maintained their sponsorship for nearly a decade setting rules for its not commercial
government and research uses
by nineteen eighty seven, there were nearly thirty thousand host on the internet
the original arpanet protocol had been limited to thousand host, but the adoption of tcp
ip standard made large number of host possible
in nineteen eighty nine another significant event took place in making the nets easier to use
tim berners-lee and others at the european laboratory of particle physics proposed a
new protocol for information distribution
this protocol which became the world wide web in nineteen ninety one was based on hyper
text, a system of embodying links in text to link to other text
unlike online services which are centrally controlled, the internet is decentralized
since the internet was initially funded by the government, it was originally limited
to research, education and government uses
commercial uses were prohibited unless they directly serve the goals of research and education
this policy continued until the early nineties when independent commercial networks began to grow
it then became possible to road traffic across the country from one commercial site to another
without passing through the government funded nsfnet, internet backbone
nineteen ninety brought about the first commercial dial-up internet provider, same year arpanet
cease to exist
nineteen ninety five is often consider the first year the web became commercialized
since then the internet has undergone several technological evolution that made it easily
by design
accessible from any part of the world
nowadays we can use internet for a variety of purposes
internet as a global network- the internet has become one of the most loved and used
sources of information
the world wide web’s popularity is phenomenal, websites and web pages are a way of allowing
us all to share our knowledge, interest and experiences
the benefits of usage of internet are to find things, whether looking for a local taxi company,
a mobile, hair dresser or even some income protection insurance, the internet is a vast
source of knowledge
we are all guilty of running to the mercy of google, whenever we want to get our hands
each internet computer called a host is independent, its operators can choose which internet services to use
on some information first
the internet allows us to have information right at our finger tips whenever we need it
downfalls of using the internet to gain knowledge- despite reason tabloid debates regarding privacy
and what you can and cannot say on the internet, the truth still remains that the web offers
a place for freedom of speech
because of this freedom to express and share knowledge, you will find many inaccuracies
when relaying on the internet for information and knowledge
this can be a big problem if you are using the information, you find for college course
work or even to report back to your <?>boos</?>
sudden sites like wikipedia back up their information with facts and evidence, they
and which local services to make available to the global internet community
even have the facility for reader input and modifications, if a reader feels the content
is inaccurate
but, sites such as these are very rare, and it is up to our own research skills and common
sense to distinguish between the fact and the fiction
how to use the internet correctly when looking for information- as the information on the
internet has been put there by us imperfect humans, you need to ensure you only use the
information you are presented with as a guide
for example, if you are looking for legal information on equity release, use various
sites to gain an overall understanding of the subject
by consulting many different websites, you will be able to <?>ion</?> out any contradictory
remarkably this anarchy by design works exceedingly well
﻿hello, welcome to the session on “online education”
simultaneous and two-way communication this is commonly supported by media such as
video conferencing, virtual classrooms and chat sessions the most familiar form of
synchronous electronic communication is real time two-way text-based online chat,
which is widely used in e-learning more sophisticated forms of synchronous instruction
include virtual classrooms, which use information and communication technologies to mimic a
traditional classroom environment this may involve video conferencing or the use of shared
electronic white boards, which allow learning materials to be created and modified in real time,
either by the instructor or the learners learners and teachers experience synchronous
e-learning as more social and avoid frustration, by asking and answering questions in real time
synchronous sessions help e-learners feel like participants rather than isolates
in the way people learned the future of education in general and college education particular
asynchronous e-learning- as you are familiar with the use of email which is also a two-way
communication here the flexibility is that the sender and receiver of the message need not be
online at the same time you can check your email at your convenient time, thus asynchronous means
you need not be online at the same time this asynchronous e-learning is commonly facilitated
by media, such as email and discussion boards supports work relation among learners and the
teachers, even when participants cannot be online at the same time, it is thus a key component of
flexible learning asynchronous instruction allows participants to control their timetables and fit
learning around their other commitments, this is a major bonus especially for adult learners
asynchronous e-learning makes it possible for learners to log on to an e-learning environment at
any time, and download documents or send messages to teachers or peers
will be of more access, more educational choices and new fields in educational research
students may spend more time refining their contributions which are generally
considered more thoughtful compared to synchronous communication
many of the technologies used in asynchronous e-learning,
also permit two-way communication between learners and instructors, or multi-directional
collaborative communication among learners themselves blended learning- in blended learning,
e-learning is being combined with traditional classroom methods, and independent study to create
a new hybrid teaching methodology many use terms like hybrid, mixed
or integrative to describe the same trend in a blended learning course for example,
students might attend a class taught by a teacher in a traditional classroom setting,
while also independently completing online components of the course outside the classroom
online education is synchronous if the teacher and student have some direct simultaneous contact
in this case in class time maybe either replaced or supplemented by online learning experiences
and students would learn about the same topics online as they do in class, that is the online and
in-person learning experiences, would parallel and complement one another the blended learning
will have the essential requirement of in-person classroom activities facilitated by a teacher
online learning materials provided through a website, bog, or lms structured independent study
and assignments both face-to-face and online mode blended learning can provide the convenient speed
and cost effectiveness of e-learning with the personal touch of traditional learning
students can prepare for consolidate and recall classroom experiences online, while gaining the
benefits of interaction with teachers and students via an actual or virtual classroom
student learning and retention rates improve without sacrificing the convenience,
for instance, a teacher might meet with students in a chat forum for a discussion
cost effectiveness and customization of self-paced, web-based coursework
individual versus group- individualized e-learning refers to situations, where an individual learner
is accessing learning resources, such as a database or course content offline
or online via an intranet or internet a typical example of this is a learner
studying alone or conducting some research on the internet, local network, or using a cd or dvd in
group based e-learning refers to situations, where groups of learners are working together in real
time or with time delay via an intranet or the internet it may include text-based conferencing,
online discussion forum, electronic mailing, and one or two-way audio and video conferencing
examples of this include learners engaged in a real-time chat or an audio video conference
self-paced versus instructor lead- in self-paced approach the e-learning courseware is usually
another example of synchronous distance learning is a teacher delivering a lecture
made available through an online learning platform or on cd-rom learners are free to
choose the learning activities, and learn at their own pace based on individual needs and
interests e-learning content is developed according to a set of learning objectives,
and is delivered using different media elements such as text, graphics, audio and video it must
provide as much learning support is possible through explanations, examples, interactivity,
feedback, <?>glossaries</?>* etcetera, in order to make learners self sufficient
whereas in instructor lead the course is scheduled and led by an instructor and or facilitator
through an online learning platform e-learning content for individual study can be integrated
with instructors, lectures, individual assignments and collaborative activities among learners
learners, facilitators and instructors can use communication tools such as emails,
at a scheduled time, with students watch it simultaneously distance learning also allows
discussion forums, chats, polls, whiteboards and application sharing and audio and video
conferencing to communicate and work together at the end a final step typically includes an
exercise or assessment to measure learning communication tools- as you are aware
modern technology provides us with a plethora of options for communicating the most common
communication tool used in e-learning include email, instant messaging and blogging email-
email stands for electronic mail, email is defined as a transmission of messages over communication
networks there are many email service providers and the most famous ones are yahoo mail and gmail
exchanging mail messages with a mentor or peer is an e-learning experience
instant messaging im- instant messaging is the exchange of text messages through a software
application in real time instant messaging allows learners to chat with one another
for asynchronous learning, where instructor and learner do not meet in time or space
through text messages this has become very popular as here everything is performed in a
faster more reliable and cohesive manner instant messaging helps teachers to create
subject specific groups for exchange of information and sharing of resources
instant messaging applications like whatsapp are extensively used by teaching community
as reliable communication tool chat- chat is synchronous communication tool
facilitating online communication this tool helps teachers and learners to schedule a discussion
on a particular question or theme, and later save the chat discussion for later use
the chat tool is an integrated tool in all the lms and there are many standalone chat applications
update on an ongoing basis a blog is a frequently updated online personal journal or diary
for instance, a student may go to a website to read or watch the week’s lectures at any point
it’s a place to express yourself to the world and to share your thoughts and your passions
in blogs entries are commonly displayed in reverse chronological order most blogs are interactive
allowing visitors to leave comments and even message each other, via widgets on the blogs
and it is this interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites
many blogs provide commentary or news on a particular subject,
others function as more personal online diaries a typical blog combines text,
images and links to other blogs, web pages and other media related to its topic the ability
of readers to leave comments in an interactive format is an important part of many blogs
most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art, art blog, photographs, photo blog,
videos, video blogging and music mp three blog, and audio podcasting collaboration tools-
during the week students may use email to submit assignments to the teacher or ask questions
all around the globe, we are witnessing the transition towards collaborative learning
the benefits of collaborative learning are immense, it lets the learners gain
from the experience of their peers and help them acquire and retain information
in a more involved and engaged way thus, we see most of the e-learning is also social,
the learners learn through collaboration with peers in smaller or larger groups
the e-learning technology offers a number of collaboration tools to learn from one another,
to work on assignments, projects in groups and the like some of the popular collaboration tools
include chat, forum, wiki, online groups, audio video conferencing,
social bookmarking and social networking collaborative learning forums promote learner
interaction through message boards, where students can post questions and answers, text chat or
asynchronous learning opens up enormous possibilities by divorcing education from the
online education is electronically supported learning that relies on the internet for
forums, where learners can communicate outside the main classroom and threaded discussions,
where facilitators and students can discuss a given topic and review each other's responses
wiki- a wiki is a collaborative website that collects and organizes content,
created and revised by its users the most well known example is wikipedia,
wiki’s are a way to grow a knowledge base around a particular content area be it best practices in
a particular field or how to use a specific piece of software there are many software which help to
create online wiki and one of the most famous one among that is wordpress wiki is also a feature
available in all the learner management system in an e-learning context, wiki permits teachers
to give many kind of task to the learners to collaborate and create content on any
topic wiki platforms are used extensively to create and share open educational resources
constraints of time as well as place teaching in a digital age- teaching method
social bookmarking- a social bookmarking service is a centralized online service, which enables
users to add annotate, edit and share bookmarks of web documents social bookmarking websites
enhance and improve the learning experiences by encouraging group collaboration they also help
in organizing and saving web resources faster and easier for students
social bookmarking services offer greater scope for research, integration
and collaboration compared to the more traditional bookmarking applications, such as browsers which
offer limited functionality there are many services which are available freely for crediting
and sharing social bookmarks, and most famous among them are diigo, delicious and stumbleupon
teachers can create social bookmarks of resources
chapter-wise and invite other teachers to contribute and annotate
with no use of technology is not online learning, but pure face-to-face teaching
the social bookmarks thus created can be shared with the learners, and teachers can also give
assignments to learners to collaboratively build social bookmarks related to a particular topic
social networking sites- social networking site is the phrase used to describe any website that
enables users to create public profiles within that website, and from relationships with
other users of the same website who access their profile social networking sites can
be used to describe community based websites, online discussion forums,
chat rooms and other social spaces online examples include facebook, twitter, linkedin,
google plus, etcetera social networking can be used effectively for e-learning by creating
specific interest groups the learners within this group can share information, photographs, videos,
graphics related to a particular topic this can also be used by teachers to collaborate in
however, teaching without any technology is very rare these days, at least in formal education
generating and sharing resources online with ace, thereby, facilitating learning web conferencing-
web conferencing is highly interactive internet based applications with
a rich collaboration feature set example audio video from presenters and
learners, application sharing, white boarding and markup tools, breakout rooms, bowling, quizzing,
hand raising and emoticon responses, slides and media, website tours, public or private text chat
it is capable of scaling form small groups to hundreds or thousands of simultaneous users
in synchronous e-learning we refer to web conferencing web conferencing technologies
offer tremendous potential for robust interactivity and collaboration through
their versatility and rich feature options there are many online tools for organizing video,
web conferencing to facilitate collaborative learning, applications like bigbluebutton
then there is a use of technology as a classroom aid which may or may not be online learning
content creation tools or authoring tools- an e-learning content authoring tool is
a software package, which developers use to create and package e-learning content,
deliverable to the end users according to wikipedia dot org, a
content authoring tool is a software application used to create multimedia content
typically for delivery on the world wide web content-authoring tools may also create content
in other file formats so the training can be delivered on a cd-compact disc,
or in other formats for various different uses the category of content-authoring tools includes
html, flash, and various types of e-learning authoring tools thus, e-learning authoring
tools are a class of products designed for people, who need to create online educational or
training courses, that are deployed from a standard cloud-based learning management system
for instance an instructor using a projector, and powerpoint slides would not be using online
many programs can be considered authoring tools including flash and powerpoint however, only
a small group of programs specifically include support for e-learning content standards, such as
‘scorm’ sharable content object reference model there are many propriety as well as
open source authoring tools available currently in the market
some of the most famous propriety authoring tools are elucidate, lectora,
there are also many open sourcing authoring tools which have many features
they are learner activity management system lams, adapt, xerte and exelearning
in addition to these com compatible authoring tools there are many specific applications,
necessary for creating content such as image editing, video editing, audio editing
learning but, students being directed to use a device such as a laptop,
and animation tools to create multimedia e-content currently, most of the lms have its own
inbuilt authoring tools to create e-content, due to the convergence of the software features
short descriptions of the popular open source authoring tools are given in the following section
adapt- the adapt authoring tool is an application to allow you to quickly build responsive
e-learning content it is accessed through a web browser, you can create an account, login, create
courses and add assets, components and extensions you can peer review and publish your e-learning
content from the authoring tool lams- learner activity management system lams is a revolutionary
new tool for designing, managing and delivering online collaborative learning activities
it provides teachers with highly intuitive visual authoring environment for creating sequence of
learning activities xerte- xerte is a fully featured e-learning development environment
tablet, or mobile phone to look at a website during a classroom lesson would be a form of
for creating rich interactivity xerte is aimed at developers of interactive content,
who will create sophisticated content with some scripting and xerte can be used to
extend the capabilities of xerte online tool kits with new tools for content authors
xerte online tool kits is a server based suit of tools for content authors e-learning materials
can be authored quickly and easily, using browser based tools with no programming required
xerte online tool kit is aimed at content authors, who will assemble content using simple wizards
content authors can easily collaborate on projects xerte online tool kits can be extended
by developers using xerte exe learning- the exe project developed a freely available
open source authoring application to access teachers and academics in the publishing of
web content, without the need to become proficient in html or xml markup
online learning but, the classroom would remain the main means of delivery
resources authored in exe can be exported in ims content package, scom
one point two or ims common cartridge formats or as simple self-contained web pages
delivery and distribution tools- there are many options to deliver e-learning today
most common approach is to deliver online learning using a learner management system,
which has so many e-learning tools and technologies integrated in one place the
other approach gaining popularity currently is massive open online course ‘mooc’ format
a massive open online course (mooc) is a model for delivering learning e-content online
to any person who wants to take a course, with no limit on attendance
in addition to these two approaches, e-learning can also be delivered as flipped learning in
which the typical lecture and homework elements of a course are reversed web quest is an
however, this could be considered a sub-branch of online learning called blended learning
inquiry oriented lesson format, in which most or all the information that learners work with
comes from the web the e-learning could also be delivered or distributed through websites
as webcast, podcast, epub, streaming video, webinars, virtual tours and games
epub- wikipedia defines epub as an ebook file format with the extension epub that
can be downloaded and read on devices like smart phones, tablets, computers or e-readers
it is a free and open standard published by the international digital publishing forum
idpf the term is short for electronic publication, and sometimes tiled epub
sigil is an open source epub authoring tool and caliber is an open source epub reader
podcasting- podcasting is a form of audio broadcasting on the internet the audio files
are developed and distributed using <?>rss</?> to the computers of subscribed users
blended learning- here the definitions are a little less precise and is called blended learning, which in
teacher-student interaction and the distribution of class materials online education comes in many
these files may then be uploaded to digital music or multimedia players like the ipod
a podcast can be easily created from a digital audio file the podcaster first
saves the file as an mp three and then uploads it to the website of a service provider vodcasting that
is video on demand casting is the same principle as podcasting with the addition of video
podcasting or vodcasting allows educators to reach students using a medium that are accustomed to
it can be used to interact with students and parents beyond the school hours and can be a great
facilitator to increase student engagement student created podcasts, vodcasts gives
students the opportunity to enhance their organization communication and technology skills
record classroom lectures provides supplemental information, provide review sessions, record
classroom discussions, interview with experts, student projects are some of the uses of podcasts
general means a combination of face-to-face, teaching and the significant use of online
therefore, podcast is versatile medium for delivering e-learning specifically audio content
audio or video streaming- streaming audio or video is content send in
compressed form over the internet and displayed by the viewer in real time
with streaming video or streaming media, a web user does not have to wait to download
a file to play it instead the media is sent in a continuous stream of data and displayed
as it arrives the services offered by youtube are valued by e-learning providers world over
many institutions have created their own exclusive channels for providing their e-content to the end
users using youtube e-learning professionals used to make their e-learning courses more interactive
fun and informative using youtube in fact, it has the power to transform
a potentially dull or complicated subject matter into an overall exciting and engaging e-learning
learning, especially outside the classroom, this can take a number of forms flipped classroom-
experience e-learning providers like khan academy uses youtube extensively in delivering their
e-content mooc- massive open online course ‘mooc’ is a new approach to delivering e-learning
mooc is a model for delivering e-learning content online to any person who wants to take a course
with no limit or attendance e-learning standards- according to iso, standards can be defined as
"documented agreements containing technical specifications or other precise criteria
to be used consistently as rules, guidelines, or definitions of characteristics, to
ensure that materials, products, processes and services are fit for their purpose"
the goal of standards is to provide fixed data structures and communication
protocols for learning objects and cross system workflows this enables interoperability between
applications such as learning management system lms or in-house developed content
a flipped classroom is one where student do preparation online before a classroom session,
by providing uniform communication guidelines that can be used throughout the design development, and
delivery of learning objects there have been a number of efforts worldwide to develop standards
for learning object interoperability the standard supports interoperability,
durability, manageability, reusability and accessibility these standards focus on
content metadata, content packaging and runtime communication to support tracking of student’s
activities to this end there are several organizations working towards standards and
to make sure learning content is interoperable with various learning management technologies
in recent years group like the aviation industry, computer based training cbt committee, aicc, the
ims global learning consortium, the institute of electrical and electronics engineers, the
alliance for remote instructional authoring and distribution networks for europe, the dublin core
for instance, watching a pre-recorded video or lecture and online reading
shareable content object reference model and can core have developed specifications
or guidelines for various aspects of learning object development and use
massive open online course (mooc) - a massive open online course mooc is an online course that has
open access and interactive participation by means of the web moocs provide participants with course
materials that are normally used in a conventional education setting such as examples, lectures,
videos, study materials and problem sets apart from this moocs offer interactive user forums,
which are extremely useful in building a community for students, <?>41 - 30</?>* and professors
generally moocs do not change tuition fees or provide academic credit, some of the famous mooc
providers are coursera and udacity the indian mooc initiative is known as swayam
coursera- coursera is an online education provider that offers online courses, popularly known as
hybrid learning- hybrid learning is one where the whole classroom experience has been redesigned to
moocs or massive open online courses from top universities around the world currently, it has
one hundred and fifty such university partners from twenty nine countries around the world
coursera has also started partnering with companies like ibm, google and pwc, such
companies are also launching courses on coursera coursera has two main products- online courses
and specializations specializations basically consist of a sequence of online courses,
designed to enable you to master a particular topic some specializations have a capstone
project as the last course in the sequence not all courses are part of specializations,
but a majority of courses that are newly launched are part of a specialization
udacity is a for-profit educational organization founded by sebastian thrun, david stevens
focus on what the instructor thinks is best done online, and what is best done face-to-face in
and mike sokolowski offering massive open online courses moocs according to
thrun, the origin of the name udacity comes from the company's desire to be "audacious for you,
the student" while it originally focused on offering university style courses,
it now focuses more on vocational courses for professionals udacity is the outgrowth
of free computer science classes offered in two thousand eleven, through stanford university
swayam- swayam is a program initiated by government of india and designed
to achieve the three cardinal principles of education policy, with access, equity
and quality the objective of this effort is to take the best teaching learning resources to all,
including the most disadvantaged swayam seeks to bridge the digital divide for students who have
<?>hitherto remained</?> untouched by the digital revolution, and have not been able to join the
hybrid learning students may spend fifty percent or more of their time learning online
mainstream of the knowledge economy this is done through an indigenous developed
it platform, that facilitates hosting of all the courses taught in classrooms from
ninth class till post graduation to be accessed by anyone, anywhere, at any time
all the courses are interactive prepared by the best teachers in the country,
and are available free of cost to the residents in india more than one thousand specially chosen
faculty and teachers from across the country have participated in preparing these courses the
courses hosted on swayam are in four quadrants video lecture, specially prepared reading material
that can be downloaded or printed, self assessment tests through tests and quizzes, and an online
discussion forum for clearing the doubts steps have been taken to enrich the learning
experience by using audio, video and multimedia and state of the art, pedagogy or technology
lastly, fully online learning where students do not come to campus at all,
in order to ensure best quality content are produced and delivered nine national coordinators
have been appointed, they are aicte for self-paced and international courses, nptel for engineering,
ugc for non-technical post graduation education, cec for undergraduate education,
ncrt and neos for school education, ignou for out of the school students,
iimb for management studies and nitttr for teacher training program
swayam platform is indigenously developed by ministry of human resource development mhrd,
and all india council for technical education aicte with the help of microsoft, and would
be ultimately capable of hosting two thousand courses, and eighty thousand hours of learning,
covering school, undergraduate, postgraduate, engineering, law and other professional courses
it’s time to summarize this session we started with the
but study entirely online, which is one form of distance education characteristics of online
discussion of education through internet then the characteristics of online education
were discussed, the different methods for teaching in digital medium, such as flipped, blended and
hybrid learning was also seen the different approaches of learning, the communication,
collaboration and authoring tools etcetera were discussed in detail the module ends
with a discussion on the different types of e-learning and teaching methods a picture of
the popular online courses was also given well, thank you for watching today’s program good bye
education- there are many terms for online education, some of them are virtual education,
names and the variety of styles, computer based training, web-based training, internet-based
internet based education, web-based education and education via computer mediated communication
the web edu project uses a definition of online education that is based on desmond keegan’s
nineteen eighty eight definition of distance education hence online education is characterized
by the separation of teachers and learners which distinguishes it from face-to-face education
the influence of an educational organization which distinguishes it from self-study and
private tutoring the use of a computer network to present or distribute some educational content
the provision of two-way communication via a computer network so that students
may benefit from communication with each other, teachers and staff
advantages of online teaching and learning- the minimum requirement for students to participate
in an online course is access to a computer, the internet and the motivation to succeed in a
training, online training, e-learning or electronic learning, m-learning or mobile
non-traditional classroom online courses provide an excellent method of course delivery unbound by
time or location, allowing for accessibility to instruction at anytime from anywhere
learners find the online environment a convenient way to fit education into their busy lives
the ability to access a course from any computer with internet access twenty four hours a day,
seven days a week is a tremendous incentive for many of the students
some of the main advantages of online learning include, convenience- twenty four by seven access
enhanced learning- research shows the increased depth of understanding and retention of
course content, more meaningful discussions, emphasis on writing skills, technology skills,
and life skills like time management, independence, and self-discipline
learning, computer aided distance education, etcetera are some of them a few years ago online
leveling of the playing field- students can take more time to think and reflect
before communicating, shy students tend to thrive online, anonymity of the online environment
interaction- increased student-to-teacher and student-to-student interaction and discussion,
a more student-centered learning environment, less passive listening and more active learning,
a greater sense of connectedness, synergy innovative learning- student-centered approaches,
increased variety and creativity of learning activities, address different learning styles,
changes and improvements can translate to on-ground courses as well
improved administration- time to examine student work more thoroughly, ability to document and
record online interactions, ability to manage grading online savings- accommodate more
students, increased student satisfaction, which is equal to higher retention and fewer repeats
education was unthinkable, now it is a reality, and it has expanded beyond imagination
maximize physical resources- lessen demand on limited campus infrastructure,
decrease congestion on campus and parking lots outreach- give students options,
reach new student markets, appeal to current student’s thus increasing enrollments
disadvantages of online teaching and learning-
before enrolling into an online course, you should also consider some disadvantages of online
education e-learning course could lack accreditation- it is always a good idea
to check if the online course you are interested in has its program accredited
legitimate schools are proud of their status with accrediting agencies, and agencies are happy
to accredit good schools so, this information shouldn’t be hard to find if you earn a degree
from a school with no accreditation, it can be worthless and could leave you in debt
the internet has allowed us to cross boundaries that took a long time to cross, technology has
however, this doesn’t necessarily mean you wouldn’t learn anything, but if getting a degree
is your main objective, please do check verifying an online programs accreditation
is something that can save your time, money and heartache in the long run e-learning
course could provide low quality education- even if online course is accredited, that doesn’t
necessarily mean you will get your money’s worth or time you invest, would be time well spent
use a search engine to find out all of the details about the specific online course
dig the internet, you will find the information that could help you make a final decision,
on whether or not you should enroll face-to-face interaction- there is often
a tendency to underestimate the impact of never meeting the instructor and other students in the
class building relationships with your instructor and classmates will require more effort in an
allowed us to learn and grow with people from around the world it has given access to new
online environment than in a brick and mortar school more work and self discipline- online
courses typically require a greater amount of reading and assignments than traditional classes
programs in general are improving the quality of their online courses
and this means that students will have to do more to prove that they have mastered
the material also online courses usually have deadlines for assignments, quizzes or tests
this requires a lot of self-discipline in order to deal with the schedule
approaches to e-learning- synchronous versus asynchronous, blended learning,
individual versus group, self-paced versus instructor lead synchronous e-learning-
in synchronous e-learning, communication occurs at the same time between individuals
and information is accessed instantly it is characterized by real-time
opportunities in work, learning and socializing we are now witnessing a transformation
﻿hello, welcome to today's session internet utilities-
attachments- some emails could be attached with files, such as text, image, audio,
video, etcetera these files are specified here body- the actual content is stored in this part
this will be in the format of text this field could also include signatures or text generated
automatically by the sender's email system in addition to text messages being sent over email,
it is also possible to attach a file or other data in an email for example, an attachment could be
a picture, pdf, word processor document, movie, program, or any file stored on your computer
however, because of some security issues, it may not be possible to send certain types of
files without additional steps for example, many companies will block
dot exe files from being sent over email and would require you to compress the file into a zip file
also, most email providers have file size restrictions that would prevent any large
which literally means network of networks uses of internet- internet is very useful for
files or programs from being sent over e-mail advantages of email- there are many advantages of
email and the usage of email versus postal mail some of the main advantages are listed below
free delivery- sending an email is virtually free outside the cost of internet service
there is no need to buy a postage stamp to send a letter
global delivery- email can be sent to nearly anywhere around the world to any country
instant delivery- an e-mail can be instantly sent and received by the recipient over the internet
file attachment- an e-mail can include, one or more file attachments allowing a person
to send documents, pictures, or other files within e-mail long term storage- e-mails
are stored electronically, which allows for storage and archival over long period of time
environmental friendly- sending an e-mail does not require paper, paperless, cardboard, or packing
everyone it is the superhighway of information the cost of internet has been reduced over time
tape conserving paper resources email protocols-
we have already discussed the e-mail protocols in the previous session now, we can have a
revisit of the common protocols used for email services such as smtp, pop, i-map, and mime
smtp- simple mail transfer protocol is the standard protocol for email services on a tcp
or ip network smtp provides the ability to send and receive email messages smtp is an application
layer protocol that enables the transmission and delivery of email over the internet
smtp is created and maintained by the internet engineering task force, ietf
simple mail transfer protocol is also known as rfc eight hundred and twenty-one and rfc
two eight two one smtp is generally integrated within an email client application and is
composed of four key components local user or client-end utility known as the mail user agent
the cost of the computer system, modem, and other associated hardware is also likely to come down
‘mua’ server known as mail submission agent ‘msa’ mail transfer agent
smtp usually is implemented to operate over internet port twenty-five an alternative to smtp that
is widely used in europe is x dot four hundred many mail servers now support extended simple
mail transfer protocol ‘esmtp’, which allows multimedia files to be delivered as email
pop- post office protocol pop, is a type of computer networking and internet standard protocol
that extracts and retrieves email from a remote mail server for access by the host
machine post office protocol is the primary protocol behind email communication pop
works through a supporting email software client that integrates pop for connecting to the
in case, computer system is not available, one can browse internet over the mobile phones
remote email server and downloading email messages to the recipient's computer machine
pop uses the tcp ip protocols tag for network connection and
works with simple mail transfer protocol ‘smtp’ for end-to-end email communication,
where pop pulls messages and smtp pushes them to this server there are two versions of pop
the first called pop two became a standard in the mid eighty and requires smtp to send messages
the newer version, pop three can be used with or without smtp
pop three currently supports several authentication methods to provide
varying levels of protection against illegitimate access to a user's e-mail
most are provided by the pop three extension mechanisms pop three client support <?>sasl</?>
authentication methods via, the auth extension pop is a challenge or response protocol,
all major smartphone support browsing functionality
which uses the md five-hash function in an attempt to avoid replay attacks and
disclosure of the shared secret clients implementing a pop include mozilla,
powermail, apple mail, and mutt imap- internet message access protocol
is a standard protocol for accessing e-mail on a remote server from a local client
imap is an application-layer internet protocol using the underlying transport layer protocols
to establish host-to-host communication services for applications this allows the use
of a remote mail server the well-known port address for imap is one four three imap and
pop are still both supported by the majority of modern email servers and clients
however, imap is a remote file server, while pop stores and forwards in other words the imap,
the key to success of internet is the information exchange
all emails remain on the server until the client deletes them imap also permits multiple clients
to access and control the same mailbox when a user requests an e-mail, it is routed
through a central server this keeps a storage document for the e-mail files some of the imap
benefits include the ability to delete messages, search for keywords in the body of emails,
create and manage multiple mailboxes or folders, and view the headings for
easy visual scans of e-mails imap is still used extensively but is less important now that so much
e-mail is sent via web-based interfaces such as gmail, hotmail, yahoo mail, etcetera
mime- multi-purpose internet mail extensions is an extension of the original internet e-mail protocol
that lets people use the protocol to exchange different kinds of data
files on the internet, audio, video images, application programs, and other kinds as well as
the better the quality of information exchange, the more is the usage of internet operations
the ascii text handled in the original protocol, the simple mail transport protocol smtp
the association of internet e-mail with smtp and mind standard is such that the e-mails are
sometimes referred to as smtp or mime e-mail the mime standard defines the content types which are
of prime importance in communication protocols, like http for the world wide web the data are
transmitted in the form of e-mail messages through http even though the data are not an e-mail
the features offered by mime to e-mail services are as follows support for multiple attachments
in a single message support for non-ascii characters support for layouts, fonts and
colors which are categorized as rich text support for attachments which may contain executables,
audio, images and video files, etcetera support for unlimited message length
online banking- online banking allows a user to execute financial transactions via the internet
large volume of information- internet can be used to collect information from around the world
online banking is also known as internet banking or web banking an online bank offers customers
just about every service traditionally available through a local branch including deposits,
which is done online or through the mail and online bill payment online banking offers
several main benefits to depositors it provides a real-time view of finances and eliminates the
need for numerous visits to a bank teller it can also take the place of balancing a
checkbook and other tedious tasks common to paper-based banking depositors can monitor
each transaction in an accessible user interface to understand how credits, deposits, deductions,
and payments affect their account’s balance banks that offer online banking are sometimes called
brick to click many of these banks still provide branch services but support online options
this distinguishes them from brick and mortar banks, which offer no online services brick
this information could relate to education, medicine, literature, software, computers,
and mortar banks are becoming extremely rare in the age of digital transactions,
and most banks have begun moving a number of customer interactions to the web
online banking services- open accounts- you can open checking, saving,
and other accounts online without the need to print or sign anything in the past, you had to
sit with a personal banker during business hours and fend off numerous sales pitches
with electronic signature capability the entire process might take less than ten minutes
pay bills- instead of writing checks to pay bills your bank can print and mail a check for you
month after month it's also possible to transfer money to your pay electronically,
even if the amount you owed changes every month
transfer funds- need to move money from your checking account to your savings account,
business, entertainment, friendship, tourism, and leisure people can search for information
the internet is a worldwide system of computer networks, which was conceived
how about putting extra cash into a certificate of deposit or
opening a brand new cd you do not need to visit a branch or wait on hold to get those things done
you can even link bank accounts at different banks and zap money back and forth
deposit checks- when somebody pays you with a check, there are several ways to deposit it,
the fastest and the easiest option is to use remote check deposit, snap a photo of the check,
and submit it to your bank for payment there is no need to visit a branch or
mail the check-in for more details, learn how to deposit checks with your mobile device
stay informed- in addition to manually checking your account online, you can use old-fashioned
text messages to manage your account, check balances, and more sometimes it feels like
too much work to open an app and log in just to find out how much you have available find out
by visiting the homepage of various search engines such as google, yahoo, bing, etcetera
exactly what types of services are available and have you benefit from texting with your bank
view history- need to see if that check cleared? or how much your employer paid you? it's easy to
view transactions online, download historical statements, and search for specific events
advantages of online banking or internet banking- convenience- banks that offer internet banking are
open for business transactions anywhere a client might be as long as there is internet connection
apart from periods of website maintenance services are available twenty-four hours a day
and three sixty-five days around the year in a scenario, where internet connection is unavailable
customer services are provided around the globe via telephone
low-cost banking service- e-banking helps in reducing the operational costs of banking
services better quality services can be ensured at low cost higher interest rate-
teaching, virtual classes- internet has completely changed the way of teaching in our community
lower operating cost results in higher interest rates on saving and lower interest rates on
mortgages, and loan offers from the bank some banks offer high yield certificate of deposits
and don’t penalize withdrawals on certificate of deposits, opening up accounts without minimum
deposits and no minimum balance transfer services- online banking allows automatic
funding of account from long-established bank accounts via electronic funds transfers
ease of monitoring- a client can monitor his or her pending via a virtual wallet through certain
banks and applications and enable payments ease of transaction- the speed of transaction
is faster relative to the use of atms or customary banking discounts- the credit cards
and debit cards enable the customers to obtain discounts from retail outlets quality service-
e-banking helps the bank to provide efficient, economic, and quality service to the customers
instead of physically going to the classrooms, students can study at comfort of their home
it helps the bank to create new customer and retaining the old ones successfully
anytime cash facility- the customer can obtain funds at any time from atm machines
disadvantages of online banking or internet banking high startup cost- e-banking requires
high initial startup cost it includes internet installation cost, cost of advanced hardware and
software modem, computers, and cost of maintenance of all computers
security concerns- one of the biggest disadvantages of doing e-banking is the
question of security people worry that their bank accounts can be hacked and access without their
knowledge or that the funds they transfer may not reach the intended recipients
training and maintenance- e-banking requires twenty-four hours supportive environment,
support of qualified staff bank has to spend a lot on training to its employees shortage of
they simply need to either subscribe to a teacher for a fee or watch educational lectures
trained and qualified staff is a major obstacle in e-banking activities transaction problems-
face to face meeting is better in handling complex transactions and problems
banks may call for meetings and seek expert advice to solve issues
lack of personal contact between customer and banker- customary banking allows creation of a
personal touch between a bank and its clients a personal touch with a bank manager can enable the
manager to change terms in our account since he or she has some discretion in case of any
personal circumstantial change it can include reversal of an undeserved service charge
online reservation- a computer reservation system or online reservation system is a computerized
system used to store and retrieve information and conduct transactions related to air travel,
hotels, car rental, or other activities booking and reservation system has turned out to be an
that are available free on the internet news and journals- all the newspapers, magazines,
integral part of various industries such as hotel booking, event organization,
table booking, etcetera travel booking, ticket booking for train, flight or car, etcetera
appointment doctor, physiotherapist, personal trainer, etcetera, cinemas, and so forth
an online booking system has many advantages and, honestly speaking a few disadvantages as well
advantages- online booking system facilitates remote bookings and
instant payments which is convenient to both booker and the facility provider
unlike traditionally, bookings can happen round the clock and all the information
can be directly entered into the system, which reduces human errors
it’s easy to up-sell and cross-sell products across categories since they can be displayed
conveniently, the consumer can think about it and can take his own time to go for it or not
and journals of the world are available on the internet with the introduction of broadband and
for example, easy reservation online booking system offers a host of features that help
hoteliers in selling not just accommodation but other amenities and services as well
previously, in case of hotel bookings, guests were not able to get the room view and other details
prior booking or entering the premises while a responsive website and booking engine can display
all the information accurately across devices, which a guest can smoothly browse through
and book their stay online booking systems ensure convenience and comfort to guests,
and a peace of mind no last-minute rush to find a hotel and fear of all rooms being filled up
now, disadvantages- need stable internet access for the guest to book while facilitator
has to do all the technical setups to offer online booking systems may it be railways,
bus bookings, or hotel bookings
advanced mobile telecommunication technologies, such as three g third generation, four g fourth generation,
security- though downtime and security breach instances are rare they are
for real various precautions can be taken by service provider like secure socket connection,
pci dss compliance using reliable cloud service providers like amazon, aws, and so on
transaction drops- in some instances, booker is being charged for the services but the transaction
is dropped at last moment resulting failure in allocation of services like railway tickets,
bus tickets, etcetera though these can be taken care of by auto payment reversal mechanism
it takes time to get the amount credited now, let us move on to summarize this session
we started with an introduction to the important communication method use today the internet
a variety of uses such as huge information transfer, virtual classes, reading books, chitchatting and
social networking, etcetera were discussed then the internet utilities such as e-mail, online
and volte, voice over long term evolution the speed of internet service has increased
banking, and online reservation were discussed in detail with the merits and demerits of each
tremendously a person can get the latest news about the world in a matter of few seconds
read books- we can buy e-books and read online,
in nineteen sixty-nine by the advanced research project agency ‘arpa’ of the us government
there is no need to <?>emark</?> large wardrobes for keeping books
nor do we need to visit library a single mobile device such as tablet can make
available thousands of books at fingertip electronic mode of communication- internet has
given the most exciting mode of communication to all we can send an email the short form
of electronic mailing system to all the corners of the world chatting- there are
many chatting software that can be used to send and receive real-time messages over the internet
we can chat with our friend and relatives using any one of the chatting software
social networking- people can connect with old friends on social networking sites
they can even chat with them when they are online social networking sites also allow us to share
pictures with others we can share pictures with our loved ones while we are on a vacation
it was created with the aim of creating a network that allows researchers at one university, communicate
people are even concluding business deals over these social networking sites such as facebook
online banking or net banking- the use of internet can also be seen in the
field of banking transactions many banks such as hsbc, sbi,
axis bank, hdfc bank, etcetera, offers online banking facilities to its customers
they can transfer funds from one account to another using the internet banking facility
ecommerce- internet is also used for carrying out business operations and that set of operations is
known as electronic commerce, e-commerce flipkart is the largest e-commerce company in india
the rival amazon is giving stiff competition to flipkart
mobile commerce- mobile commerce or m-commerce refers to the commercial transaction that
takes place over the mobile internet using the mobile internet technology, many companies have
with their counterparts at other universities the internet which comprises of thousands
introduced mobile version of websites and mobile apps to promote and sell their products customers
can simply browse several through the products and buy online through mobile internet
mobile wallet- many companies offer the service of mobile wallet to its customers
users must have a smartphone and internet connection to use the service
users can pay an amount into their mobile wallet, which they can use to make online payments such as
bill payments, recharges, etcetera entertainment- apart from a major source
of knowledge and information, the utility of internet in the field of entertainment cannot be
undermined we can visit various video sites and watch movies and serials at our convenient time
technology of the future- internet is the technology of future
in the times to come, offices would be managed at distant places through internet
of smaller regional networks, scattered throughout the globe allows communication to take place
utilities on the internet- internet is a global system that can be used for sharing information,
providing worldwide services and communication daily updates are easily and instantly available
in the internet also, you can search for any information that you are looking for
in the internet a lot of products and services are sold and provided through internet today
once upon a time, telephone was considered a fast mode of communication
now, internet has enormously emerged and replaced telephone as swift mode of communication
some of the important internet utilities such as email, online banking, and online
reservation are described here email- email stands for electronic mail
it is the message distributed by electronic means among computer users in a network
an email will be sent from one user and can be distributed to many the email was initially
between connected computers and online users today, the internet is a public cooperated and
first used in the nineteen sixties it took its current form in the nineteen seventies
in fact, some earlier systems required both the sender and receiver to be online which,
similar to have instant messaging works today let us see the parts of e-mail and their
subdivisions in detail the popular email services which are available at free of cost include
structure of an e-mail there is a standard structure for emails
email contents are primarily classified as two,
the header and the body we are going to see the contents come under the two subparts
the header- the email header gives us common details about the message such as the unique identity of
the message the details of the users of the from and to ends are also stored here
self-sustaining facility accessible to billions of people worldwide what distinguishes it from
the email header consists of the following parts however, the exact contents of the header
can vary according to the email systems that generate the email message subject, sender from,
date and time received on, reply to, recipient to, recipient email address, attachments
subject- the subject part is the topic of the message in most email systems
if the content view of the folders is set to view each messages separately the subject part
also will be visible with the user's name the subject fields are scanned by the spam scanners
to evaluate the messages sender from, this field describes the from address of the email
this will specify the sender's email address usually, it will be the reply-to address
date, and time received on- this is the date and time, the message received reply-to- this field
describes the email address that will become the recipient of the reply to the particular email
other telecommunication networks is its use of a set of protocol called tcp and icp,
when you reply, it will go to this email address despite the sender email address
recipient to- this is the first last name of the email recipient as configured by the sender
the cc, that is carbon copy field allows you to specify recipients who are not direct addressees
listed in the, two field for instance, you can address an email to jeff and cc to linda and
steven although the email is address to jeff, linda and steven will also receive a copy of
the message and their addresses will be visible to jeff and to each other the field is optional
the blind carbon copy bcc field is similar to cc, except that the recipients are secret
each bcc recipient will receive the email but will not see who else received a copy
the addresses anyone listed in the two field remain visible to all recipients this field is optional
recipient email address- the email address of the recipient is specified here
transmission control protocol, and internet control protocol the internet,
computer, hard drives, and storage devices are an excellent way to store data
this was about the role of computers in education
but we know it's not just the education sector, which computers have impacted
they are of great use in every field
today, a life without computers is unimaginable
this underlines the importance of computer education
knowledge of computers can propel once carrier in the right direction
computers are a part of almost every industry today
they are no longer limited and specific field
they are used in networking for information access in data storage, and also in the processing
technology helps us to save time and effort by providing convenience at work
and presentation of information
electronic learning- e-learning, or learning through computer and information technology
is fast become to solution of providing learning with the tools necessary to address the needs
of students, in order to provide good and standardized education
students can interact with the e-learning software, enjoy the colorful presentations,
play games, and answer the objective questions with personal involvement
in recent years, schools and universities started to utilize the web and locker networks
as a platform for distance learning
tools like webct, enspire, webex, and virtual classrooms of hp, ibm, etcetera, allow students
to understand, learn, and interact effectively, as the class experiences available online
due to the multifaceted advantages, information technology is becoming popular
students can log in from home or school, enjoy interactive presentations, watch a webcast,
or even participate in live discussions and quizzes
e-learning includes computer-based training cbt and web-based training wbt
cbt is the training where a computer program provides motivation and feedback in place
of a live instructor
it can be delivered through cd-rom, lan, or the internet
wbt is the training which delivers educational content through a web browser over the public
internet or private intranet
this type of training often provides links to other learning resources such as references,
emails, and discussion groups
basic components of information technology- the components of it include hardware, software,
it may also include a facilitator who can provide course guidelines, manage discussion
boards, deliver lectures, and so on
virtual class rooms- this technology helps attract the students interest
this concept involves a student with software that reacts and interacts, unlike a book
so, it is possible to get immediate feedback on students actions like answer for quizzes
or requests for more information
with the help of virtual learning, students can search databases, listen to pre-recorded
videos, discuss the related matters with teachers or other students through e-mails or discussion
groups, use appropriate resources to get and apply knowledge
hence, the students can get online education from remote places
data, and people
virtual classrooms are intended for the students who are unable to attend centralized classrooms
due to distant locations of institutions
role of computers in research- computers have a very important role to play in research
activities
it has become an essential tool for research, whether it be for academic purpose or for
commercial purpose
you can find all kinds of information on the internet, and you can even discuss such problems
with people around the world
computers had led the way to a globalized information portal that is the world wide
web
these are the essentials for the proper working of the systems in it
by using world wide web, we can conduct primary as well as secondary research on a massive
scale
various computer programs and applications have eased our way into compiling our research process
role of computer in conceptual phase- the conceptual phase consists of formulation of
research problem, extensive literature survey, theoretical framework, and developing the hypothesis
computers help for searching the literature's for review of literature and bibliographic
reference stored in the electronic database of the world wide webs
it can thus be used for storing relevant published articles to the retrieved whenever needed
this has the advantage over searching the literatures in the form of books, journals,
and other newsletters at the libraries, which consume considerable amount of time and effort
hardware consists of physical components that form a computer system, or any other electronic devices
role of computers in design and planning phase- this phase consists of research design preparation,
and determining sample design
design and planning phase also consist of population, research variables, sampling plan,
review research plan, and pilot study
several softwares are available to calculate the sample size required for a proposed study
the standard deviation of the data from the pilot study is required for the sample size calculation
role of computers in data collection phase- this empirical phase consists of collecting
and preparing the data for analysis
in research studies, the preparation and inputting data is the most labour intensive and time-consuming
aspect of the work
both hardware and software are necessary to run a computer system
typically, the data will be initially recorded on a questionnaire or record suitable for
its acceptance by the computer
to do this, the researcher in conjunction with the statistician and the programmer will
convert the data into microsoft word file or excel spreadsheet, or any statistical software
data file
this data can be directly open with the statistical software for analysis
the data obtained from the subjects are stored in computers are word files or excel spreadsheets,
or any statistical software data file
this has the advantage of making necessary corrections or editing the whole layout of
the tables if needed, which is impossible or time-consuming in case of writing in papers
examples include keyboard, monitor, mobile phones, etcetera
thus, computers help in data entry, data editing, data management, including follow up actions
computers also allow for greater flexibility in recording the data while they are collected
as well as greater ease during the analysis of this data
examples of editors are wordpad, spss data editor, word processor, and ultra edit, etcetera
most researchers are anxious about seeing the data, what they look like, how they are
distributed, etcetera
so, you can also examine different dimension of variables or plot them in various charts
using a statistical application
role of computers in data analysis- this phase consists of the analysis of data, hypothesis
testing and generalizations and interpretation
software is a set of instructions in the form of programs, which control the sequence of
data analysis phase mainly consists of statistical analysis of the data and interpretation of results
many softwares are now available to perform the mathematical part of the research process,
that is the calculations using various statistical methods
softwares like spss and spreadsheets are the widely used, they can be like calculating
the sample size for a proposed study, hypothesis testing, and calculating the power of the
study
familiarity with anyone package will sufficient to carry out the most intricate statistical analysis
computers are useful not only for statistical analysis
but, also to monitor the accuracy and completeness of the data as they are collected
these softwares also display the results in graphical chart or graph form
tasks to be carried out
consider any profession, computers have changed the way they work
role of computer in research publication- this phase consists of preparation of the
report or presentation of the results, that is formal write up of conclusions reached
this is the research publication phase, the research article, research paper, research
thesis, or research dissertation is typed in word processing software and converted
to portable data format that is pdf and stored and republished in the world wide web
online sites are available through we can convert our word file into any format like
html, pdf, etcetera
various online applications are also available for these purposes
even we prepare our document using online word processing software and can store edit
or access it from any way using internet
software runs along with hardware
career opportunities in the it industry- the fast spread of it has generated a need for
highly trained workers to design and develop new information systems and to integrate new
technologies in them
it professionals plan, design, develop, support, and manage strategies and adapt them to fulfill
basic objectives of the firm
the rapidly changing technologies require the employees to have more skills and education
apart from the traditional jobs like programmer, system analyst, network administrator, etcetera
some of the career opportunities available in the industry are it consultant
the job of an it consultant is to evaluate the systems and do the research that no one
else entirely understands
for example, the software present in computer system helps to interact with the systems
it is one of the most recent best job in the field
cloud architect- although the storage space existing in the <?>ether<?>* can't be touched
literally, it still needs to be organized and given an architecture
that is what this job is for
computer forensic investigator- as the use of computer and it are growing rapidly
the crimes related to the electronic media called cybercrimes are also getting increased
computer forensic investigators search for identify and evaluate information from computer
systems often for trial evidence
they usually work for the government and related agencies
health it specialists- health it is a blossoming field, especially with major changes going
and helps to run specific applications like calculator playing videos, etcetera
on in health care due to the affordable care act, and the gradual transition to electronic
health records
health it specialist will mix computer knowledge with record-keeping skills
but, specialties in medical coding, billing, and cancer registry are also in demand
mobile app developer- now, most people you know have smartphones and or tablet computers
the use of mobile tech is exceeded personal computers at some time in two thousand thirteen
so, business are more heavily relying on it professional with experience in this field
than ever before
using basic coding languages, developers will create programs for future ios and android
devices
data are unprocessed representation of information in various fields that can be communicated
geospatial professionals- geographic information systems are complicated, but exciting every day
gis tech uses geographic data to evaluate and communicate trends and patterns in visually
stylish and comprehensive ways
information technology and internet- the greatest strength of internet is, its ability to support
simultaneous interactive communication among different people
internet allows information to flow back and forth among multiple users at the same time
the information residing on different computers around the world can be easily linked together
using hyperlinks, which is a method of organizing information on the system by linking one document
to another
the services provided by internet include e-mail, newsgroup, file transfer, multimedia
with the system easily
displays, live-broadcasting, shopping opportunities, and much more
e-mails allow the user to send and receive electronic mails for transferring text messages
across a network
this is considered to be the fastest and reliable technology for sending information
and newsgroup is a forum formed for the discussion on a particular subject in which the notes
on a website are accessed and redistributed through a worldwide network of new discussion groups
they are hierarchically organized indicating major subjects, categories, and subcategories
users can create new newsgroups, post to existing newsgroups, and respond to previous posts
webcasting refers to the use of the web to deliver or broadcast by streaming live or
delayed versions of sound or video
data can be meaningful or meaningless
webcasting has potential applications in academic courses, presentations, on-demand programs,
live events, and training materials
in this session, the importance of information technology is described in detail
the role of it in education, like creating better teaching and learning environments,
and in research for better outcomes are described
we have also seen, some of the most demanded it jobs
hope you enjoyed this session
see you next time
until then, bye
data can be collected for communication, processing, or analyzing
people play an important role in it
the various processing functions are performed with the help of both hardware and software
computers and it are important in different areas such as education, research, business,
therefore, it’s only natural that the role of computers in education and research has
industry, healthcare, publishing, defense, and many more
here we will see in detail the role of computers in education and research
computer technology has had a deep impact on the education sector
computers played an important role in imparting education to become easier and much more interesting
than before
owing to the memory capacities of computers, large chunks of data can be stored in them
they enable quick processing of data with very less or no chances of errors in processing
network the computers aid, quick communication, and enable web access
storing documents on computers in the form of soft copies instead of hard ones helps
to save paper
been given much importance in recent years
the use of computer in education is started in nineteen seventies
the advantages of computers in education primarily include storage of information, quick data
processing, audio-visual aids in teaching, better presentation of information, access
to the internet, quick communication between students, teachers, and parents
computer teaching plays a key role in the modern education system
students find it easier to refer to the internet than searching for information in fat books
the process of learning has gone beyond learning from prescribed textbooks
internet is a much larger and easier to access storehouse of information
when it comes to storing retrieved information
it is easily done on computers than maintaining handwritten notes
this is also why the education system has included it as a part of school curriculum
computers are a brilliant aid in teaching- online education has revolutionized the education industry
computer technology has made the dream of distance learning a reality
education is no longer limited to classrooms
it has reached far and wide, thanks to computers
physically distant locations have come closer due to internet accessibility
so, even if students and teachers are not in the same premises, they can very well communicate
with one another
there are many online educational courses whereby students are not required to attend
classes or be physically present for lectures
they can learn from the comfort of their homes and adjust timings as per their conveniences
considering the use of computer technology in almost every sphere of life, it is important
computers have given impetus to distance education- computers facilitate effective presentation
of information
presentation software, like powerpoint and animation software like flash, among others,
can be of great help to teachers while delivering lectures
computers facilitate audio-visual representation of information, thus making the process of
learning interactive and interesting
computer-aided teaching adds a fun element to education
teachers hardly use chalk and board today
they bring presentations on a flash drive, plug it into a computer in the classroom,
and then teaching begins
for everyone to have at least the basic knowledge of using computers and technology
there is colour, there is sound there is movement the same all information comes forth in a
different way and learning becomes fun
the otherwise not so interesting lessons become interesting due to audio-visual effects
due to the visual aid, difficult subjects can be explained in better ways
computer software help better presentation of information- internet can play an important
role in education
as it is an enormous information base
it can be harmnessed for retrieval of information on a variety of subjects
the internet can be used to refer to information on different subjects, both teachers and students
benefit from the internet
the information age began with the invention of the telegraph transmitter, and receiver
teachers can refer to it for additional information and references on the topics to be taught
students can refer to web sources for additional information on subjects of their interest
the internet helps teachers set test papers, frame questions for home assignments, and
decide project topics
and not just academics teachers can use web sources for ideas on sports competitions,
extracurricular activities, picnics, parties, and more
computers enable access to the internet which has information on literally everything
computers enable storage of data in the electronic format, thereby saving paper
memory capacities of computer storage devices are in gigabytes
this enables them to store huge chunks of data
the information is the process data on which decisions are taken and consequent actions
moreover, these devices are compact, they occupy very less space, it store large amounts
of data
both teachers and students benefit from the use of computer technology
presentations, notes, and test papers can be stored and transferred easily over computer
storage devices
similarly, students can submit homework and assignments as soft copies, the process becomes
paperless, thus saving paper
plus, the electronic format makes data storage more durable
electronically erasable memory devices can be used repeatedly
they offer robust storage of data and reliable data retrieval
are performed
﻿hi friends, now we will have an introduction to artificial intelligence
proposal was to allow a human-called interrogator to communicate with a test subject by means of
a typewriter system without being told whether the test subject was a human or a machine
here the machine should behave intelligently, so that the interrogator can distinguish it from
a human to conduct this test, there will be two people and one machine
the person who plays the role of interrogator will be in a separate room from the computer and the
other person the interrogator can ask questions by typing and also receive typed responses
the interrogator tries to determine which is person and which is the machine the goal of
the machine is to make the interrogator believe that it is the person if it succeeds at this,
then we can conclude that the machine can think a well-known example of the turing test,
the result of the program, doctor elissa developed by joseph weizenbaum,
better this definition provides a good outline of what constitute ai and avoids the philosophical
it is an interactive program conducting a psychological interview
some of you might have experienced it the computer plays the role of the analyst
while the user plays as the patient the purpose of developing doctor was
to study the natural language communication internally, doctor restructures the statements
made by the patient according to some predefined rules and directs them back to the patient
for example, his response to the statement 'i am tired today', the doctor replies as 'why
do you think you are tired today?' instead of <?> ‘gone' or 'that is very interesting'</?>
doctor projected the image of comprehension so strongly that many who communicated with it became
complained to the machine’s question and answer dialogue
hence, the doctor passes the turing test the other examples which passed turing test
issues that dominate attempts to define the meaning of either artificial or intelligence
include internet viruses that carry on intelligent dialogues with a human victim
to trick him into dropping his malware guard and computer games such as chess playing programs
the robot dogs that project adorable personalities by tilting their heads
or lifting ears in response to a sound are examples of intelligent robotics
perception- understanding the input from the sensors to exhibit intelligent response
is called perception or perceiving ability perception involves interpreting sights, sounds,
smells and touch action includes the ability to navigate through the world and manipulate objects
if we want to build robots that live in the world, we must understand these processes most of ai
is concerned with only cognition, we will simply add sensors and actuators to them
but, the problems in perception and actions are substantial in their own right, and are
some philosophical issues- now, the problem areas of ai are the domains that require
being tackled by researchers in the field of robotics two main challenging aspects of
research in perception are image processing and language processing
image processing- an image is recognized using an optical character reader, but it has a limitation
that a certain degree of uniformity for the style, size and orientation of the symbols are required
the bit pattern produced by a physically large character does not match the template for a
smaller version of the same symbol, even though the shapes are the same
so, it has increased difficulty while trying to process handwritten material
another approach of character recognition is based on
matching the geometric characteristics rather than the exact appearance of the symbols
this involves two steps first, extract the features from the image being processed
only specialized expertise without the assistance of common-sense knowledge
second, compare the features to those of not symbols but minor errors in the image can
produce a set of entirely different geometric features as between a three and an eight
the task of understanding general images is usually a two-step process of image processing
and image analysis image processing refers to identifying characteristics of the image and image
analysis refers to the process of understanding the meaning of these characteristics
image processing involves various subjects one is edge enhancement, which is the process of
applying mathematical techniques to clarify the boundaries between regions in an image it is
an attempt to convert a photograph into a line drawing another activity is smoothing, which
is the process of removing imperfections in the image smoothing keeps errors in the image from
confusing the other image processing steps image analysis is the process of determining
there are expert systems in everyday operation throughout all areas of industry and government
what the identifying components represent and what the image means
region finding is an activity in image analysis in which those areas
in an image that have common properties such as brightness, colour, or texture are identified
there are numerous problems associated with general image analysis
language processing- another perception problem is that of understanding languages it is the process
of a computer extracting meaningful information from natural language in theory, natural language
processing or nlp is a very attractive method of human computer interaction
natural language understanding is sometimes referred to as an ai complete problem, because
it seems to require extensive knowledge about the outside world and the ability to manipulate it
whether nlp is distinct from or identical to the field of computational linguistics
these systems try to solve partially or completely significant practical problems,
is a matter of perspective the association for computational linguistics defines
the latter as focusing on the theoretical aspects of nlp
the success in translating formal high-level programming languages into machine language led
researchers to believe that the ability to program computers to understand natural language was easy
but programming languages are constructed from well-designed primitives so that each
statement has only one grammatical structure and only one meaning
but a statement in natural language can have multiple meanings depending on its context
to reveal the meaning of a statement in natural language, several levels of analysis is required
the first one is syntactic analysis in which parsing is done, it has the role of
identifying the grammar of the statement another level of analysis is called semantic
which previously required limited human expertise but the early works were focused on formal tasks
analysis it tries to identify the action, the agent of that action,
and the object of that action the other levels of analysis is, context analysis
at this level, the context of the sentence is brought into the understanding process
another area of research in natural language processing concerns
an entire document rather than individual sentences the two categories of problems
to be considered here are information retrieval and information extraction
information retrieval refers to the task of identifying documents that relate to the topic
at hand an example is finding the sites related to a particular topic from the world wide web
the current state is to search for keywords, but this often produces false leads
a search mechanism that understands the contents of the site is to be considered this leads
like game playing, and theorem proving another area ai focused on the sort of problem
to the techniques called semantic web information extraction refers to the task of
extracting information from documents so that it takes a form that is useful in other applications
the system makes use of several templates semantic net is a large linked data structure
in which pointers are used to indicate association among the data items
and it's time to summarize the session this module gives an introduction to the world of
artificial intelligence, which makes the computer systems to behave with sense
it takes intelligent decisions with the help of knowledge it acquired through learning this
module refers to the various techniques used for solving artificial intelligent problems,
and describes about the intelligent agents the turing test is mentioned here and two of
the challenging problems such as the image processing and language processing are explained
solving called common sense reasoning it includes reasoning about physical objects,
before moving to the next session, please try to answer the following questions
what are the different types of intelligent actions that might be made by an agent? explain
turing test? list the various techniques used in ai? explain any of the challenging problems in ai?
hope you enjoyed the session see you next time until then, goodbye take care
and their relationships to each other, and reasoning about actions and their consequences
artificial intelligence or ai is the branch of computer science that tries to build machines,
as a result of research in ai, perception, natural language processing, problem solving
in specialized domains, such as medical diagnosis and chemical analysis were attempted
perception involves interpreting <?>sights</?>, sounds, smells and touch action includes the
ability to navigate through the world and manipulate objects but perception of the
surrounding world is crucial animals with much less intelligence than people have more
sophisticated visual perception than machines these types of tasks involve analog signals,
which are very noisy and large number of things must be perceived at once
the ability to use language to communicate ideas is perhaps the most significant thing
that separate humans from other animals the largest part of human linguistic communication
occurs as speech written language processing is easier if it is written in unambiguous characters
which can carry out complex tasks without human intervention for this, the machines
than processing speech we use language in a variety of ways in different situations,
that no single definition of understanding is able to account for them all
in order to understand sentences about a topic, it is required to know a lot about the language
as well as a good deal about the topic to recognize the unstated assumptions
the specialized tasks, which can be served by the artificial intelligent techniques
include engineering design, scientific discovery, medical diagnosis and financial planning
ai techniques- ai technique is a method of exploiting knowledge
that should be represented in such a way that
the knowledge captures generalizations, it is not necessary to represent separately
each individual situation it should be understood by people who must provide it it should be
will be able to perceive and <?>0 - 36</?> the desire to build machines that mimic human
modified to correct errors and to reflect changes in the world and in our view of the world
it should be used in many situations, even if it is not completely accurate
it should be used to help overcome its own bulk by helping to narrow the range of possibilities
that must usually be considered the ai technique must be designed so as to preserve
the constraints imposed by the ai problems, but there will be some degree of independence between
problems and problem-solving techniques however, the ai problems can be solved
without using ai techniques and ai techniques can be used to solve non-ai
problems the three important ai techniques are search, use of knowledge and abstraction
search- it is a way of solving problems for which no more direct approach is available
if any direct techniques are available, they can be embedded into a framework use of knowledge-
behaviour has a long history but the modern field of artificial intelligence had its origins
it is a method of solving complex problems by exploiting the structure of the objects
that are involved abstraction- this technique provides a way of separating important features
from the many unimportant ones that would otherwise overwhelm any process
it is not possible to give a very precise definition of an ai technique
ai programs are easier to build using languages that have been designed to support symbolic rather
than numeric computation lisp has been the most commonly used language for ai programming another
language used for ai programming is prolog when ai comes into the conventional programming world,
ai systems are being written in general purpose programming languages like c
intelligent agents-
the realm of artificial intelligence is large and merges with other subjects such as psychology,
in nineteen fifty, when alan turing, who is considered as the father of ai published the
neurology, mathematics, linguistics, and electrical and mechanical engineering
an agent is a device that respond to stimuli from its environment most of the agents receive
data from the environment through sensors and affect the environment through actuators
microphone, cameras, air sampling devices, etcetra are examples for sensors
some of the commonly used actuators are wheels, legs, wings and speech synthesizers
the artificial intelligence aim to build agents that behave intelligently the actions of the
agent's actuators must be rational responses to the data received through its senses
to obtain more intelligent behaviour, higher levels of responses are needed
in order to adjust the actions according to environment,
the agent should possess higher levels of knowledge hence, the storage, updation,
article, 'computing machinery and intelligence', in which he proposed that machines could be
access and application of real-world knowledge become a challenging problem
in artificial intelligence if the agent's responses improve over time, as the agent learns,
it can be considered as procedural knowledge or declarative knowledge procedural knowledge is to
learn how and declarative knowledge is learning what procedural knowledge involves a trial and
error process by which an agent learns appropriate actions the approach used here is to punish
for poor actions and reward for good ones acquiring declarative knowledge takes the form of
expanding or altering the facts in an agent's store of knowledge an agent must be able to
extract information from the data produced by its sensors to initiate responses to stimuli
this is called ability to perceive but perceiving speech and image is a tiresome process,
and in some situations, the agent must generate speech to be compatible with their actuators
programmed to exhibit intelligent behaviour even though this field is in its infancy, some
now, we may see an agent that will provide a solution to the eight puzzle eight square tiles
labelled one through eight would be mounted in a frame, which is capable of holding a total of nine
such tiles in three rows and three columns among the tiles in the frame is a vacancy into which
any of the adjacent tiles can be pushed, allowing the tiles in the frames to be scrambled the
problem here is to move the tiles in a scrambled puzzle back to their initial positions
the agent to solve this puzzle has the form of a box equipped with gripper,
a video camera and a finger with a rubber end so that it does not slip when pushing something
when the agent is turned on for the first time, it's gripper starts to open and close as asking
for the puzzle when this scrambled eight puzzle is placed on the gripper, it closes then the
machine's finger lowers and begins pushing the tiles around in the frame until they are back
astonishing results has been produced, especially in the field of gaming theory in fact, artificial
in their original positions then the machine releases the puzzle and turns off itself
the behaviour of an agent is judged by observing the input response patterns these
two approaches are performance oriented and simulation oriented maximizing the
performance of an agent is performance oriented and trying to find out how the
responses are produced is simulation oriented the researchers in linguistics are interested in
learning how humans process language and operate in simulation-oriented mode but the researchers
in the field of natural language processing are interested in developing systems that
can manipulate natural languages like document translations and machines responding to verbal
commands operate in performance-oriented mode the turing test-the turing test proposed by alan
turing has been served as a benchmark in measuring the progress in artificial intelligence this
intelligence or ai is the study of how to make computers do things which at present people do
﻿hello, welcome to today's session ‘data analysis’
to create charts and other infographics designed to make their findings easier to understand
tools used for data analysis- the growing demand and importance of data analysis in the
market have generated many openings worldwide it becomes slightly tough to shortlist the top data
analysis tools, as the open source tools are more popular, user friendly and performance oriented
than the paid version there are many open source tools which doesn't require much or any coding
and manages to deliver better results than paid versions some of them are-

network metrics, access to social media network data importers and automation
gephi- gephi is also an open source network analysis and visualization software package
written in java on the netbeans platform think of the giant friendship maps you see that represent
linkedin or facebook connections gephi takes that step further by providing exact calculations
applications of data analysis-
now, below are the various areas where data analysis applications have been employed
policing or security- several cities all over the world have employed predictive analysis
in predicting areas that would likely witness surge in crime with the use of geographical data
types of data analytics- data analytics is broken down into four basic types- descriptive analytics,
and historical data although it is not possible to make arrests for every crime
committed but the availability of data has made it possible to have police officers within such
areas at a certain time of the day, which has led to drop, in crime rate
fraud and risk detection- this has been known as one of the initial
applications of data science*, which was extracted from the discipline of finance
so, many organizations had very bad experiences with debt, and were so fed up with it since they
already had data that was collected during the time their customers applied for loans,
they applied data signs*, which eventually rescued them from the losses they had incurred
this led to banks learning to divide and conquer data from their customer’s profiles, reason
expenditure and other significant information that were made available to them this made
diagnostic analytics, predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics descriptive analytics-
it easy for them to analyse and infer if there was any probability of customers defaulting
manage risk- in the insurance industry, risk management is the major focus
what most people aren't aware of is that when enduring a person, the risk involved is not
obtained based on mere information, but data that has been analysed statistically before a decision
is made data analysis gives insurance companies information on claims data, actuarial data,
and risk data covering all important decision that the company needs to take evaluation is done by
an underwriter before an individual insured, then the appropriate insurance is set
these days, analytical software is used for detecting the various forms of fraudulent claims
risky claims are detected by red flag indicators which can be examined it is
very essential to bring such claims to the attention of administrators
descriptive analytics describes what has happened over a given period of time
due to the manner at which automation is improving claims processing efficiency
delivery logistics- well, data signs and analysis have no limited applications
there are several logistic companies working all over the world, such as ups,
dhl, fedex, etcetera, that make use of data for improving their efficiency in operations
from data analysis applications, these companies have found the most suitable routes for shipping
the best delivery time, most suitable means of transport to select so as to gain cost efficiency,
and many others also, data generated by these companies through the use of gps gives them enough
opportunities to take advantage of data analysis and data science
web provision- there is this general belief that smart cities have fast internet speed
provided either by their government or companies present there, therefore declaring them smart
as the name implies, descriptive analysis or statistics can summarize
well, just because people can access facebook or youtube at the speed of lightning doesn't
necessarily make a city smart although there may be the presence of fast internet,
but this is just one thing it needs to be present in the appropriate place
and accessed by the right people as well the key component of this is being able to
shift bandwidth at the right time and location this can only be achieved by the use of data
the main assumption is that commercial and financial areas should have the highest
bandwidth during weekdays, while residential areas should get such on weekends
the real truth is that the situation is more complex than it looks and this can only be solved
by data analysis application for example, if a particular community wants to get the attention
of web development companies and high-tech industries and make them establish there,
raw data and convert it into a form that can be easily understood by humans
data analysis is the process of examining data sets in order to draw conclusions about
a higher bandwidth would be required only data analysis could get this done effectively
proper spending- another issue with smart cities is the large amount of money spent on little work
small changes or landmark remodelling which one would dismiss as unnecessary projects consumes
so much money data analysis applications would target where taxpayer’s money would
have a major impact on and the kind of work that they would be adequate for it
the targeting of where this money should be spend would lead to the entire city's
infrastructure getting a facelift with a reduction of excess money spent
customer interactions- this is another one of the applications of data analysis in insurance
insurance can determine a lot about their services by conducting regular customer surveys, mainly
after interacting with claim handlers they could use this to know which of their services are good
they can describe in detail about an event that has occurred in the past this type of
and the ones that would need more improvement various demographics may desire diverse methods of
communication like in-person interactions, websites, phone, or just email taking
the analysis of customer demographics with feedback can help <?>insurers</?>
improve on customer experience depending on customer behaviour, and proven insights
a study recently carried out showed that a lack of investment in technology was the cause
customer dissatisfaction of the present generation of insurance customers because they prefer using
mobile and online channels, social media and other recent mediums to interact with their agents
however, the older generation still prefers the use of the telephone to improve the
overall experience of customers it is best for insurance companies to provide a wide range of
communication methods for their customers city planning- one big mistake being made
analytics is helpful in deriving any pattern if any from past events or drawing
in many places is that analysis is not considered when pursuing city planning as a matter of fact,
web traffic and marketing are still being used instead of the creation of spaces and buildings
this really causes a lot of issues to power over data due to influence on things like
building, zoning and amenity creation models that are built will maximize the
accessibility of specific areas or services, while the risk of overloading significant elements of
the infrastructure in the city is minimized this implies that it creates efficiency we usually see
buildings that are built on sports that looks suitable but actually have a negative effect on
other places this is because such issues were not considered during the period of planning
data analysis applications, as well as modelling would make it easy to mark the outcome of
erecting a structure on any spot
interpretations from them so that better strategies for the future can be framed
health care- one challenge most hospitals face is coping with cost pressure in treating
as many patients as possible considering the quality of health care's improvement
machine and instrument data use has risen drastically so as to optimize and track treatment,
patient flow as well as the use of equipment in hospitals there is an estimation that a
one percent efficiency gain will be achieved and would result to over dollar sixty-three billion
in worldwide healthcare services travel- data analysis applications help in the
optimization of travellers buying experience via social media and mobile or weblog data analysis
this is because customer’s preferences and desires can be obtained from this,
therefore, making companies sell products from the correlation of the current sales
to recent browse, to buy conversation through customized offers and packages
examples, have the number of views gone up? are sales stronger this month and last?
data analysis applications can also deliver personalized travel recommendations depending
make apply data analysis to energy management and cover areas like energy optimization,
smart grid management, distribution of energy and building automation for utility companies
data analysis application here focuses mainly on monitoring and controlling of dispatch crew,
network devices and make sure service outages are properly managed utilities get the ability
to integrate as much as millions of data points within the performance of the network,
which allows the engineers make use of the analysis in monitoring the network
internet or web search- when one mentions the word search,
the first thing that comes to the mind is google in fact, google to some point can be
diagnostic analytics- the obvious successor to descriptive analytics is diagnostic
used in place of search on the internet by saying google it well, apart from google,
each of these search engines is a result of data science applications because they use algorithms
to deliver the best results for any search query directed them in just a split second
in respect to this, google is known to process over twenty petabytes of data daily
of course, without analysis and data science, this feat wouldn't have been possible
digital advertisement- apart from web search, there is another area where data analysis
and data science serves a very important purpose, digital advertisements from the
banners displayed on several websites to the digital billboards seen in the big cities,
all are controlled by data algorithms this shows why digital adverts get more ctr than
analytics diagnostic analytical tools aid an analyst to dig deeper into an issue at hand,
the conventional way of advertisements targets depend solely on the past behaviour of users
the importance of data analysis applications cannot be overemphasized because it is used in
almost all areas of life, today we can see that having data is very important
before making certain decisions so as to avoid necessary issues
also, handling valuable data efficiency could lead to several problems like different departments
in an organization not understanding how to make use of it, which would lead to data not
used to its full potential or serving any purpose however, data has become more available and
accessible to more people, therefore no longer at the disposal of data scientists and analysts
almost everybody within an organization can make use of data for the increase of productivity
and make very important decisions of course,
so that they can arrive at a source of a problem diagnostic analysis takes focuses
proper use of data would have a positive impact on business and even the society in general
analysis of education- the rapid advancement of big data analysis makes it necessary for any
organization to coincide it with their management and measurement processes
while considering the education sector, it is now becoming essential to analyse data
for the development of both learning and academic activities so, the analysis in education sector
can be divided into two broader categories- learning analysis, and academic analysis
learning analysis is the measurement and analysis of collections of
data about learners and their contexts for making learning more and more effective
academic analysis is concerned with the improvement of resources,
processes and workflows of the academic institution, through the use of learner,
more on why something happened this involves more diverse data inputs and a bit of hypothesizing
academic and institutional data the following are the applications of data analysis in education
to help individual learners-
la can help individual learners to identify their weakness and achievements
and to relate their behavioural patterns with others learner's motivation success,
and confidence can be enhanced by providing them timely information about their performance
suggestions on individuals’ activities can also be provided to identify significant knowledge gaps
rapid achievements of learners are possible through providing them access to the tools to
evaluate their progress and to identify the activities that produces best results
to help mentors- analysis can make it easy for teachers to identify the students who require
extra support and attention mentors can utilize their time and effort from
examples, did the weather affect beer sales? did that latest marketing campaign impact sales?
the analytical information on student’s weakness and ability and can find proper
interventions for individual students they can also identify the proper teaching practices
that have the best impact on the students to help developing curriculum and learning
processes- through analysis, it is convenient to find out the flaws of current courses and contents
and to improve the curriculum offerings through the utilization of analyse data generated during
real time learning activities, better curriculum development and advanced quality learning can be
achieved individual learner can receive resources and training according to their knowledge, state,
through the personalization and adaptation of developed learning process and contents
to help administrators- administrators can take decisions on different efficiency and
effectiveness measures based on the analytical information of real time data so, it becomes
predictive analytics- predictive analytics moves to what is likely going to happen in the near
the information they contain, increasing with the aid of specialized systems and software
easy for them to identify retention, progress and completion factors of the organization it
is also possible to reduce attrition through the early detection of at-risk students and generating
alerts for learners and educators thank you for watching today's program thank you
term any business that is pursuing success should have foresight predictive analytics
helps businesses to forecast trends based on the current events whether its predicting the
probability of an event happening in future, or estimating the accurate time it will happen
can all be determined with the help of predictive analytical models examples, what happened to
sales last time we had a hot summer, how many weather models predict a hot summer this year?
prescriptive analytics- this type of analytics explains the step by step
process in a situation for instance, a prescriptive analysis is what comes into
play when your uber driver gets the easier route from g maps the best route was chosen
by considering the distance of every available route from your pickup route to the destination
and the traffic constraints on each road prescriptive analytics moves into the
data analysis technologies and techniques are widely used in commercial industries
territory of suggesting a cause of action examples, if the likelihood of a hot summer
as measured as an average of these five weather models is about fifty eight percent,
then we should add an evening shift to the brewery and rent an additional tank to increase output
complexity of different types of data analytics
advantages and disadvantages of data analytics- following are the advantages of data analytics
it detects and corrects the errors from data sets with the help of data cleansing
this helps in improving quality of data and consecutively benefits both
customers and institutions such as banks, insurance and finance companies
it removes duplicate information from data sets and hence saves large amount of memory space
this decreases cost to the company it helps in displaying relevant advertisements on the
to enable organizations to make more informed business decisions, and by
online shopping websites based on historic data and purchase behaviour of the users
machine learning algorithms are applied for the same this helps in increasing revenue
and productivity of the companies it reduces banking risks by identifying
probable fraudulent customers based on historic data analysis
this helps institutes in deciding whether to issue loan or credit cards to the applicants or not
it is used by security agencies for surveillance and monitoring purpose based on information
collected by huge number of sensors this helps in preventing any wrongdoings and or calamities
now, following are the disadvantages of data analytics this may breach privacy
of the customers as their information suggests purchases, online transactions subscriptions are
visible to their parent companies the companies may exchange these useful customer data bases for
scientists and researchers to verify or disprove scientific models, theories and hypothesis
mutual benefits the cost of data analytics tools vary based on applications and features supported
moreover, some of the data analytics tools are complex to use and require training
this increases cost to the company willing to adopt data analysis tools or software
the information obtained using data analysis can also be misused against the group of people of
certain country or community or caste it is very difficult to select the right data analysis tools
this is due to the fact that it requires knowledge of the tools and their accuracy in
analysing the relevant data as per applications this increases time and cost to the company
inside the data analysis process- data analysis applications involve more than
just analysing data particularly on advanced analysis projects, much of the required work
takes place upfront in collecting, integrating and preparing data and then developing,
data analytics is a broad term that encompasses many diverse types of data analysis, especially
testing and revising analytical models to ensure that they produce accurate results
in addition to data scientists and other data analysts,
analysis teams often include data engineers whose job is to help get data sets ready for analysis
the analysis process starts with data collection, in which data scientists identify the information
they need for a particular analysis application and then work on their own or with data engineers
and it starts to assemble it for use data from different source systems may
need to be combined via data integration routines transformed into a common format and loaded into
an analysis system such as hadoop cluster, nosql database or data warehouse
in other cases, the collection process may consist of pulling a relevant subset
out of a stream of raw data that flows into say hadoop and moving it to a separate
any type of information can be subjected to data analysis techniques, to get insight that can be
partition in the system so, it can be analysed without affecting the overall data set
once the data that's needed is in place, the next step is to find and fix data quality problems
that could affect the accuracy of analysis applications
that include running data profiling and data cleansing jobs to make sure that
the information in a data set is consistent, and that errors and duplicate entries are eliminated
additional data preparation work is then done to manipulate
and organize the data for the planned analysis use and data governance policies are applied to
ensure that the data hews to corporate standards and is being used properly
at that point, the data analysis work begins in earnest, or data scientists builds an
analytical model using predictive modelling tools or other analysis software and programming
used to improve things for example, manufacturing companies often record the runtime, downtime and
languages such as python, scalar, r and sql the model is initially run against a
partial data set to test its accuracy typically, it's then revised and tested again,
a process known as training the model that continues until it functions as intended
finally, the model is run in production mode against the full data set something that can be
done wants to address a specific information need or on an ongoing basis as the data is updated
in some cases, analysis, applications can be set to automatically trigger business actions
for example, stock trades by a financial services firm otherwise,
the last step in the data analysis process is communicating the results generated by
analytical model to business executives and other end users to aid in their decision making
that usually is done with the help of data visualization techniques, which analysis teams use
work queue for various machines and then analyse the data to better plan the workloads, so that
﻿welcome to the session on heterogeneous data and storage
a node or group of nodes fail this fault tolerance is built in on a software level
programs running in clusters must be able to dictate and recover from a fault
writing fault tolerance distributed programs is very complex
so many distributed programs use frameworks for error handling one of these framework is the
apachian map reduced model which is currently the main framework for big data processing
the key features of a distributed system are- components in the system are concurrent
a distributed system allows resource sharing including software by systems
connected to the network at the same time there can be multiple components but they will
generally be autonomous in nature a global clock is not required in a distributed system
the systems can be spread across different geographies compared to other network models,
computers and necessary hardware, software services and supporting infrastructure
there is greater fault tolerance in a distributed model price performance ratio is much better
the key goals of a distributed system include, transparency that is the ability of achieving
the image of a single system image without concealing the details of the location, access,
migration, concurrency, failure, relocation, persistence and resources to the users
openness refers to making the network easier to configure and modify reliability,
compared to a single system, a distributed system should be highly capable of being secure,
consistent and have a high capability of masking errors this is referred by the term reliability
performance compared to other models, distributed models are expected to give
a much wanted boost to performance scalability distributed system should be scalable with respect
to geography, administration or size challenges for distributed systems include,
is essential for the effective management and delivering of information
security is a big challenge in a distributed environment, especially when using public
networks fault tolerance could be tough when the distributed model is built based on
unreliable components coordination and resource sharing can be difficult if proper protocols or
policies are not in place process knowledge should be put in place for the administrators
and users of the distributed model types of distributed systems - the nodes
in the distributed systems can be arranged in the form of client server systems or peer to
peer systems client server systems in client server systems, the client request a resource
and the server provides that resource a server may serve multiple clients at the same time,
while a client is in contact with only one server both the client and the server usually
communicate via a computer network, and so they are a part of distributed systems
the use of mobile phones to make calls and send text or multimedia messages, the use of websites
peer to peer systems - the peer to peer system contains nodes that are equal participants in data
sharing all the task are equally divided between all the nodes the nodes interact with each other
as required as shared resources this is done with the help of a network advantages of distributed
systems - some advantages of distributed systems are as follows, all the nodes in the distributed
system are connected to each other so nodes can easily share data with other nodes
more nodes can easily be added to the distributed system that is it can be scaled as required
failure of one node does not lead to the failure of the entire distributed systems
other nodes can still communicate with each other resources like printers can be shared with
multiple nodes rather than being restricted to just one disadvantages of distributed systems -
some disadvantages of distributed systems are as follows, it is difficult to provide adequate
for ticket reservation and business, use of atm machines for banking and of course the
security in distributed systems because the nodes as well as the connections need to be secured
some messages and data can be lost in the network while moving from one node to another
the database connected to the distributed systems is quite complicated and difficult to handle as
compared to a single user system overloading may occur in the network if all the nodes of
the distributed system try to send data at once heterogeneous distributed dbms heterogeneous
systems usually result when individual sites have implemented their own database and integration
is considered at a later stage in a heterogeneous system, translations
are required to allow communication between different dbmss to provide dbms transparency,
users must be able to make request in the language of the dbms at their locker site
the system then has the task of locating the data and performing any necessary translation
social media requires enormous storage facility to store different kinds of data or information
data maybe required from another site that may have different hardware,
different dbms products or different hardware and different dbms products
if the hardware is different, but the dbms products are the same,
the translation is straight forward involving the change of codes and word langs if the
dbms products are different, the translation is complicated involving the mapping of the data
structure in one data model to the equivalent data structures in another data model for example,
relations in the relational data model are mapped to records and sets in the network model
it is also necessary to translate the query languages used for example, sql select statements
are mapped to network find and get statements if both the hardware and software are different,
then these two types of translation are required this makes the processing extremely complex
this leads to big data and cloud services heterogeneous storage - large scale storage
the typical solution used by some relational systems that are part of heterogeneous dbms is
to use gateways which convert the language and model of each different dbms into the
language and model of the relational system types of heterogeneous distributed databases are
federated the heterogeneous database systems are independent in nature
and integrated together so that they function as a single database system un-federated - the
database systems employ a central coordinating module through which the databases are accessed
big data - big data is a term used to describe data sets that are too big to process using traditional
methods a study by lany has identified three dimensions that force companies to adopt new
architectural solutions and trade-offs volume - the amount of data has massively
increased over the last decade e-commerce for example logs and processors,
systems are crucial components in the data intensive applications
all use the transactions which leads to ten times as much data as traditional sales the scale at
which data is stored and processed has moved from gigabytes to terabytes and terabytes to petabytes
velocity - the speed at which data is processed has increased and the expected response time has
lowered companies move from periodic batch processing to
near real time or real time processing for example, moving from product recommendations
in ecommerce with which has a relatively static product catalogue to recommendations
for new articles which change by minute or stock options which change every second
variety - the sources of data have become more valid in terms of data structure format
and semantics these three aspects are commonly referred to as the three vs of big data
other authors have added more vs such as value, which represents the increased financial gain
such as search engine clusters, video on demand servers, sensor networks and grid computing
companies have from their data veracity, which represents the unreliability
of big data sources and volatility which refers to how long data is valid
and relevant because of these new challenges a demand has risen for systems that handle data in
new ways examples of approaches are taking samples of the data process only a fraction of all
data investing in more powerful infrastructure and using different algorithms for data processing
compared to traditional relational database management systems that rely on row based
storage and expensive caching strategies these novel big data storage technologies offer
better scalability at lower operational complexity and cost despite these advances
that improve the performance scalability and usage ability of storage technologies,
there is still significant untapped potential for big data storage technologies both for using and
a storage server typically consists of a set of storage devices in such systems, data layouts
further developing the technologies potential to transform society and business across sectors
big data storage technologies are a key enabler for advanced analytics
that have the potential to transform society and the way key business decisions are made
this is of particular importance in traditionally non it based sectors such as energy
while these sectors face non technical issues such as the lack of skilled big data experts
and regulatory barriers, novel data storage technologies have the potential to enable
new value generating analytics in and across various industrial sectors
lack of standards is a major barrier the history of nosql is based on
solving specific technological challenges which led to a range of different storage technologies
the large range of choices coupled with the lack of standards for querying the data makes it harder
may need to be reconfigured over time for load balancing or in the event of system failure or
the advancements in computers and information technology makes the world changing drastically
to exchange data stores as it may tie application specific code to certain storage location
open scalability challenges in graph based data sources
processing data based on graph data structures is beneficial in an increasing amount of
applications it allows better capture of semantics and complex relationships
with other pieces of information coming from a large variety of data sources
and has the potential to improve the overall value that can be generated by analyzing the data
while graph data bases are increasingly used for this purpose,
it remains hard to efficiently distribute graph based data structures across computing nodes
privacy and security is lagging behind although there are several projects and
solutions that address privacy and security, the protection of individuals and securing their data
upgrades it is critical to migrate data to their target locations as quickly as possible
lags behind the technological advances of data storage systems considerable research
is required to better understand how data can be misused, how it need to be protected
and integrated in big data storage solutions it is time to conclude the session information
provides the power to find and evaluate problems and make decisions effectively
every aspects of life is getting changed due to the enhancement in
technology which helps to collect more information and process this huge quantity of data very fast
the storage requirements and the availability of stored information play
an important role in this hence this module tries to find
the storage of different kinds of data and techniques used to make them available as and when
needed hope you enjoyed this session see you next time until then, bye
to obtain the best performance a storage node however can typically handle multiple transfers
simultaneously and this can reduce the total migration time significantly
moreover, storage devices tend to have heterogeneous capabilities as devices maybe added
over time due to the increase in storage demand the data replication mechanism
of the storage system will have a great impact on system performance
the key points involved in the placement of data replicas in heterogeneous storage systems
include the determination of the number of data replication and the location of storage
the number of replicas has great influence on the data availability of distributed storage systems
few replicas could easily lead to overhead of partial replicas and overload of storage nodes
technology is the knowledge generated for the purpose of developing new
if the number of replicas is large, the storage resources will be wasted heterogeneous storage
systems choosing those nodes with different performance and the different locations were
replica storage effects the quality of service when replicas are assessed
the current replication placement strategies can be divided into
the source request placement strategy, priority placement strategy,
path placement strategy, neighbor node placement strategy and random placement strategy etcetera
light weight adaptive replication is a typical source request placement strategy
the advantage is that the new replication creation mechanism is triggered when the
exiting nodes reach the placement threshold which reduces the creation of redundant replicas
thus, reduces the cost of replication creation and maintenance the disadvantage is that the load of
systems to help in solving practical problems in the current scenario,
the storage node is easily exceeded resulting in the unbalance load of the overall system
the advantage of priority placement is that when an axis request arise at the target storage node,
the other storage nodes will transfer the same replication to the visited node as a result,
the number of storage nodes is reduced the disadvantage is that the hotspot are
easily generated and the overall system load is unbalanced
the path placement strategy is simple and convenient method to query all nodes on the
request path when users access the replication but it is easy to cause the data redundancy
which increases the waste of storage resources and the maintenance cost of replication consistency
the neighbor node placement is mainly to save the history of the replication access
when a certain node is requested to reach the threshold, it selects the
the impact of technology can be seen in all areas like home, office and market
neighbor node as the new storage and makes the node access to the neighbor node
the advantage of random placement is load balancing, hence reducing access latency
the shortcoming is that the number of replicas is too large
heterogeneous data - heterogeneous data are any data with high variability of data types
and formats they are possibly ambiguous and low quality due to missing values,
high data redundancy and untruthfulness it is difficult to integrate heterogeneous data
to meet the business information demands there are different types of data heterogeneity
such as syntactic heterogeneity occurs when two data sources are not expressed in the same
language conceptual heterogeneity also known as semantic heterogeneity or logical mismatch
denotes the differences in modeling the same domain of interest technologically heterogeneity
data collection, storage and analysis can easily be carried out with the help of technology
stands for variations in names when referring to the same entities from different data sources
semiotic heterogeneity also known as pragmatic heterogeneity stands for different interpretation
for entities by people data representation levels - data representation can be described
at four levels level one is reverse raw data with different types and form different sources
level two is called unified representation heterogeneous data needs to be unified
also too much data can lead to high cognitive and data processing costs this layer converts
individual attributes into information in terms of ‘what-when-where’
level three is aggregation spatial data can be naturally represented in the form of spatial grids
with thematic attributes processing operators are segmentation and aggregation etcetera
aggregation aids easy visualization and provides an intuitive query level four is
with the huge amount of data collected, we are able to analyze and predict the weather,
called situation detection and representation the situation at a location is characterized based on
spatiotemporal descriptors determined by using appropriate operators at level three
spatiotemporal means that they should take care of both time and space related information
a typical example is tracking of moving objects which occupies a single position at a given time
the final step in situation detection is a classification operation that uses domain
knowledge to assign an appropriate class to each cell metadata - metadata are crucial for future
coding for relational tables and some extensible markup language that is xml documents explicit
schema definitions in structured query language, sql, xml schema definition xsd or document type
definition dtd can be directly obtained from sources and integrated into a meta model
the xml technique is used for data translation the tricky part is semi structured data such as
model space exploration and many more information is essential in all these applications,
xml without xsd, json or partially structured excel or csd files which contain implicit schemas
therefore the competence structural meta data discovery, that is smd
takes over the responsibility of discovering implicit metadata example entity types,
relationship types and constraints from semi structured data metadata management
issues are important for an appropriate interpretation of heterogeneous big data,
detailed metadata are required some reports contain some metadata, but many more
details such as about the specific sensor used in data collection are needed for research purposes
the collection of metadata and data provinces is a major challenge when the data are collected
under stressful situations distributed systems - the term distributed systems refers to a networked
set of hardware or software components that communicate only by message passing
since information gathering is easier in these days, we are often facing with information over
unlike many other forms of parallel computing, distributed systems do not have access to
a shared memory the lack of shared memory allows them to be more scalable but introduces new
problems with concurrency, timing, network failures and independent node failures
the term can be used for a large variety of appliances such as sensor networks,
the bit coin network and distributed databases due to the large amount of nodes in clusters,
single node failures occur very frequently google reported a mean time to failure that is
mttf of four point three months for servers in their data centers for a cluster with ten
thousand nodes, this translate to an average of one node failing per twenty minutes because of
the high frequency of node failures, the cluster must be fault tolerant to be practically useful
data stored in the cluster should not get lost and processing should not be interrupted when
load and storage of information is crucial information processing is mainly done with
welcome to the session on e-library
structured approach - digital library provides access to much richer content in a more structured
manner, that is we can easily move from the catalogue to the particular book, then to
a particular chapter and so on
information retrieval - the user is able to use any search term belonging to the word
or phrase of the entire collection
digital library will provide very user friendly interfaces giving clickable access to its
resources
preservation and conservation - an exact copy of the original can be made any number of
times without any degradation in quality
space - various traditional libraries are limited by storage space
digital libraries can largely differ in terms of size, scope and purpose
digital libraries have the potential to store much more information simply because digital
information requires very little physical space to contain them
when the library had no space for extension, digitization is the only solution
networking - a particular digital library can provide the link to any other resources
of other digital library very easily
thus, a seamlessly integrated resource sharing can be achieved
cost - the cost of maintaining a digital library is much lower than that of a traditional library
a traditional library must spend large sums of money paying for staff, book, maintenance,
rent and additional books
digital libraries do away with these fees
they may be maintained by institutions, organizations, or even individuals
disadvantages of the digital library - the computer viruses, lack of standardization
for digitized information, quick degrading properties of digitized material, different
display standard of digital product and its associated problem, health hazard, nature
of the radiation from monitor etcetera makes digital libraries at time handicapped
copyright - digitization violates the copyright law as the thought content of one author can
be freely transfer by other without his acknowledgement
so, one difficulty to overcome for digital libraries is the way to distribute information
speed of access - as more and more computers are connected to the internet, its speed of
access reasonably decreasing
if new technology will not evolve to solve the problem then in near future internet will
several institutions mostly academic have already started to maintain digital libraries
be full of error messages
initial cost is high - the infrastructure cost of digital library that is the cost of
hardware, software, leasing communication circuit is generally very high
bandwidth - digital library will need high bandwidth for transfer of multimedia resources,
but the bandwidth is decreasing day by day due to its over utilization
efficiency - with a much larger volume of digital information, finding the right material
for a specific task becomes increasingly difficult
environment - digital libraries cannot reproduce the environment of a traditional library
many people also find reading, printed material to be easier than reading material on a computer
screen
difference between digital and traditional libraries - the most major difference between
preservation - due to technological developments a digital library can rapidly become out of
date and its data may become inaccessible
requirement for digital libraries - the internet and world wide web provides the motivation
and technological environment for the development and operation of a digital library
the internet provides the tcp ip and or its associated protocol for accessing the information
and web provide tools and techniques for publishing the information over internet
in the digital environment it is reasonable to say that a central backup or archive should
be created at the national level which will store information output of the region as
well as information from outside the country
some of the requirement for a digital libraries are audio visuals - color tv, vcr, dvds, sound
digital and traditional forms of libraries are being local versus being global
box, telephone, etcetera
computer - server, pc with multimedia, ups, etcetera
network - lan, wan, man, internet, etcetera
printer - laser printer, dot matrix printers, bar code printer, digital graphic printer,
etcetera
scanner - scanjet, flatbed, sheet feeder, drum scanner, slide scanner, microfilming
scanner, digital camera, barcode scanner, etcetera
storage devices - optical storage devices, cd rom, jukebox, etcetera
software - any suitable software which is interconnected and suitable for lan and wan
connections
being local versus being global - being out of place is one of the general feature of internet
software - there a number of software packages for use in general digital libraries for notable
one see digital library software
institutional repository software which focuses primarily in just preservation and accessible
locally produced documents particularly locally produced academic outputs can be found in
institutional repository software
open source software for library automation
koha – integrated library system - koha is a promising full featured open source ils
that is integrated library system currently being used by libraries all over the world
for those who you out there unfamiliar of what an ils is, well, this is a system of
keeping track of the operations of a library, payroll, expenses, purchases and most importantly
with the advent of network to communication and possibility of resource retrieve through
keeping track of the various media being shared out by the librarians patterns
many smaller libraries cannot afford to purchase install and maintain an ils and koha is a
perfect alternative
koha is built using library ils standards and uses the opac, open public access catalogue
interface
in addition, koha has no vendor login
so libraries can receive text support from any party they choose
newgenlib - newgenlib or new generation library is an integrated library automation and networking
solution developed by various solution private limited and the keshavan institute of information
and knowledge management india
network, active domains of libraries change to be globalised both in collection and services
in march two thousand five, newgenlib version one was released and the versions two point
zero and two point one have come up later
on ninth january, two thousand eight, newgenlib has been declared open source software under
gnu gpl license by the various solution private limited hyderabad, india
evergreen - evergreen ils is another option when researching open source ils options
developed by equinox software, evergreen is a robust enterprise level ils solution developed
to be capable of supporting the work load of large libraries in a fault-tolerant system
it too is standards compliant and uses the opac interface and offers many features including
flexible administration, work flow customization, adaptable programming interfaces and because
its open source cannot be locked away and can benefit from any community contributions
just in case versus just in time - usually collection development is continuous process
retrieval support functions of the electronic library system
bibliographic data retrieval - bibliographic data retrieval is a well known function that
is provided by existing library catalogue systems and online data retrieval systems
the user can retrieve bibliographic data to find a book, even if some of its title or
the name, publisher’s name, publishing year, number of pages and price are not known exactly
the result of a retrieval can be displayed not only as a list of bibliographic data,
but also as a list of cover images
hypertext retrieval - important data and concepts retained in the electronic library system
are linked to groups of other data which can be located anywhere in the world
this function enables the user to skip from one concept or term found in the current position
to achieve library’s prophecy aim
e-libraries are also referred to as virtual libraries, e-library system or digital libraries
of a book two* and other position by the same concept or term appears elsewhere in the same
book or paper
skip from one book or paper to another book or paper stored in another library
jump from a list of bibliographical data, to an introduction of the author or the table
of contents or a position in the text of a book
jump from a book or paper directly to a coded document
check unknown meaning of term found in a book
keyword retrieval - keyword retrieval enables the user to retrieve books and papers by inputting
a keyword defined by the user
after full text retrieval, the result is displayed as a list of books in which books are listed
if library could not provide needed resources, it will not be able to meet uses requisition
according to closest match with the users request
display items can include also an indication of the context in which the word appears
retrieval using term hierarchy - the user can retrieve data to find a book or paper
by using a retrieval expression describing a hierarchical structure for books and paper
in addition to the retrieval of its title or the name or publisher’s name
the roles of digital libraries in teaching and learning - a library is fundamentally
an organized set of resources which include human services as well as the entire spectrum
of media, example text, video and hyper media
libraries have physical components such as space, equipment and storage media
intellectual components such as collection policies that determine what materials will
instantly
be included and organizational schemes that determine how the collection is accessed and
people who manage the physical and intellectual components and interact with users to solve
information problems
libraries serve at least three roles in learning
first they serve a practical role in sharing expensive resources
physical resources such as books and periodicals, films and videos, software and electronic
databases and specialized tools such as projectors, graphics equipment and cameras are shared
by a community of users
human resources and librarians also called media specialist or information specialist
support instructional programs by responding to request of teachers and students
in other words trend to develop collection in non electronic libraries tend to be when
that is responsive service
and by initiating activities for teachers and students which is a proactive service
responsive services include maintaining reserve materials, answering reference questions,
providing bibliographic instruction, developing media packages, recommending books of films
and teaching users how to use materials
proactive services include selective dissemination of information to faculty and students initiating
thematic events, collaborating with instructor to plan instruction and introducing new instructional
methods and tools
in these ways, libraries save to allow instructors and students to share expensive materials
and expertise
needed
second, libraries serve a cultural role in preserving and organizing artifacts and ideas
great works of literature, art and science must be preserved and made accessible to future
learners, although libraries have traditionally been viewed as facilities for printed artifacts
primary and secondary school libraries often also serve as museums and laboratories
libraries preserve objects through caf storage procedures, policies of borrowing and use,
and repair and maintenance as needed
in addition to preservation, libraries ensure access to materials through indexes, catalogues
and other finding aids that allow learners to locate items appropriate to their needs
third, libraries serve social and intellectual roles in bringing together people and ideas
this is distinct from the practical role of sharing resources in that libraries provide
but because of resource recall possibility from remote access, future tendency of collection
a physical place for teachers and learners to meet outside the structure of the classroom
thus, allowing people with different perspectives, to interact in a knowledge space that is both
larger and more general than that shared by any single discipline or affinity group
browsing a catalogue in a library provides a global view for people engaged in specialized
study and offers opportunities for insights or alternative views
in many respects, libraries serve as condense of inter disciplinary
places shared by learners from all disciplines
digital libraries extend such inter disciplinary by making diverse information resources available
beyond the physical space shared by groups of learners
one of the greatest benefits of digital libraries is bringing together people with formal, informal
development will be directed to be just in time
and professional learning missions
formal learning is systematic and guided by instructions
formal learning take place in courses offered at schools of various kinds and in training
courses, or programs on the job
the important roles that libraries serve in formal learning are illustrated by their physical
prominence on university campuses and the number of courses that make direct use of
library services and materials
most of the information resources in schools are tied directly to the instructional mission
students or teachers who wish to find information outside this mission have in the past had
to travel to other libraries
this orientation emphasis on immediate and satisfying response to users queries
by making the broad range of information resources discussed below available to students and
teachers in schools, digital libraries open new learning opportunities for global rather
than strictly local communities
much learning in life is informal or opportunistic and strictly under the control of the learners
learners take advantage of other people, mass media and the immediate environment during
informal learning
public libraries provide classic non-fiction books, a wide range of periodicals, reference
resources and audio and video tapes, so that patterns can learn about topics of their own
choosing at their own place and style
just as computing technology and worldwide telecommunication networks are beginning to
although both of when needed and just in time trends are equally important, but according
change what is possible in formal classrooms, they are changing how individuals pursue personal
learning missions
professional learning refers to the ongoing learning adults engage into do their work
and to improve their work related knowledge and skills
in fact, for many professionals, learning is the central aspect of their work
like informal learning that is mainly self directed, but unlike formal or informal learning,
it is focused on a specific field closely linked to job performance, aims to be comprehensive
and is acquired and applied longitudinally
since professional learning effects job performance, co-operations and government agencies support
libraries often called information centers with information resources specific to the
to collection development policy for libraries must be decided to manage and balance between
goals of the organization
the main information resources for professional learning however are personal collections
of books, reports and files, subscription to journals and the human networks of colleagues
nurtured through professional meetings and various communications
many of the datasets and computational tools of digital libraries were originally developed
to enhance professional learning
digital library initiatives in india - india is in the experimental stages of digital libraries
a majority of libraries provide bibliographic access only
the health education library for people help mumbai, the dera institute of fundamental
research, difr mumbai, iit kharagpur and national centre for science information ncsi bangalore
them
these libraries consist of a collection of digital resources that may have existed only
are some exceptions
iaslic list and the list forum along with the electronic newsletter infowatch provide
professional information
information today and tomorrow, inflibnet newsletter and the desidock bulletin of information
technology the bit are a few other sources of current information on the use of icts
and networks in india
research and developmental activities regarding digital libraries are being undertaken in
some institutions for example, the indian national scientific documentation centre,
niscair new delhi
a brief account of some of the resources and services is presented here

digital archives
archives differ from libraries in several ways
traditionally archives were defined as containing primary sources of information typically letters
be stored in networked computers
and papers directly produced by an individual or organization rather than the secondary
sources found in a library, like books, papers, journals and so on
having their contents organized in groups rather than individual items, whereas books
in a library are catalogued individually, items in an archive are typically grouped
by provinces the individual or organizations who created them, an original order, the order
in which the materials were kept by the creator
having unique contents, whereas a book may be found at many different libraries depending
on its rarity the records in an archive are usually one of a kind and cannot be found
or consulted at any other location except at the archive that hold them
the technology used to create digital libraries has been even more revolutionary for the archives
maybe it seems that to meet urgent needs of users, accessibility is more important than
since it breaks down the second and third of these general rules
the use of search engines, optical character recognition and metadata allow digital copies
of individual items such as letters to be catalogued and the ability to remotely access
digital copies has removed the necessity of physically going to a particular archive to
find a particular set of records
the oxford text archive is generally considered to be the oldest digital archive of academic
primary source materials
a digital library is a collection of documents in organized electronic form available on
the internet or on cd rom
depending on the specific library, a user maybe able to access magazine, articles, books,
ownership, but it is not true
papers, images, sound files and videos
some institutions have begun the task of converting classic books to electronic format for distribution
on the internet
some files can be viewed directly in html format, other can be downloaded in pdf format
and printed
the new generation is fond of digital media than books and hard copies
hence the e-library or the digital library provides better experience in seeking knowledge
hence in this module, we have discussed some of the important characteristics of e-library
hope you enjoyed this session
see you next time, until then, bye
ownership and accessibility are complementary of each other
if a library just notice to accessibility and forgets ownership, it will remain only
as a network
in this manner, resources will be exclusive to publishers and the library will change
to be lifeless and ghostly systems with some old and out of date resources
in digital form or have been converted from another form to digital
also reading electronic resources are without enough qualification and enjoyable sense of
reading printing resources for some of readers, especially in field of literature and history
including printed and digital resources in a same time, library could serve to clients
with different interest
separation versus coordination - digital library users do not need to have physical attending
in library to earn information
most of the time, library provides valid information access more than merely circulation of materials
in addition to collection of data, the library by organizing resources in networks directly
or indirectly
make collection accessible for users it can be said, it is vital for libraries to collect and organize digital works virtually
these resources are generally stored in a broad range of formats and can be accessed
through networked communication
it cost for example, cataloging and document delivery services come closer to expanding
collection more than before
therefore gaps have been reduced between technical services and public services to users and
at the end it is not out of mind to integrate each other
acceleration of information circulations - in networks, every author is publisher too
information circulates in the moment of time, creating and sharing information become more
faster than preceding
this high speed of information circulation has challenges for libraries
because of that they must have new strategically planning view to collection via internet
by users over a computer network
five concepts of electronically digital library system – digital- an electronic library
has not only text data but also sound, graphics and motion video in the form of digital data
because all data is digitalized, various kinds of data can be merged easily and a high level
of retrieval and other processing can be done
network - when electronic libraries of this kind appear in many places and are linked
to each other via a network, a huge virtual library is built on the network
it is a world library which process national borders regardless of the distances between
actual electronic libraries
interactive - the electronic library system provides the latest functions as well as allowing
books to be displayed on screen as if they were printed books
such libraries have many advantages in that
the system makes advances in retrieving books and papers
the system enables the user to display multiple books on a single screen and skip from one
part describing an idea to a link describing the same idea within an another book
it enables the user also to reference dictionaries and thesauruses simultaneously to check any unknown
terms, attach notes and tabs to various positions in a book
translate original text and output text as voice data
multimedia - the user of the electronic library system can use data in different format such
as text, sound, graphics and motion video
this multimedia data is more understandable than conventional books containing only text,
diagrams and tables
they can be updated on a daily basis and can be accessed instantly by users
scalable - the electronic library system can be used to build an electronic library in
various sizes according to the available hardware, software and data resources
the electronic library can be as large as a national library and as small as a personal
library
advantages of the digital library - a digital library is not confined to a particular location
or so called building
it is virtually distributed all over the world
the user can get his or her information on his own computer screen by using the internet
actually it’s a network of multimedia system which provides finger tip access
the spoken words or the graphical display of a digital library is again having a different
additionally they do not have a physical boundary, can store more information and offer access
impact from the words that are printed
in the new environment or into a document will not be a problem for the library because
the user will pay for its uses
no physical boundary
the user of a digital library need not go to the library physically
people from all over the world could gain access information as long as an internet
connection is available
round the clock availability - digital libraries can be accessed at any time, twenty four hours
a day and three sixty five days of the year
multiple access - the same resources can be used at the same time by a number of users
to multiple resources simultaneously
﻿welcome to the session on google scholar
scholar allows for you to see articles related to the one that might interest you, how many times an
article has been cited and by whom, and provide citations for articles in a number of styles
google scholar can display links to articles and books held through ecu libraries
google scholar allows you to save both citation and articles to read later
disadvantages of using google scholar - google scholar’s coverage is wide-ranging
but not comprehensive it can be a research source, but should not be the only source
you use google scholar does not provide the criteria for what makes its results ‘scholarly’
results are often vary in quantity and it is up to the researcher to determine which of the
results are suitable for their purposes google scholar does not allow users to limit results to
either peer reviewed or full text materials or by discipline google scholar does not provide
two thousand four, the google scholar index includes most peer reviewed online
notice of when its materials are updated google scholar’s citation tracker can be
difficult to use and inaccurate optimizing files for google scholar -
based on the definition of search engine optimization for web pages, seo we define
academy search engine optimization aseo as follows academic search engine optimization,
aseo, is the creation, publication and modification of scholarly literature in a way
that makes it easier for academic search engines to both crawl it and index it the basic concept
of keyword based searching is the same for all major or academic search engines
users search for a search term in a certain document field example title, abstract, body
text or in all fields and all documents containing the search term are listed on the results page
academic search engines use different ranking algorithms to determine
academy journals and books, conference papers, thesis and dissertation , preprints, abstracts,
in which position the results are displayed some let the user choose one factor on which to rank,
there is common ranking factors or publication date, citation count, author or journal name and
reputation and relevance of the document others combined the ranking factors into
one algorithm and more often than not, the user has no influence on the factors weighting
the relevance of a document is basically a function of
how often the search term occurs in that document and in which part of the document it occurs
generally speaking, the more often a search term occurs in the document and the more important
the document field is in which that term occurs, the more relevant the document is considered this
means that an occurrence in the title is weighted more heavily than an occurrence in the abstract,
which carries more weight than an occurrence in a subheading than in the body text and so on
technical reports and others scholarly literature, including court opinion and patents
in this session, we will discuss the most important considerations to help ensure
your work is visible in google scholar abstract and metadata - metadata completeness for pdfs and
other electronic files is particularly important it provides extra context for the search engine,
indicating what your document is about and how it relates to other articles essential
elements of metadata for academic work are title, author names, abstract, keywords,
author and user related, publication name, social annotations, description, file name, and uri
google's algorithm will look for keywords and phrases used in the main body of the article,
as well as tables, figures, and sub headings to identify the most relevant articles for
users searched, but taking the time to include carefully considered metadata makes it that
bit easier for google scholar to get your article in front of people searching on that topic
while google does not publish the size of google scholars database, scientometric,
the abstract is also really important because google scholar uses it to form the
meta description just as a researcher will decide whether to delve into a full academic paper based
on the abstract, the meta description is your opportunity to encourage readers to click through
from the search results in the first place google's meta descriptions can be up to two
thirty characters long this means that while the full abstract can of course be as long as needed
its worth considering how the first two thirty characters will look in the meta description
and how effectively this description will draw in readers we recommend putting the most important
information first summing up the contents of words and what the user will gain from reading it
types of graphics - images in articles should be vector graphics,
which are made up of straight and curved lines, rather than raster, which are made up of pixels
researchers, estimated it to contain roughly three eighty nine million documents including
the reason for using vector over raster graphics is that text cannot be read by search engines,
if it is housed in a raster format this means any text included in the raster graphic
won't do anything to help the article rank more prominently in the google scholar results
and ideally you want every bit of your article to contribute relevance for the different search
queries that might lead a person to your work the following formats are examples of vector graphics
dot svg, dot ai, dot eps and dot ps citation details and count - as mentioned,
your citations are very important for helping articles to rank well in google scholar to ensure
google scholar can understand the relation between your articles and the work cited within them
you should ensure author names and publication names are always cited in the exact same way and
that the reference list for the full article is labeled with a clear subheading you should also
articles, citations and patents, making it the world's largest academic search engine
ensure the formatting of author and publication information is aligned across the article
itself and in the metadata of the file all this maximizes the potential for your papers to rank
prominently when people search for academic work using author and publication names
in this module, google scholar and its characteristics are
discussed in detail this module gives an account of the fundamental concepts in google scholar
ranking algorithm we also discussed various advantages and limitations of google scholar
in detail the module ends by referring various techniques to optimize a search
in january, two thousand eighteen previously, the size was estimated at one sixty million documents
as of may, two thousand fourteen earlier statistical estimate published
in, plos one, which is a peer reviewed open access journal,
using a mark and recapture method estimated approximately eighty to ninety percentage
we have already seen that the advancements in information technology has a great impact
coverage of all articles published in english, with an estimate of hundred million
this estimate also determined how many documents were freely available on the web
google scholar is similar in function to the freely available citeseerx and getcited it also
resembles the subscription based tools elsevier scopus and clarivate analytics, web of science
google scholar has been criticized for not weighting journals and including
predatory journals in its index useful features and specifications - google
scholar combines some features to make it easy to identify a range of related publications
across a topic area and extract citations in many standard styles and formats
related articles - if you find a useful article,
you can click the related articles link to see more like it it's important to not,
on every phase of research there are different applications and facilities
however, that google scholar does not clarify what algorithm it uses to determine related articles
cited by - clicking the cited by link, lets you see where an article has been cited this
is a helpful tool for uncovering more potentially relevant journal articles or other documents
citation formatting - to see the citation formatted in mla, apa, chicago, harvard and
vancouver styles, simply click on the quote icon you can then copy and paste the citation into your
document or export it to your bibliography manager relevant research - google scholar
lets you follow research that is related to a specific author’s work, to do so, click follow
on the authors public profile page and then select new articles related to this author's research
whenever an article is published related to the author's work, you will get an email alert
google scholar allows users to search for digital or physical copies of articles, whether online
to help researchers in the process of data collection and analysis of data
or in libraries it indexes full text journal articles, technical reports, preprints, thesis,
books and other documents including selected web pages that are deemed to be scholarly
because many of google scholar search results link to commercial journal articles, most people will
be able to access only an abstract and the citation details of an article and have to
pay a fee to access the entire article the most relevant results for the search keyword will be
listed first in order of the authors ranking the number of references that are linked to it and
they relevance to other scholarly literature and the ranking of the publication that the
journal appears in using its group of feature it shows the available links to journal articles
in the two thousand five version this feature provided a link to both
subscription access version of an article and to free full text version of articles,
some applications are helpful in data collection, while others are used for analysis and some others
for most of two thousand six, it provided links to only the publishers versions
since december two thousand six, it has provided links to both published versions and major open
access repositories, but still does not cover those posted on individual faculty web pages,
access to such self archiving non-subscription versions is now provided by a link to google,
where one can find such open access articles with it cited by feature google scholar provides
access to abstracts of articles that have cited the article being viewed
it is this feature in particular that provides the citation indexing previously only found in
elsevier, scopus and web of science with its ‘related articles’ feature,
google scholar presents a list of closely related articles, ranked primarily by how similar these
articles are to the original result but also taking into account the relevance of each paper
are used at the time of publishing google scholar is one such type of facility, which is a search
google scholar’s legal database of us cases is extensive,
users can search and read published opinions of us state appellate, and supreme court cases,
since nineteen fifty, us federal district appellate, tax and bankruptcy records since
nineteen twenty three, and the us supreme court cases, since nineteen seventy one
google scholar embeds clickable citation links within the case and the house cited tab allows
lawyers to research prior case law and the subsequent citations to the court decision
the google scholar legal content star paginator extension inserts
westlaw, and lexisnexis style page numbers in line with the text of the case
the ranking algorithm - link analysis is an important tool used by web search engines,
while it also plays a part in the study of citations among scientific papers and journals
engine that covers scholarly literature, including peer reviewed papers, thesis,
the standard measure of citation impact factor is the average number of citations, received by
a paper in the given journal over the past two years here, the average attention paid by the
academic community to papers published in the journal serves the role of voting by in links
google scholar however combines the traits of web search engine and citation
analysis and is different from both google's ranking function for web search
is believed to involve pagerank, as well as non-pagerank methods developed on hubs and
authorities, while google scholar, like citation analysis deals with journal articles that have
with no in-links, or out-links, rather than webs citation play the same role in links play
in-link analysis and do so in a more explicit way, they directly show what other articles have
influenced one article and citation counts can be easily used to show how
books, abstracts and technical reports google scholar - google scholar is a freely
many times one article has been endorsed as a research by bill and gibb found out the
citation counts of an article is the highest ranking factor in the ranking of articles in
google scholar also, the occurrence of a search term in an article’s title has a strong impact on
the articles ranking while the impact of search term frequencies in an articles full text is weak
on the other hand, google scholar does not seem to use the principles of repeated improvement as
citations from high impact journals are count in the same way as citation from low impact ones
in the same way as web page authors would try to understand ranking functions of
web search engine to make their pages rank higher, scholars may also utilize
knowledge of the ranking algorithm of google scholar to make their article appear the first
and since the factors in ranking algorithm of google scholar are more controllable than those
accessible web search engine that indexes the full text or metadata of scholarly literature,
in normal web search, scholars may do so, simply by using relevant words in the title
as much as possible and increase self citation or citation alliances
on the other hand, the reliability of google scholar as an information source is still debated
and researchers would use the same knowledge to determine
the usefulness of articles found on google scholar thus, there will be
a balance in the end between cost and benefits of making paper rank higher on google scholar
advantages and limitations of google scholar - advantages of using google scholar-
google scholar is familiar and relatively simple to use, much like google
google scholar allows users to search for a find a wide variety of materials, including articles,
books, “grey literature” like conference proceedings on a vast number of topics google
across an array of publishing formats and disciplines released in beta in november
hello, welcome to today’s session it fundamentals spss,
you could then ask them to hold a hot corn and, again, measure the perception of pain
imagine i was a participant, i would have a single row representing my data
so there would be different column for my name, my gender, my pain perception for cold
water and my pain perception for a hot corn
reshma, female, seven, ten, the data editor is made up of lots of cells, which are boxes,
in which data values can be placed
when a cell is active, it becomes highlighted in orange
to enter a number into the data editor simply move to the cell in which you want to place
the data value, type the value, then press the appropriate row button for the direction
in which you wish to move
these data may come from basically any source, scientific research, a customer database,
the variables view - before we input any data into the data editor, we need to create the
variables
to create variables we use the variable view of the data editor
to access this view, click on the variable view tab at the bottom of the data editor
the contents of the window will change as shown in the figure
the spss viewer - alongside the spss data editor window, there was a second window known
as the spss viewer, the spss viewer displays all of the output from spss like analysis
results, graph, error messages, etcetera
the following figure shows the basic layout of the viewer window
on the right hand side there is a large space in which the output is displayed, the spss
google analytics, or even the server log files of the website
displays both graphs and the results of statistical analysis in this part of the viewer
it is also possible to edit a graph or table by double clicking on it
there is a tree diagram on the left hand side of the viewer that displays the structure
of the output
this tree diagram provides an easy way of accessing specific parts of the output which
is useful when you have conducted several analyses, the tree structure is fairly self
explanatory
every time you do something in spss, such as drawing a graph, or running a statistical
procedure, it lists this procedure as a main heading
if you want to share your spss output with other people you don't have spss statistics
spss can open all file formats that are commonly used for structured data such as spreadsheets
installed, you have two choices, export the output into a software package that they do
have such as microsoft word or any portable document format pdf
the syntax editor - spss syntax is the language of commands for carrying out statistical analysis
and data manipulations
most of the time you will do the things you need to use using spss dialog boxes, but spss
syntax can be useful
for one thing, there are certain things you can do with syntax that you can't do through
dialog boxes
the second reason for using syntax is if you often carry out very similar analysis on data sets
in these situations, it is often quicker to do the analysis and save the syntax, as you
go along
the syntax window has a navigation area, rather like the viewer window
when you have a larger file of syntax command this navigation area can be helpful for negotiating
your way to the bit of syntax that you actually need
once you've typed in your syntax, you have to turn it using the run menu or syntax window
top under syntax window with some syntax in its bottom is given in the figure
saving and retrieving file - when attempting to save files from the spss software, it is
important to first remember that the only information that is saved is what it in the
current windows
for example, if the currently displayed window contains the output from an analysis, the
the spss model - spss has similarities to both spreadsheet applications and databases
only information that will be contained in the resulting file is the output
the information from the data editor will not be saved
in order to save the information from the data editor, it must be active window by selecting
the window at the top of the screen and then selecting the data editor
once the data editor has been made, the active window, it can be saved as well
after selecting save or save as, the save dialog box will appear
the name of the data file can be entered in the box labeled file name and the directory
in which the file is saved can be changed by selecting the down arrow on the right side
of the box labeled save in
you can save data in formats, other than spss, three of the most useful are microsoft excel
spss requires you to create a database and then perform statistical manipulations with
files xls, xlsx, comma separated values csv and tab delimited text dat
navigate to wherever you save the files and open it
well, now let us summarize the session
spss is a window based program that can be used to perform data entry and analysis and
to create tables and graphs
in this module, the basic concepts of spss software is introduced, this module gives
an account of the spss model and various windows in it
the module also explains the data editor, the spss viewer and the syntax editor in detail
saving, and retrieving of spss files are also discussed in the last session
the data
thank you for watching today's program
hope the session was enriching
goodbye
the key difference between spss and these other applications is spss is designed for
statistical analysis
thus, it has far better and more efficient statistical capabilities than most spreadsheet
statistical package for the social sciences
and database applications
analyzing data with spss is relatively easy
you will need to complete several steps to perform your analysis
get your data into spss, you can open a previously saved spss data file, read a spreadsheet,
de base or text data file or enter your data directly in the data editor
select a procedure from the menus to calculate statistics or create a charts
you can select a procedure to perform statistical analysis or select a procedure to create high
resolution charts
select the variables you want to use in the analysis
the variables in the data file are displayed in a dialog box for the procedure, run the
it's a versatile and responsive program designed to undertake a range of statistical procedures
procedure and look at the results
windows in spss - there are four main windows in spss and it would be useful to introduce
you to what the four windows in spss are and what each is used for
first one, data view - the data view is used to store and show your data
it is much like an ordinary spreadsheet although in general, the data is structured so that
rows are cases and the columns are for the different variables that relate to each case
second one, variable view - the variable view contains the variables on your data set so
it defines the properties of your data set
each row will define all of the various variables for one set of data
for example, for a numerical piece of data this would show amongst other things the number
spss is a windows based program that can be used to perform data entry and analysis and
of decimal places that are stored for that piece of data
measure
ensuring that the measure of your variables is correct is vital
the variable can be nominal which is for strings of data, ordinal for data that is in continuous
but can be ranked or ordered or finally scale which is used for a variable that is continuous
for example, a distance to somewhere
third one, output viewer window - this window is used to show the results that have been
output from your data analysis
depending on your analysis that are carrying out this may include the chart editor window
to create tables and graphs
or pivot table window
fourth one, syntax editor window - this window shows the underlying commands that have executed
your data analysis
if you are a confident coder this is where you can amend the code or write your own from
scratch and then run your own custom analysis of your data set
getting started - spss mainly uses two windows, the data editor, this is where you input your
data and carry out statistical functions and the viewer, this is where the result of any
analysis appear
there are several additional windows that can be activated such as the syntax editor,
which allows you to end a spss commands manually, rather than using the window based menus
spss capable of handling large amounts of data and can perform all of the analysis covered
for beginners, the syntax window is redundant because you can carry out most analysis by
clicking merrily with your mouse
however, there are additional functions that can be accessed using syntax and this can
often save you time
this startup of window of spss is given in the figure
once spss has been activated, a startup window will appear which allows you to select various options
if you already have a data file on disk that you would like to open then select open an
existing data source
the data editor - the main spss window includes the data editor for entering data
this window is where most of the action happens
here and much more
at the top of the screen is a menu bar similar to the ones you might have seen in other programs
following shows this menu bar and the data editor
there are several menus at the top of the screen that can be activated by using the
computer mouse to move the on screen arrow on to the desired menu and then pressing the
left mouse button once
when you have clicked on a menu, a menu box will appear that displays a list of options
that can be activated by moving the onscreen arrow so that it is pointing at the desired
option and then clicking with the mouse
often, selecting an option from a menu makes a window appear
these windows are referred to as dialog boxes
spss is commonly used in the social sciences and in the business world
the data editor has two views, the data view and the variable view
the data view is for entering data and the variable view is for defining characteristics
of the variables within the data editor
notice at the bottom of the data editor that there are two tabs labeled data view and variable
view, all we do to switch between these two views is to click on these tabs the highlighted
tabs, tell you which view you are in although, it will be obvious
let's look at some general features of the data editor features that don't change when
we switch between the data view, and the variable view
entering data into the data editor - when you first load spss, it will provide a blank
data editor with the title, untitled one, when you input, a new set of data, you must
so, familiarity with this program should serve you well in the future
input your data in a logical way, the spss data editor is arranged, such that each row
represents the data from one entity, while each column represents a variable
there is no discrimination between independent and dependent variables
both types should be placed in a separate column
the key point is that each row represents one entities data
therefore, any information about that case should be entered across the data editor
for example, imagine you were interested in six differences in perceptions of pain created
by hot and cold stimuli
you could place some people's hands in a bucket of very cold water for a minute and asked
them to rate how painful they thought the experience was on a scale of one to ten
spss is updated often, spss is software for editing and analyzing all sorts of data
welcome to the session on mathematica
for example, to change the default values of fonts, you would choose formatting options
slash fonts after selecting preferences other useful editing commands are available in the
input menu copy input from above and copy output from above
the mathematica kernel - it is helpful to understand that the mathematica program consists
of two parts, the user interface and the kernel the user interface simplifies the process
of entering mathematical equations and translates the output into easier to read symbols, the
kernel is the part of mathematica that performs computations when you start a mathematica
session only the user interface is running, the kernel will be launched the first time
you ask mathematica to evaluate an input cell consequently it usually takes mathematica
sometime to complete the first evaluation, since the kernel must be started before the
practical tool for large scale numerical calculations
evaluation can occur
after the kernel is launched all further cell evaluations will be faster, since the kernel
is already started the kernel remembers each evaluation it has performed and the order
in which these were performed this ordering is indicated by the sequential numbering that
mathematica assigns to each evaluated input and the resulting output, this ordering can
be important if you have used the same variable names to designate different calculations
occasionally you may have performed an evaluation earlier that is interfering with a subsequent
evaluation, when this happens it is sometimes helpful to use the quit kernel command from
the kernel menu and to restart the evaluation process you can then either use the start
kernel command also on the kernel menu or just select a cell to evaluate and then type
its applications can range from simple calculations to complicated programs and mathematica can
shift and enter, which will launch the kernel, when you have quit kernel and then started
again you will need to evaluate cells as if they have not been previously evaluated
plotting - the basic command to plot functions is plot of f of x comma within the brackets
x, a, b where a, b is the range of values you want to display on the x axis mathematica
will plot symbolic functions for this reason mathematica can be used to quickly provide
information on the shape of a function, this is very useful for quickly viewing whether
the equation you derived in your homework solution is reasonable it is often convenient
to name plots example, p equal to plot of f of x x, a, b gives this plot the name p
one, then later you can use the show command example show p one, p two, p three etcetera
where plots p two and p three have been defined by similar commands to show several plots
be a powerful tool for quantitative geoscientists such as geologists, geographers, geophysicists,
on the same axis
also this allows the user to redefine plotting options example, the axis length, titles etcetera
without retyping the plot command, several options can be used with plot or show are
is false axeslabel with x axis label, y axis label, labels the axis of a plot, the default
is no axes labels framelabels to bottom x axis label, left y axis label, top label,
right secondary y axis label, labels the frame of a plot, the default is no frame labels
the last two can just be left out if they are not needed plotlabel to name places a
name above the plot, the default is no plot title plotrange to y minimum, y maximum changes
the range of y axis plotstyle to curve one style, curve two style etcetera changes the
hydrologists and oceanographers because it’s a general mathematics system rather than a
line styles of curves
an example is plotstyle to thickness of zero point zero two, graylevel point zero five,
dashing point zero five for a thick gray, dashed line this command needs to be used
with the plot command equations - to define an equation use two equal signs that is left
hand side double equal to right hand side, equations are not functions, they are equations
you must be interested in solving, that is finding the values of one or more of the variables
to satisfy the equality
analytical solutions or symbolic function generated - the command solve will find exact
solutions to linear systems of equations the command is solve equation one of x, y double
equal to equation two of x, y comma equation three x, y double equal to equation four of
task specific application, however its utility may not be apparent at first glance it does
x, y comma x, y where the equations are functions of x and y notice that the brackets are needed
around the equations to be solved because there are more than one
numerical solutions number value generated the main commands to solve equations numerically
are nroots of polynomial one x double equal to polynomial one of x comma x will find the
roots of a polynomial, even if there are more than one root findroot of equation x comma
x initial guess will work for all equations written in the form that equation of x equals
zero note that the zero is not included in the command provided that the initial guess
is good enough, good enough means that findroot works not good enough means that findroot
does not work and you must try to make a better initial guess
in choosing an initial guess it is often useful to examine a plot of the function when only
not after all solve specific geo scientific problems any more than do programming language
one initial guess is given findroot uses newton's method, if you give a low and high range to
the initial guess that is findroot of equation x comma x log <?></?>* findroot will use the
second method instead of newton’s method usually the second method is more stable than
newton's method that is the second method may be less sensitive to poor initial guesses
programming in mathematica - a program or code is a sequence of instructions to solve
some problem, in mathematica we input each instruction and press the return key, after
all instructions are typed in we press the enter key to execute the sequence individual
instructions in the code can be assignment statements, iteration statements or loops
conditional like if, input or output statements, functions or other programming constricts
looping constructs or iteration - allow repeated evaluation of expressions, functions do, for
such as c or fortran or spreadsheet programs
and while are similar to looping statements in high level programming languages do function
has general forms do body within brackets k, kstart, kstop, dk evaluates body repeatedly
values are one
for function - has the general form for initial, test, increment, body first the initial statements
are processed then the test condition is evaluated if test is true the body is processed, then
increment is processed, the sequence test, body, increment is repeatedly processed until
test is false while function - has the general form- while test, body where body is a set
of statements that are repeatedly processed until test is evaluated to be false
conditionals or decision statements - high level programming languages generally make
over the years we have encountered many geo scientists who know that mathematica exists
decisions as to which processing steps should be executed next using an if structure but
some languages provide other conditionals as well mathematica provide the functions
if, which and switch for decision making if function - if test, true statements, false
statements, if the test is true the true statements are executed, if the test is false the false
statements are executed
which function? which test one, value one, test two, value two, etcetera returns the
first value k associated with the first true test k as tester evaluated left to right
switch function - switch expression, form one, value one, form two, value two etcetera,
default evaluates expression and compares it to each form k in left to right order and
returns the corresponding value k when a match is found the underscore above is an optional
but are not sure what it does with regard to the specific problems they face in their
default form matches anything
functional programming - functional programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building
the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation
of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data it is a declarative
programming paradigm which means programming is done with expressions in functional code
the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are input to the function
so, calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x will produce the same
result f of x each time
eliminating side effects that is changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs
can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program which is
research or professional practice, the short answer is that it does nothing geo scientific
mathematica is a symbolic mathematical computation program
one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming treats computation
as the evaluation of mathematical functions avoids changing state - output value of a
function depends only on the arguments eliminating side effects can make it much easier to predict
the behavior of a program
in this module mathematica computing system and its characteristics are discussed in detail,
this module gives an account of the basic syntax of mathematica and the basic rules
for its syntax the fundamental concepts mathematica kernel is discussed followed by plotting and
equation techniques, we also discussed various programming constricts used in the system
and briefly introduced the concept of functional programming in mathematica hope you enjoy
this session, see you next time, until then, bye
in particular but has the potential to do just about anything that a user can imagine
computational geosciences with mathematica is intended to help fill that gap by illustrating
how mathematica can be used to formulate, solve and visualize a variety of problems
of interest to geoscientists the functionality of mathematica which includes many standard
packages with specialized functions in areas such as statistics and graphics can be expanded
with packages available through wolfram research other commercial sources or the public domain
packages that may be of interest to geoscientists but which are not covered here include a database
access kit, digital image processing, experimental data analysis, real-time three d graphics, facility,
neural networks, signal processing, time series analysis and wavelets those who are interested
in those packages can contact wolfram research for more information about their capabilities
sometimes called a computer algebra program used in many scientific engineering, mathematical
and availability
basic syntax - symbols plus, minus, hyphen, exponential, star are all supported by mathematica
multiplication can be represented by a space between variables a x plus b and a star x
plus b are identical on the other hand ax plus b without a space between a and x denotes
the sum of two variables, one named ax and the other b
warning mathematica is case sensitive, for example the command to exit is quit and not
quit or capital quit square brackets are used around function arguments write sin
of within square brackets x not sin within simple brackets x or sin within curly braces x
parenthesis or simple brackets group terms for math operations, as in within brackets
psi of x plus cos of y star tan of z plus z exponent two
and computing fields it was conceived by stephen wolfram and is developed by wolfram
if you end an expression with a semicolon it will be executed but its output will not
be shown this is useful for simulations braces are used for list, that is a can have the
form within curly braces eighty one, two, three which outputs within the set eighty
one, two, three names can refer to variables, expressions, functions, matrices, graphs etcetera
a name is assigned using name equal to object
an expression may contain undefined names for example, a equal to within brackets a
plus b exponent three, the output will be a plus b whole cube and a exponent two will
be a plus b whole raised to six the percent sign or percentage symbol reproduces the value
of the previous results for example, five plus three the output will be eight and percentage
exponent two will give eight to the power two which is sixty four
research of champagne, illinois
basic rules of mathematica syntax - the arguments of functions are given in brackets parenthesis
are used for grouping operations; vectors, matrices and lists are given in braces and
double square brackets are used for indexing list and tables mathematica is case sensitive
thus, cos of x is not the same as capital cos of x and be careful mathematica has several
built-in functions example cos of x, sin of x, exponent of x etcetera
the first letter of built-in functions always have the first letter capitalized and if a
name consists of two or more words the first letter of each word is capitalized and there
will be no spaces between the words for example, laplace transform of x, the palette basic
input dot nb contains symbols for common mathematical manipulations like integration, differentiation,
summation, division and exponentiation
the wolfram language is the programming language used in mathematica hence it is a system
greek symbols are also included in this notebook, the basic input dot nb palette is usually
open when mathematica is started however it is sometimes hidden behind the open notebook,
if it is open and hidden it can be found through the window menu the top of the window menu
lists commands for organizing the window, the bottom of the window menu lists all windows
that are currently active, you may see untitled one dot nb messages in addition to basic input
dot nb if basic input dot nb appears select it and the palette should appear, if it is
not listed then it can be opened from the palettes command in the file menu
note that there are other palettes available in addition to basic input dot nb that you
may find useful as well the mathematical and greek symbols in basicinput dot nb can
be selected by clicking on the chosen symbol and then selecting each of the empty boxes
of computer programs for performing mathematical operations such as symbolic manipulation,
and filling them in similar to the procedures used in equation editor of a word processor
mathematica understands the greek letter pi to be pi that is three point one four one
five, etcetera mathematical manipulations can also be input through a set of standardized
notation, multiplication is represented by either a space or star
in mathematica a space b means a star b but ab means you have a new variable with the
name ab powers are denoted by a exponent or by using the symbolic representation in
basic input dot nb, remember that mathematica is case sensitive, a variable named ab is
not same as variable named small letters ab, if you get no response example, mathematica
seems to be in an infinite loop or an incorrect response you may have entered or executed
the command incorrectly, you can stop execution of a command by clicking interrupt evaluation
numerical calculations, graphics and programming mathematica is sometimes described as a computer
under the kernel menu
if you want the output from an evaluated function to be displayed as a numerical value example,
in decimal format rather than as a symbol or fraction, use the command n and the brackets
for example, n of pi will return three point one four one five nine and n of pi comma twenty
five will return the number pi to twenty five digits typing double slash n after the input
line will achieve the same results example, pi double slash n returns three point one
four one five nine if you wish to perform an operation on the last output that mathematica
produced you can use the symbol percentage for example, n of percentage will result in
the decimal representation of the last output, for example, input and then evaluate pi, mathematica
will respond with p
algebra system probably in difference to the strong symbolic but somewhat limited numerical
now, type n of percentage, mathematica will respond with three point one four one five
you can also refer to specific output using output number here or percentage output number
where output number is the number mathematica has assigned to the cell when it was evaluated
for example, to generate the numerical value of the output designated as out of seventeen
the command is n of percentage seventeen or n of out of seventeen keep in mind that a
specific output number will change if you re-evaluate an input line
to delete a cell select the right bracket designated the cell and select the clear command
from the edit menu, other useful editing commands can be found in the edit menu, including cut,
copy, copy as and paste notice that the preferences command appears in the edit menu, you can
use the preferences command to set default preferences for various mathematica operations
capabilities of its earliest versions, but it has evolved into system that is now a very
music
the pluralism is very important for the
credibility of the commission for instance, their society
comprises of a number of sections and the commission
should represent this wide class section of the society
and in order to enable marginalized sections, vulnerable sections
and everyone to approach it freely for redress
whenever there are serious to human rights violations,
quite often, it could be the case that
it could be predominantly a male body
with no sufficient representation for women members
and promotion of human rights
it could also be the case that the representation in the is level
would not be doing enough justice to the
religious, linguistic, ethnic minorities or persons with
disabilities or a persons from other vulnerable sections of the population
it's very important to ensure
that this body maintains
pluralism and it is a representative of the society
and so that there is a high level of credibility
let's come to the fifth principle
nhrc's should have adequate resources
at a third level, we have
as i said earlier on the commission's have a range of
functions which includes complaint redressal, which
includes promotional functions, in order to carry out all these
activities, it should have wide resources
by nature, these nhrc's are
like watchdogs and they check our set limits on the state action
whenever it is encroaches on the individuals liberties
while performing these functions, it is entirely
possible that it could trade on the government's stores
and the government of the day,
institutions which are known as national human rights institutions
which is not happy with this fault finding
or naming by the human rights commission could
adversely reduce its budget there have been many examples in
the contemporary history where a nhrc has taken an independent
stand, asserted independence is only to find that its manpower
has been suddenly reduced drastically, or its budget has
been slashed disproportionately within the asian context there
have been, i do not wish to name the countries, but that's why
it's extremely important to
mention in the found
whose mandate is mentioned in a either statute or
in a constitution of a country
and there are different types
in fact, in some countries, they can only do research and
have a promotional role as in germany and france,
on some other european countries in some other countries, there are equal
opportunities commission's which can look at employment equity
dear students, welcome to mooc on human rights in india
like in canada or hong kong there are some nhri's, which
have a wider mandate, which can look at the entire gamut of
civil political as well as economic social, cultural rights
in fact, these range of functions which a nhri performs,
can be categorized under too broad it's protection
and promotion
by protection the body receives complaints
and then takes up those complaints with the view
to redress them and which is a and then in addition, it does
monitoring and a number of other functions, which come under the
we are going to consider in this module paris principles
category of protection
there is a promotion aspect,
which is done through spreading, human rights literacy, awareness,
conducting seminars, conferences, sensitization programs
and using such tools to promote human rights
so, in fact, one has to work on both these legs, that off protection
as well as promotion
in fact, keeping in view, a wide range of nhris
that are available across the world
a conference was convened by the un human rights commission
first, let us see, what are nhri? what are paris principles?
in the year one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one at paris, to discuss the standards that are
required for nhri
and that's how paris principles were
adopted by the un human rights commission
and subsequently in the year one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three
the un general assembly also adopted these paris principles
in fact, they are so cirtical
to the functioning of a national human rights commission
in fact, it matters a lot for their accreditation
the extent of complaints of a nhri
and how are these principles relevant to the work of nhri's
with the paris principles will determine
whether it has a "a" status or a "b" or a "c" status,
which in turn will influence its access to the
human rights council and its mechanisms
so let us see
these principles in greater detail
in fact, these paris principles are basically six in member
they cover and there are the require
that nhri's have a broad mandate and also they enjoy autonomy,
independence, pluralism, and that nhri should be
as you know, at one level we have
vested with adequate resources and adequate investigative powers
let us take up each of the six principles
for a in-depth examination first broad mandate
as i said earlier on, there are some commission's which have a
restricted role
they can look at some aspects of human rights
but not all
the paris principles require that
the nhri should have a wide mandate to look at the entire
gamut of civil political, as well as economic, social cultural rights,
charter based bodies, treaty based bodies
and that it should be explicitly mentioned in its founding statute
it's very important to not to restrict the
definition of human rights or not to restrict the
scope or the purview of a nhri and that's why it's very important to
ensure that it has a wide mandate or a broad mandate
second, let us take up autonomy: autonomy is very
important for nhri the autonomy has several dimensions
it includes operational autonomy, it includes financial autonomy,
and the nhri should have this autonomy in order to
be an effective your body because the human rights have been defined
at the united nations and another level you have
and it has a task to protect and promote human rights
and in order to discharge this mandate effectively,
it requires a full functional and operational autonomy
a third way it requires a independence
for example, a nhri's should have
the ability to make its own rules and how it should function
it should not be the case that for a every decision that it has
to take, it has to take an approval from a another
government department and so, in a way hands of from
the government and it is not dependent on the whims and
regional mechanisms in europe, america, africa and also asean,
fancies of any other power and it is able to exercise its independence
and the way it's a chairperson, members or
commissioners are appointed should also be such that they
cannot be removed easily or the conditions of service cannot be
the salary or other conditions cannot be changed during the
term to the disadvantage and there are many other such
provisions, which seek to ensure that the nhri's which are
fully compliant with the paris principles, enjoy a wide autonomy
as well as independence
let's now turn to the fourth principle of pluralism
where there are institutions at the regional level for protection
dear students, welcome to the mooc on human rights in india
in addition there are many other schemes which try to
guarantee some facet or other of human rights,
like lpg subsidy, which is a direct benefit transfer scheme,
a launched by the government a seeks to
it just the affluent sections to give up their lpg subsidy,
so that targeted intervention can be made for the
vulnerable sections
the executive also has a role to play in terms of
india's commitments under the international human rights conventions
india has signed or ratified
and the national human rights institution
many core human rights treaties
they include the treaty dealing with racial discrimination
they civil and political rights covenant,
economic social cultural rights covenant,
the convention dealing with all
forms of discrimination against women, convention dealing with
rights of the child and convention dealing with the
rights of persons with disabilities
each of these, in fact, in some countries, the legislature place a role
in the ratification of international human rights conventions
in fact, as you know, good governance is intrinsically
in india executive has a an important role to play
in the part of ratification decisions involving
international human rights conventions
quite often it involves harmonization of existing domestic legislation,
as per the standards laid down in the multilateral human rights conventions
recently,
india, about some a decade back india sign
the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities
it also signed the two optional protocols
to the convention on the rights of the child
related to human rights
one dealing with children armed conflict,
the other dealing with sale of children, child prostitution etc
this is at one level and under these human rights treaties,
there is a compulsory requirement of state party reporting
in fact, the state is supposed to have a broad based consultation
with various stakeholders and in preparing a report
for the treaty monitoring body and in fact,
from time to time, as mentioned in those treaties,
the executive prepares
periodic reports to the committee on the rights of the child,
in fact, the mahbub ul haq the famous economist
economic, social, cultural rights committee, the human rights committee,
and the cerd committee and so on so for and
thereafter, the senior government officials who across
to geneva or new york appeared before the treaty body,
which is consists of some independent persons answered their queries
and at the end of the day, when the treaty body
give some concluding observations and recommendations,
and these are again, implemented at the ground level by the executive
the follow up action is initiated by the executive,
and it is monitored by the executive
came up with a new term called humane governance,
when the commission on human rights at the international level
was replaced by the human rights council in the year two thousand and six
there was a new mechanism called universal periodic review
that was adopted by the un general assembly
under the universal periodic review, there is a twenty page,
state party report in page report compiled by united nations
of all the special procedures, mandate holders and ten page report from
other stakeholders, including national human rights institutions
and non governmental organization
here again, this process, which happens once in four years or so,
which is again very critical to the task of protection
it covers all countries of the world
and the countries have to have a broad based consultations
on the challenges on the achievements
and factors impeding the achievements of human rights,
and these are submitted in a state party report and here again,
there is a peer review process by the forty-seven countries
which are part of the human rights council at the end of it,
there again, some recommendations have made for taking follow up action
by the executive
to sum up or in conclusion,
and promotion of human rights
the executive has a critical role in the task of protection and
promotion of human rights and it
does it in a number of ways,
including implementation of legislation, enforcement of legislations
and also formulation of policies,
programs, schemes, monitoring, and also in translating
international human rights standards into reality
at the ground level
thank you
and the executive has a important role
in ensuring good governance and humane governments
how does it do this task ?
under the swyam platform today, we will take up the module
for instance, we have already seen in the last module,
how the in detail the role of legislature
legislature, one of the main task is to
pass legislation from time to time, and it is the
role of the executive to implement the legislations
that have been enacted by the parliament
and also see that various legislative provisions are
enforced at the ground level
if you see the constitution of india, the part five deals with
the executive with the center
dealing with role of executive in the task of protection and
and part six deals with the executive in states and
details are all mentioned there in the constitution and their powers
etc , or enshrined there
for instance, there is a union cabinet
which advises the president and all executive action
is done in the name of the president of india
and cabinet consists of senior ministers and there is a
collective responsibility and in addition to
implementation of legislations and enforcement of legislations,
the executive also has a critical role in the formulation of
promotion of human rights
policies, programs, schemes, from time to time,
in order to realize various constitutional goals,
various constitutional ideals
and the directive principles of state policy and the agenda of the
government of the day
for instance, this task also covers
policy, monitoring, policy review, policy corrections
you look at the executive at the center
there are a number of ministries, which have been established
for instance, you have a ministry of home affairs,
we have earlier considered the role
ministry of women and child development
and ministry of minority affairs,
ministry dealing with disability, labour,
health and family welfare, human resource development,
social justice and empowerment, tribal affairs
and these are just examples of a few ministries
as you can see by the names of these ministries
they have a critical role in translating
the constitutional ideals, constitutional goals
or the international treaty commitments to which india is a party
of judiciary and the role of legislature in detail, as you have seen
and earlier on india was following the five year plans
but these five year plans were recently abandoned,
and the niti aayog came into existence and
let me give you few examples of the schemes which are
directly relevant to the task of protection
and promotion of human rights
for instance, you all are aware of the
article twenty-one dealing with right to life
and how it has been,
interpreted in a very expansive manner by the supreme court of india
the national human rights protection system
and how many other rights were read into this article twenty-one
take for instance swachh bharat which aims at cleanliness
as you know, sanitation is one of the social determinants of right to health
and if you ensure sanitation, you can prevent diseases
swachh bharat is a program launch and there is a
it's like a movement, it's like a like a to create a
consciousness among the citizens
let me give a few more examples
for instance, there is a ayushman bharat scheme
right to health is an important right and in the ayushman bharat scheme
in that system, the executive is an important cornerstone in the
tries to reach out to a large number of people in india
and ensuring that they enjoy the right to health
what about safe drinking water ?
which is again an important human rights
there is a scheme dealing with bhagirathi
which aims at providing safe drinking water
the prime minister's awas yojana seeks to cover
the right to housing
for instance, there is a beti bachao beti padhao scheme
which seeks to ensure that female infanticide,
overall national human rights protection system
female feticide is address and in addition, the right to education
of the girl children is clearly protected
right to food as an important economic, social cultural right
for instance,
the mid-day meal scheme is a an important tool which is in the
hands of the executive to ensure that right to food of all is
secured particularly the children at the vulnerable sections
is secured
to you take for instance prime minister's jan-dhan yojana
which aims set financial inclusion and
besides legislature, judiciary, civil society
music
which sought to protect the right to food of its citizens
the same way
right to work is again, an important economic, social, cultural right
and the government adopted national rural employment guarantee act,
which sought to provide hundred days of employment
to a person under certain conditions
right to information is regarded as a an important right,
which enables a person to realize many other rights
and right to information act was adopted,
enacted in the year two thousand and five and it has been able to
with each of them having an important or significant role in the task of
bring about a paradigm shift from an regime governed under the
official secrets act to a regime which is marked by
transparency and citizen can by paying a partially some of rupees ten
can seek a information which is of atmost critical importance to him
parliament has also enacted a legislations dealing with the
protection of whistleblowers and also a number of other important aspects
this is one end, in addition to the passing the legislation,
there are a number of instruments that are open
to members of parliament to advance human rights
they use techniques such as question hour,
protection and promotion of human rights
zero hour, call attention motion, cut motion,
parliamentary debates, to advance human rights for instance
parliamentary questions are of two types
there is a starred question and unstarred question
the national human rights commission has noted that
since the adoption of protection of human rights act,
the number of questions relating to human rights questions
has really gone up in the parliament and
the starred questions are often accompanied by a supplementary
question by the person concerned
members of parliament represent the bill of the people
so, in addition to these parliamentary questions, there is a zero hour
which follows immediately after the question hour
so, in the zero hour, the members of parliament
again have
have a opportunity to draw attention of the executive
to draw attention of the house
to critical burning issues relating to human rights
so, parliament is a supreme body and it approves the budget
it approves, how each rupee shall
be spent by the executive
they in a way,
and in this process there are demands for grants
there are deep discussions on the budget
and the budgets reflects the prioritization
across competing demands
on the one hand, you have socio economic programmes
on the other hand, you have other programmes
so, how money shall be apportioned between different competing demands
is considered by the parliament and approved by the parliament
and often members of parliament move cut motions
or make changes in the way these some sort of portion
or trustees of the people's aspirations, the legislature
and some of them are under pinned by the considerations of human rights
in addition to budgets, there is something called
call attention motion
members of parliament can move a motions for a call attention
whenever there are some serious issues like starvation deaths
or other burning human rights issues
or other issues concerning nation or concerned and they seek
answers from the executive
</ep so, while we have some limited sessions
throughout the year of a few weeks each like a budget session,
is also a guardian of human rights
winter session, monsoon session in between these sessions
there are parliamentary committees,
which can transact a lot of work in a very silent manner
for example, there are committees are of two types,
there are parliamentary consultative committees
attached to different ministries
there are you have standing committees
which are of a permanent nature under ad hoc committees
for instance there is a standing committee
on the welfare of schedule caste
we will see what exactly is its role
there's a standing committee on the welfare of other backward classes
standing committee on women and these committees
a standing committee on labour,
standing committee on food and public distribution system
and these committees are basically elected or appointed by the
speaker or the house concerned
and during these committees proceedings,
a lot of important legislative work is transacted
parliament also has a very important role in acting as a
check on the executive
in the task of protection and promotion of human rights
for instance, there are parliamentary committees
of a special type like committee on estimates,
committee on subordinate legislation,
public accounts committee, committee on public undertakings
committee on various governance
government assurances for instance sometimes members of
parliament ask questions in the question hour and when the
government of the day give spot information and then promises to
share the information at a subsequent stage
that becomes an assurance to the parliament
and we will also see how members of parliament advance
and which is tracked and which is, for instance,
tracked by the committee on government assurances
and these special committees act
as a check on the expenditure of the government
or on the policies of the government and thus
hold the entire system accountable
now to conclude,
parliament has a critical role to play in the task of
protection and promotion of human rights
members of parliament in a way act as the guardian of human rights
this task of protection and promotion of human rights
dear students,
they pass legislations they use a variety of means,
including a question hour, zero hour, call attention motion,
cut motion and other private member's bill
and they also use parliamentary committees,
standing committees, ad hoc committees to advance
the task of protection of human rights, promotion of human rights
and they also serve as a check on the executive
and hold the executive accountable
thank you
as you know,
legislature, it's main role is passing legislations
and if you look at the legislations, there are two kinds
on the one hand you have a constitutional amendment acts
on the other hand, you have the regular legislation
let us take up the constitution of india
which is the supreme law of the country
it has undergone more than one hundred amendments
in the past seventeen years or so
in fact, let me tell you there in
welcome the mooc on human rights in india
among all these hundred odd amendments,
there are some amendments, which have a great significance
for the protection and promotion of human rights of the people
for instance, you take up seventy-three rd and seventy-four th constitutional amendments
that were adopted by the parliament
they sought to provide thirty-three percent reservation for women
in the gram panchayats and in the municipalities,
which are basically the units of local self government
it's a very for reaching move, considering that even in the
parliament at the national level, the proportion of woman
today we take up the role of legislature, in the task of
has never crossed beyond twelve percent so far
and if you look at eighty-six th constitutional amendment act,
it sought to provide a right to
free and compulsory education for those children
between the age of six and fourteen years recently, the parliament adopted
one hundred and three rd constitutional amendment act, which sought to provide
ten percent reservation for persons belonging to economically weaker sections
in educational institutions
when you look at the regular legislations,
there have been a plethora of legislations that are
protection and promotion of human rights
adopted by the parliament
for instance, in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three the parliament adopted
the protection of human rights act, which provided for the constitution of
national human rights commission and state human rights commission's
at the states and also human rights codes
and if you look at the preamble of the protection of human rights act,
these bodies were constituted quote unquote
for better protection of human rights
the parliament has also enacted special legislations
for the creation of national commission for women
you already seen in the first module,
national commission for minorities and
national commission for children and many other bodies
let's take a look at the legislations that were adopted for women
in fact, historically, women did not enjoy a high social,
economic or political status, though they constitute nearly half the sky
in fact, parliament in its wisdom, the lawmakers in their
zeal enacted a number of legislations
which sought to protect the rights of women,
including the ones dealing with abolishing of sati
abolishing of dowry,
the national human rights protection system
in decent representation,
prevention of immoral trafficking
and many
other like legislation, including the prevention of domestic violence, etc
you take children, children are vulnerable
they are the future of any country
and because of their vulnerability, because of their tender age,
their label for exploitation, the parliament has adopted
a number of impressive legislations dealing with like
prohibition of child marriages, prohibition of child labour
which consists of
and pre-conception pre-natal diagnostics act
and a number of other legislations, which seek to guarantee or protect
the rights of children
in so far as persons belonging to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes,
which are again vulnerable section of the population,
there is on the one hand protection of civil rights act
and then there is a prevention of atrocities
against scheduled castes and scheduled tribes act
and the parliament also enacted legislation, which sought to
eliminate manual scavenging and construction of dry latrines or even
with the nhri, at the core and legislature, executive,
eliminate the scourge of bonded labour
recently, the government also a number of years back adopted
the scheduled tribes and other traditional forest dwellers
and the protection of rights act
in addition to these categories, the parliament also enacted
legislation for the protection of the
rights of persons with disabilities in the year one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five
which was amended recently in two thousand and sixteen
like right to food is an important economic, social, cultural right
and the government in two thousand and six came out with the national food security act,
judiciary and civil society at four different corners
shall be deemed members of the national human rights commission
for carrying out functions which are specified in section twelve (b) to (j)
of the protection of human rights act we will see shortly
what is this section twelve section twelve basically defines the
functions of the national human rights commission
and according to section thirty-three of the act,
the deemed members shall have
a role in all functions of the nhrc except the one dealing with
handling individual complaints of human rights violations
and as for as the individual complaints of
first, the historical context:
human rights violations are concerned
the six main members
music
or the main commission, shall alone have the competence to
handle these complaints
let us see the section four of
the protection of human rights act, which talks
about the appointment of a chairperson
in fact, the chairperson and members are appointed
by a high level body of six members,
music
headed by the prime minister of india, and the
composition of this high level committee includes
music
the speaker of the lok sabha,
the deputy chairperson of the rajya sabha,
and also leaders of opposition from both the houses and also
the home minister
so in a way the composition is
music
is a very high level one and the presence of the leaders of opposition
the unesco first mooted the idea of a national commission
music
in this committee is a kind of an assurance that only
people with high integrity, high credibility gets selected for
appointment as chairperson and members
section six of the protection of human rights act
talks about the tenure of the chairperson and members,
according to it, the chairperson shall have a tenure of three years
or he can go up to the age of seventy years
and the chairperson is also eligible
for reappointment for a further term
for the protection and promotion of human rights,
on the other hand, the members are appointed for a term
of three years and they have no chance for getting reappointed
for this second term
in addition to the things that we
have seen earlier on the protection of human rights act
also specifies the manner of removal of chairperson and members
they could either resign or can be removed after a
proper inquiry for proven misbehaviour or incapacity
if you look at the following graphic, it clearly tells on the
various grounds for the removal of chairperson and members
but he did not catch much steam
these are more or less on the lines of a similar provisions for
the removal of judges of the supreme court of india
music
section twelve of the protection of human rights act gives the functions
of the commission
in fact, there are many ac functions of the commission
starting with individual complaints
music
in fact the commission has the power to
take up complaints about human rights violations
in seventy s this idea was again revived, but eventually,
these complaints can be of
music
of two kinds, one acts of commission,
or omission by a public servant
and it can be either brought by petition from the affected individual
or sua moto cognitions based on newspaper reports
or it can be triggered by referral from a court of law
the commission also has the power to intervene in a pending
proceeding in a court of law which involves substantive
dimensions of human rights
in the early ninety s, there was an international conference on the issue of
the commission can also visit jails
and other such institutions where persons are kept for
reformation or other purposes, and make recommendations for
better living conditions and protection of human rights in
these institutions
the commission can also review
music
the safeguards that are provided in constitution of india and other
laws that have been adopted by the parliament and such as
recommendations for better protection of human rights
national mechanisms for the protection and promotion of human rights
the commission can also undertake and promote research,
spread human rights literacy and awareness and promote the
activities of non governmental organizations
the commission has a statutory responsibility
to monitor international human rights conventions
and make recommendations there on section twelve
of the protection of human rights act also requires the commission
to study factors which impede the enjoyment of human rights,
say for instance, terrorism or poverty or any such factors
music
that was held in paris, which adopted the paris principles
in a some in the commission is supposed to work on multiple
legs on many walk on many legs, both protection as well as promotion
if you see the following graphic, it brings out very clearly
the various functions of the national human rights commission
in order to discharge these functions, the section thirteen of the act
stipulates that it will have the powers of a civil court,
it can summon people, ask for any documents, ask for witnesses
to depose before it and sections fo fourteen enables the nhrc
to utilize the services of any investigative agencies
that is in position
and subsequently, these were adopted by the un commission on
dear students, welcome to mooc on human rights in india
section seventeen of the act talks about the procedure
for dealing with inquiry into complaints
the moment a complaint comes the commission may
ask for a report
and if it is satisfied with the report of the
concern state government or the central government,
it may either accept it or if it's not satisfied,
it can conduct an inquiry and section eighteen of the
protection of human rights act, talks about steps after inquiry
the after finding a prima facie a violation of human rights
human rights and also by the un general assembly
the commission could either recommend the payment of
compensation to a victim
it can also recommend prosecution of the
guilty personnel who have committed the violation of human rights
or it can also make other orders
music
the commission also has the
power to approach the supreme court or high court
for issue of appropriate <?> ritged </?> orders
for enforcement of its recommendations
so this adoption of the paris principles gave a further plip
one interesting thing about the national human rights commission is that
it has the power to award in interim relief,
even pending the conclusion of a particular inquiry
if it is satisfied that the circumstances merit the
award of a interim relief to victim
section nineteen of the protection of human rights act
stipulates the procedure for dealing with complaints of
human rights violations committed by armed forces personnel
here, the commission can seek a report from
the relevant authority that is in the case central government
to the establishment of national human rights commission's
the ministry of defence and after receiving the report,
the commission can make its own finding
there is one important distinction between
human rights violations committed by
music
public servants in general, and the acts committed
by armed forces personnel with regard to the violations
committed by personnel of armed forces is separate procedure has
been mentioned in the protection of human rights act
the commission cannot investigate the violations committed by the
and if you look at the indian context,
personnel of armed forces and this issue has been critiqued by
many civil society groups
music
section twenty talks about submission of annual reports or
special reports by the national human rights commission
music
one interesting thing here is that the government is required
or mandated by the protection of human rights act,
to submit a memorandum of on the action taken on the
recommendations of the national human rights commission
there were international calls
in case it is not accepting any particular recommendation,
the government is required to spell out the reasons for
non acceptance of the recommendations and this document
is required to be laid on the table of the parliament
so this in a way so, accountability, it holds the
executive accountable for protection and promotion of human rights
section twenty-one deals with the state human rights commission's and these,
the state human rights commission's have more or less
the same functions as the national human rights commission
but the one important distinction is that look at the
for accountability for human rights violations in jammu and kashmir,
list two and list three in the seven th schedule of the constitution
which basically deal with the state list
and concurrent list the shrc have
mandate over these items which or mentioned in the state list
or in the concurrent list
the chairperson of the commission can be appointed by a
high level committee and he he can hold an office for a year or
three year term and is eligible for reappointment
and the chairperson has to be
former chief justice or a judge of a high court
in the northeast, in andhra pradesh, and not only
and it's a the state human rights commission's are supposed
to be a three member body with one chairperson and one member
who has been a judge of the high court and one member who has a
practical experience in the matters relating to human rights
section thirty of the protection human rights talk
talks about human rights court that it enables
state governments to specify
a sessions court in every district to try violations of
human rights in the human rights court
does the nhrc which has been established
international outcries, but also there were aspirations from the
under the protection of human rights act
one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three comply with the paris principles
we have seen in the earlier module of these paris principles,
how they talk about wide mandate, how to talk
about autonomy, independence, and also adequate powers of
investigation, pluralism, etc the national human rights
commission's mandate covers both civil, political as well as
economic, social, cultural rights
music
and in that sense it has a
civil society within india for establishment of a mechanism for
wide mandate in fact the manner of appointment of
chairperson and their service conditions, the manner of their
removal or such that they are required to maintain independence
exercise, both functional autonomy,
financial autonomy, the amount of money that is
spent by an nhrc is voted by the parliament through some grants
and there is a body of personnel under the investigation division,
which is answerable only to the national human rights commission
and the commission also, as we have earlier seen,
has six members of whom at least there shall be one woman member
better protection of human rights and that's how, in the
in this module, we take up the protection of human rights act one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three
and the by virtue of
the chairperson of the national commission for women,
minorities, sc's, st's, children and also
backward classes and also the chief commissioner for persons
with disability being made as deemed members of the nhrc
contributes towards the pluralism of the commission
and so in a way
these elements go on to strengthen the commission
but the civil society has its own reservation and wants it to be
more effective and robust body
month of september one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three an ordinance was passed by the
music
in the act was initially adopted in the year one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three
it was amended once in two thousand and six and again recently in two thousand and nineteen
and with a view to making this further compliant
with the paris principles with a view to making the body
pluralistic, with a view to making it more effective, and
the civil society of course is not fully happy or satisfied
with the amendments that have been enacted in the year two thousand and nineteen
on the whole
music
government of india,
here is a act which provides for the
constitution of a national commission at the center,
the state human rights commission's at the states
and also human rights courts and they have all been their
functions, their powers and then the procedures have all
been mentioned in the protection of human rights act
see you in the next module happy learning
music
establishing a national human rights commission,
with justice ranganath mishra, as the chair
subsequently, a legislation was introduced in the lok sabha as
it was passed and that's how the protection of human rights act one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three
was adopted by india
let us look at the various features of the
music
this act
in this module, we will look at three things
the preamble of this legislation captures the spirit
if you look at the preamble, there is a reference to the
establishment of a national human rights commission
at the union level, and also state human rights commission's
in various states and human rights courts for,
quote unquote better protection of human rights
so the
music
prior to this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three protection of human rights act,
the supreme court the high courts had been
the historical context in which
custodians of human rights had been
jealously guarding human rights, in need was felt for
establishment of a special mechanisms for better protection
of human rights
as captured in the preamble to this act
definition of human rights is an extremely important element,
which is given in the section two (d) section two (d) defines human rights as
right to life, right to liberty, right to equality
and right to dignity, which are guaranteed by the constitution
of india or embodied in the international covenants and
music
enforceable in indian courts section two of the protection of
human rights act further defines these international covenants as
the international covenants on civil and political rights one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six
the international covenant on economic social and cultural rights one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six
and such other conventions
music
which are adopted by the
un general assembly and which are specified by the
government of india in a gadget so, this is how the human rights
have been defined in the protection of human rights act
the protection of human rights act was
in both section two (d) read along with section two f of the
protection of human rights act chapter two of the protection of
human rights act talks about the national human rights commission
in particular if you see the section three ( 2), it talks
about the nhrc that it shall consists of
music
a chairperson,
music
two members from higher judiciary, and three members from people
who have expert knowledge and experience in matters relating
adopted and enacted secondly, we will also see the
to human rights
according to section three ( 2) there shall be a chairperson
who has been
music
the chief justice or a judge of a supreme court of india
and one member shall be judge of the supreme court
and one member shall be a former chief justice of the high court,
and three members of whom at least one
shall be a woman from those who have special knowledge or
experience in matters relating to human rights
provisions of the human rights act
thus, there are
the commission shall consists of six members, three drawn from
the higher judiciary, and three from those who have special
knowledge and experience in human rights
in addition, section three ( 3) of the protection of human rights act
talks about seven deemed members
for instance, the chairpersons of the national commission for minorities,
national commission for women, scheduled castes, scheduled tribes,
backward classes, the commission for protection of child rights
and also the chief commissioner for persons with disabilities
and we will also see how they comply with the paris principles
one lakh cases every year the law division is headed by a registrar
who is supported by several presenting officers, one joint registrar
and many deputy registrar's and assistant registrar's,
very important and high profile cases are placed before the
full commission of six members chairperson and five members
and instances relating to custodial deaths and other
matters are often placed before division bench
and there are of course, single member benches are there
music
the commission also has
it was established on twelve october one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three
music
camp sittings at other places within india
and where it handles matters
music
in addition to the law division, we have
an investigation division in the national human rights commission
headed by the an officer of the rank of director general of police,
and this division
music
investigates complaints which are referred to it by the commission
under the protection of human rights act, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three
and it also monitors deaths in police custody,
deaths in judicial custody and
music
deaths in fake encounters or what are called extra judicial executions
the administrative division of the commission
handles all establishment matters, personnel, library,
publications, computers, and many other issues
the training division tries to sensitize
people within government or outside government about issues
relating to human rights
and which was subsequently amended in the year two thousand and six and also in two thousand and nineteen
the training division also organizers,
short term and long term internship programmes
music
the policy research program and projects division
music
looks at research on important aspects relating to human rights
and also monitoring the international human rights conventions
and making recommendations to the
government from time to time
the policy research division basically, whenever nhrc feels
what are the important characteristics or
that a particular matter is of such importance that it requires
sustained monitoring over the years that is converted into a
project, say for instance, trafficking in women and children,
quality assurance in mental health, or elimination of bonded labour
or child labour, or manual scavenging some of these matters
requires sustained,
continuous monitoring and these are converted into programs and
projects and entrusted to the policy research programs and
projects division
again recall, there are five divisions in the commission law,
features of the national human rights commission?
investigation, administration,
music
training and policy research division
so, these five assists the human rights commission
in the discharge of the various functions,
which are provided under section twelve of the
protection of human rights act i want to explain in some
detail, the complaint handling mechanism of the commission
anybody who is affected or a non governmental organization can bring
a matter to the attention of the commission
music
music
it should ideally be
violation of human rights committed by a public servant
or negligence in the prevention of a violation again by a public servant,
or the matter could be referred by a court of law to the nhrc
a person who wants to complain can do so in a number ways
he or she can file an online form
that has been provided for this purpose,
or send a self contained letter,
petition without the aid of any lawyer or the person can also
it is an
visit the commission and give the or send a mail to the commission
it's very important to understand what kind of
matters can be entertained by the commission and what cannot be
basically, the matter has to come under the ambit of the
protection of human rights, particularly the definition of
human rights that is mentioned in the section two of the
protection of human rights act and only acts of omission
or commission by public servants alone or the subject matter of the nhrc
in other words, acts of private agents cannot be
normally be brought under the commission
music
for instance,
music
an incidents which are more than one year old,
music
cannot be referred to the nhrc for redressal, there is a
section thirty-six of the protection of human rights act, under which
there is a time limitation, aa which is there, that these
complaints become time barred and thus become non entertainable
in addition, if the com if the complaint is already pending before
another commission, let's say a women's commission,
statutory body
children's commission or a scheduled cast commission,
or any other commission of inquiry duly constituted
or it is sub judice before a court of law
this matters are not normally entertainable by the nhrc
let me explain the steps after inquiry
a range of options are open to the commission
after inquiry into a complaint of human rights violation,
where there is a prima facie violation, the commission can recommend
award of monetary compensation it could even be interim compensation
pending the conclusion of the inquiry
having been established under the protection of human rights act
dear students,
the commission can also recommend prosecution of the guilty or errant
public servants involved in the that particular incidents
the commission can share its report to the complainant
and the commission can also publish its report of
the human rights violation and also the sworn order
so these are in addition to this, the commission can also approach
as a supreme court or a high court for issue of appropriate
directions and <?> rigged </?>
so, these are range of courses which are
range of options which are available to the nhrc after
in addition, it is a recommendatory body
inquiry into violation of human rights
under section nineteen of the protection human rights act
as a restricted procedure has been provided for
dealing with violations committed by armed forces personnel
let me take you through a list of illustrative cases
in the first case, we will look at what the commission did
in the case of deaths of civilians
music
in the bijbehara
it is the first case taken by the nhrc soon after its
in the sense that it cannot issue binding orders
establishment in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three
i this in this incident, there was an unprovoked
firing on unarmed civilians
by border security force personnel,
which led to the death of sixty civilians
and the commission took suo moto cognizance based on newspaper reports,
called for reports from the concerned
agencies and thereafter recommended action against the
errant bsf personnel under the bsf act, payment of compensation
to the next of kin of those who died
or <?> rigged </?> like the courts of law,
the nhrc also said
the deployment pattern of bsf personnel should be reviewed
particularly when they are asked to operate in civilian areas
music
let me take you to a get another case involving
chakma and hajong refugees in arunachal pradesh
these persons fled the then east pakistan
and settled in arunachal pradesh
in response to complaints from people's union for civil liberties,
amnesty international and others
music
the national human rights commission made a series of
recommendations to the government of arunachal pradesh
with the request to or with a to protect the right to life and
property of these refugees
when the commission
found that there was a unusually long delay or a protracted delay
on the part of the state government in implementing these
recommendations, the commission took up a petition to the
supreme court of india and the supreme court gave directions to
the concerned state government and others to ensure that the
where it finds prima facie violation
right to life and property of the chakma refugees is protected
gujarat riots happened in the year two thousand and two in which many
persons of muslim origin died, and there was a loss of home
state and other property
the commission took fact finding,
and based on that made
music
a series of recommendations to the government of gujarat
for rehabilitation of victims, and also for
music
or where it finds an important burning issue relating to human rights,
detailed investigation of each of these cases, when it found
that there was lack of action the commission was constrained
to take the matter to the supreme court of india and
thereafter in a number of cases, a positive action has happened
and the victims have got some relief, and the the courts also
have been able to prosecute a number of persons responsible
let me draw your attention to a right to food case
in the in orissa about some two decades back there was
in what are known as kbk districts basically, koraput,
bolangir and kalahandi districts, there was reports of
it can only make suitable recommendations to the
starvation deaths and the commission sent senior most persons for
music
on the spot investigation and thereafter, the commission
asked a special rapporteur to monitor the situation and in
the orissa starvation deaths case, the nhrc made a series of
short term and long term recommendations to the state
government and the central government particularly with
regard to the public distribution system, employment generation program,
irrigation programmes, agricultural programmes
and many other programmes and and the sustained monitoring by the commission
concerned authority for implementation
has led to some positive impact on the ground
in addition to these, there were matters relating to
music
punjab mass cremation,
was referred by supreme court to the nhrc for monitoring
and the commission also went into atrocities
committed by special task force personnel, constituted by
government of tamil nadu and government of karnataka to nab
the sandalwoods smuggler veerappan,
and particularly they tribals
music
became victims in the process
and the commission made a
a record a compensation after finding after fact finding on the ground after
and after ascertaining the facts
in addition, the commission has intervened in many many cases
involving child labour, bonded labour, violation of the
rights of women, children and other sections of people
in this module, we have seen the structure, composition role of
the nhrc and also it's important characteristics at some
important cases taken by nhrc
in addition,
welcome to mooc on the national human rights commission
thank you
see you in the next module
music
music
it is compliant with paris principles has a wide mandate
and it is also an independent body
and how is this independence ensured ?
music
the term of service of chairperson and members is fixed
music
for instance, it is a three years under the amended act in two thousand and nineteen
music
they cannot be removed
in the earlier module, we saw the protection of human rights act
music
at the whims and fancies of the government in power,
and the manner of their removal is laid down in the statuted
their salary cannot be reduced during their tenure
so all these features give independence to the
national human rights commission
it also has the powers of a civil court
while handling complaints of human rights violations
so all these features go on to make it
a strong, powerful body
and in this module, we'll take up the structure,
music
which is needed to address protection and promotion of
human rights issues in the country
let us now turn our attention to the composition of the commission,
as provided in the section three of the protection of human rights act
students, i wish to draw your attention to the
graphic in this regard, please follow the
graphic for the current composition of the
national human rights commission
as you can see from the table,
composition,
the commission is headed by a former chief justice of india,
justice h l dattu who is the chairperson and
there are currently in addition to chairperson,
three other members, shri justice prafulla chandra pant
is a member, smt jyotika kalra and dr dnyaneshwar manohar mulay
are the members
there are two vacancies currently in addition,
there are deemed members and as you can see from the table,
the chairperson of the national commission for minorities is
sc's, st's, women, child rights commission and
music
commission for backward classes
and the chief commissioner for persons with disabilities
or the ex-officio members or deemed members,
and they participate in the meetings of the statutory full commission
section three also provides that there shall be a
secretary general, who will be chief executive officer of the commission
the secretary general can exercise
all administrative, financial powers, subject of course to the
control of the chairperson of the national human rights commission
he can not have any role in judicial functions
role, important features of the national human rights commission,
or the power to draw regulations
which are only with the commission
if you look at the adm structure of the nhrc,
it is divided into five divisions
i draw your attention to the graphic, which
the five divisions of the commission or given there is a law division,
there is an investigation division and there is a
music
administrative division and training division and there is a
policy research programmes, projects division
and also how it carries out investigation or inquiry
let us take up law division,
music
law division handles
music
all matters right from the stage of
receipt of complaints of human rights violation,
processes them and then places them before the
commission for appropriate directions and follows up the
action taken
it normally receives around hundred thousands or
music
immediate interium relief to the victim or prosecution of the
errant or guilty police personnel
it took the matters to the court of law
for enforcement of these orders or published
these recommendations so these are the various steps
which are involved after the inquiry into a
human rights violation
let us turn our attention to the second major function,
which has been entrusted to the nhrc
that is namely intervention in a pending court proceeding
protection of human rights act one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three
for instance, if the commission
comes to the decision that here is a matter, which involves
substantive human rights issue, and where the commission can
seek the permission of the that particular court and with its
permission, intervene in that proceeding, are in order to
achieve a larger purpose
so, under this section twelve (b),
the commission has intervene in many cases
i'll give you a few examples
for instance, there was a case of a charanjit singh,
secondly, we will also see,
who was launched in delhi prison
and who was languishing in the prison
as an undertrial prisoner for about sixteen years,
and he was also mentally challenged as a result of his
mental health condition, his trial could not proceed
and whereas he continued to languish in the
prison to the commission notice this
and the commission special rapporteur during the prison visits
notice this issue
and brought this matter to the attention of the delhi high court
what did nhrc do under each of these
and asked for crashing of the trial and transfer of
charanjit singh to a mental institution
accordingly, the delhi high court accepted
the nhrc's requests and order the
quashing of the trial of charanjit singh and also his
transfer to mental health institution
and in the process, series of guidelines were also
adopted by the national human rights commission
and they were placed before the high court and which
the high court accepted for handling such cases
functions that have been listed under the section twelve of the
let me turn your attention to another case machang lalung in assam
so here the national human rights commission special rapporteur,
during his visits to the prison, notice that
a elderly person a mentally challenged person was
languishing in a prison for about fifty-four years
and in twenty s, this guy machang lalung was admitted
or was imprisoned, but after
about a decade of his imprisonment, his trial could
not proceed on account of his mental health condition
and but he as a result he
protection of human rights act
languished in the prison for about fifty-four years,
which is know a quite a good part of his youth and life
as a result of the neglect of the society,
as a result of the neglect of the authorities
and here was his substantive case,
which involved the human rights of prisoners
this is the commission took this matter
and made a recommendation to the government of assam
to release him and also later on,
the matter went to the supreme court
music
and the supreme court also ordered the payment of a
sum of rupees three lakh to machang lalung
so, there are many such instances where
a nhrc has intervened in a pending court proceeding
involving substantive human rights dimensions
so nhrc had been having a symbiotic relationship
or a with the high judiciary, in the sense that
music
where nhrc was not able to enforce its orders
it has taken such cases to the supreme court or the high courts
let me turn your attention to this graphic
for issue of writs orders for let's say in the case of
chakma hajong refugees in arunachal pradesh, or in
the instance of gujarat riots and there are many other cases
where the commission itself took matters to the supreme court of india
on the other hand, the supreme court also
remitted to the nhrc issues like punjab mass cremations,
of some two thousand and ninety-seven unidentified dead bodies,
or elimination of child labour, bonded labour,
or monitoring the conditions in mental hospitals
in agra, ranchi, gwalior and women's remaned home in agra
music
so there had been this kind of a
healthy relationship, a complimentary relationship between
higher judiciary on the one hand
and the national human rights commission on the other
the third is a,
visits to jails, mental hospitals,
music
and make recommendations for the protection of the human rights of
inmates living there
in pursuance of this statutory responsibility,
as we have seen earlier on nhrc has been given
the chairperson, members or the special rapporteurs,
or senior officers of the nhrc
have undertaken visits to prisons, documented
human rights violations, made recommendations in fact, if you
see in the year two thousand and sixteen and seventeen that is the last or the latest annual
report, which has been submitted to the government of india
it lists a number of such visits to the individual prisons by the
commission's rapporteurs and under each of these visits,
there are a number of lacuna have been identified,
documented, and a recommendations have been made
a range of functions, starting from redressal of
dear students,
to the concerned authorities for redressal of the conditions there
let me turn your attention to section twelve (d),
wherein there's a responsibility caste on the commission to
review, loss, either draft legislation or an existing legislation
and to make recommendations to the government
music
in pursuance of this, the commission reviewed
music
many legislations and made
music
music
very important recommendations to the government
in fact, if you look at the its old founding statute,
that is the protection of human rights act
the commission constituted a high level committee headed by
a former chief justice of india justice ahmadi,
and which went into this entire
working of the protection of human rights act
and then the nhrc after studying justice ahmadi report
made a series of recommendations to the government of india
for amending its own founding statute
individual complaints of human rights violations to intervention in
in specifically, it asked for
a number of additional powers some of these recommendations
have been accepted by the government and they have been
implemented, but there are some other recommendations which have
not been taken on board
in the same way, the nhrc reviewed
music
the freedom of information act,
reviewed the child marriage restraint act,
reviewed the persons with disabilities act
court proceedings, involving serious human rights issues,
and the anti-terrorism legislation like tada, pota, etc and
made substantive recommendations to government
in many of these interventions
have led to positive results with the government accepting
the recommendations
let me take you to the another
important statutory responsibility of the commission
namely, review of international human rights standards
under this the commission for instance,
made examine the existing standards
visits to jails, mental hospitals, begger homes,
in the year around two thousand
to optional protocols were adopted to the convention on the
rights of the children, one dealing with child soldiers, the
other dealing with trafficking in children, commercial sexual
exploitation of children so the
music
based on the recommendations of the nhrc,
the government of india signed and ratified these conventions
music
in the same vein, when the convention on the
nari niketans are to make recommendations
rights of persons with disabilities was adopted by the
un general assembly, the nhrc again commanded it to the
government for ratification, which the government did
music
the commission also recommended the signing of the torture convention
it was after the great deal of engagement between
an nhrc and the government, the government signed it,
but the ratification is still awaited the nhrc has been
making recommendations from time to time in its own annual
reports about the early ratification of the convention
for the protection of the human rights of inmates living there,
on torture, cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment or
punishment of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four
the commission also recommended
the accessions to the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-one convention relating to the
status of refugees and it's optional one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six optional protocol
and also accession to the additional protocols to the four
geneva conventions, which
have not been accepted by the government of india
the nhrc also has a statutory responsibility to
spread human rights literacy,
review of loss,draft bills
awareness through training programmes,
through seminars, workshops, internship and other such programmes
so nhrc regularly conducts such sensitization
programmes involving across section of civil servants, ngo's,
students, academia and other sections
the nhrc is required to submit annual reports
to the government and the government
is also required to submit an action taken report
on the recommendations of the human rights commission
music
and also review of international human rights standards and to
in the end, let me take you to the
other statutory responsibility of nhrc
namely, encouraging the efforts of non governmental organizations
nhrc, and the civil society have a
mutually supportive role in the sense that they ngo's,
which are often operated the
grassroot level, identify human rights violations, they bring
them to the notice of the commission and thereafter, they
submit fact finding reports
and in addition, they work as the
make recommendations
eyes and ears of the commission, and they undertake research projects
so there are many ways in which nhrc and ngo's
closely collaborate with each other
in conclusion, we have seen
that nhrc has to walk on many legs
and has a range of responsibilities
under the section twelve of the protection of human rights act
and we have also seen some examples of how it has
discharged his responsibilities under each of these functions
thank you
music
welcome to mooc on human rights in india
happy learning and see you in the next module
music
promoting research on human rights issues
spreading human rights literacy, awareness
and also increasing the efforts of non governmental organizations
in other words, nhrc is required to walk on
several legs, which can be broadly categorized as
protective function as well as promotional function
let us take each of these issues for a detailed examination
section twelve (a) of the protection of human rights act requires nhrc
to address individual complaints of human rights violations
and as we have seen earlier on these complaints could be of two kinds
in this module, we take up
acts of omission as well as commission by public servants
and the term human rights itself has been defined under section
two (d) of the protection of human rights act every year, the nhrc
receives around hundred thousand complaints
and this complaint redressal
is a major function of the commission
an individual who is a victim of human rights violation
or a non governmental organization
can send a complaint,
either through post, to fax, through email or an online
the activities of the national human rights commission
and it can be in any language
which has been recognized in the constitution of india
all that is required is that it should relate to a
human rights violation and
music
such complaints are registered in the law
division of the commission and given a unique case number
and a unique file number
and the complainants also can track the
status of their complaint disposal
as part of the learning objectives,
and these complaints relate to a
broad range of areas, which not only
are civil and political, but also can be economic,
social, cultural rights violations
for instance complaint can relate to custodial torture,
it can relate to false implication
and
music
police high handedness,
or it can also relate to, let's say,
music
denial of right to food, water, education,
social security, or many other things which are listed in the
economic, social, cultural rights
nhrc typically has a range of
music
courses open to it
after detailed examination the commission may choose to
dismiss a complaint in limine in case it doesn't come under the
purview of the protection of human rights act,
or in other words, it doesn't cover or it
we plan to achieve two things
is not a violation done by a public servant
or if it relates to a, let's say, a civil dispute,
or a complaint relating to non fulfillment of contractual obligation,
or if the complaint is vague or ambiguous
music
once a complaint is admitted, again,
there are, let's say, a commission can either dispose it off
with directions to the appropriate authorities
with a request to redress it or the commission can transfer the
complaint to a state human rights commission under section thirteen ( 6) of
one is what are these statutory responsibilities
the protection of human rights act for further
processing at the state human rights commission in or the
commission can itself take cognizance of the complaint and
issue a notice to the authorities concerned are the
commission can also ask its own investigation division
to do fact finding or an on the spot study
and submitter report to it
so these are the range of options which are open to the
nhrc and the commission has
where it found a prima facie violation as ordered payment of
that have been entrusted to the nhrc under section twelve of the
same is the case with
the un convention on the rights of persons with disabilities
so, these are some of the
positive intervention made by the nhrc
which will lead to successful outcomes in so far as
international human rights conventions are concerned
let's talk about spreading human rights, literacy awareness
the nhrc has a statutory responsibility to spread
human rights literacy
and awareness of the safeguards amongst the general public
and also the activities of the commission
in pursuance, the nhrc engaged with the
national council for education research or training ncert
and produced a source book on human rights
for teaching human rights in schools
it also engaged with the national council for teacher education
and produce materials for
teacher training on discrimination
involving gender, caste, and religion and other
prohibited grounds
the nhrc also engaged with the university grants commission
in this module, we will look at the
about teaching of human rights
at the degree and other levels as a either as a compulsory
subject or as a degree program in itself
music
in addition, the nhrc also organized training programmes for
public servants, members of armed forces,
and also many other categories it has evolved guide books for
judicial officers, online courses
so, today in fact, if you look at the contemporary situation
in the past twenty-six years
successes or achievements of the commission resolve its failute
since the establishment of the commission in the year one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three
there's a greater awareness about the what
the term human rights means
and as a result, people in far flung areas of the country be
tripura, be mizoram, be not in other
far flung areas are able to
send individual complaints of human rights violation to the nhrc
so the very fact that the commission is there, and has been
going around the country and making recommendations on
various important matters has laid and then coverage of the
we'll also look at the challenges faced by the
media of the nhrc activities
how all contributed in a big measure
to the spreading of the awareness of human rights
and it has had a positive impact on the society
nhrc also visited jails, mental hospitals, pursuant to
its statutory responsibilities and made many many important
recommendations for improving the conditions of those
institutions and all of them laid to some positive outcomes
let us look at the
music
national human rights commission before we go further, we need to
challenges faced by the commission
in fact as i said, the number of complaints
grew dramatically over the years
and this huge case load and huge workload is an important
challenge faced by the commission
this is coupled with lack of manpower
and lack of other resources and in fact
to the nhrc, if it has to effectively discharge its
mandate given to it by the parliamentarians, it needs more resources
it needs more staff, we were reviewing the challenges
understand clearly the nature of the body that we are talking
faced by national human rights commission
in fact, the paris principles require the commission to be
music
independent and autonomous
but let us look at the context in which nhrc functions
music
many members of the civil society say the
respect for a culture of autonomy is absent
and so in a way, the nhrc has a huge struggle
when all i'll explain this point further,
nhrc as the founding fathers or the legislative makers have in researched
let's say when all wings of the state, when all government departments
beat at the center or in states
music
respect and recognize the functional,
the financial and at the autonomy of the nhrc,
then nhrc will be able to give its best
minus this respect they then it's an uphill
struggle for the commission
let us having covered the
achievements of the commission having covered the challenges of
is a recommendatory body,
the faced by the nhrc
let us turn to the criticisms against the nhrc
section twelve (b) of the protection of human rights act
enables the commission
to intervene in any pending court proceeding with the
permission of the court, of course,
and in a matter which involves substantive human race issues
over the last twenty-six years the commission did intervene in a few cases,
but the activists would like would lve to see
more such intervention
it is not a court of law, it cannot issue binding orders
there are
many, many important matters which are being
agitated and nhrc has not done much in so far as the
promise of section twelve (b) is concerned
let us turn our attention to the
review of international human rights conventions
and to make recommendations to the government
the human rights council
and the various special procedures mandate holders
have given a blank cheque to the nhrc in terms of
or writs
dear students,
participation in various meetings in terms of
making substantive contribution to their work national human
rights commission's have not really done much in terms of
sending a shadow reports or alternate reports to the treaty
monitoring bodies
there are a few which have
used this provision and which have used the offer made by
the human rights council
or by the treaty monitoring bodies,
or by other special procedures mandate holders of united nations,
what happens when a body is a recommendatory body,
human rights council and have intervened very effectively
so here
the nhrc has a power to make its voice heard
at the international level
through the submission of alternate reports or shadow reports
here again, one would how allowed to see a
greater intervention by the commission
often nhrc sees compared to a toothless tiger
are an extension of a another
government departmen it's about the
it can
implementation of
the commission's recommendations at the grassroot level
the commission is also faulted for lack of compliance
with paris principles
in fact, there's one about pluralism,
the commission structure and composition should be such that
various cross section of the general public is expected to be
represented in the nhrc
but if you look at the commission many
civil society members hold that it doesn't really is not a
music
pluralistic body in two thousand and nineteen the government of india
came out with certain amendments to the protection of human rights act
and then it increased the number of deemed members from four to seven
by adding the chairperson of the
national commission for backward classes,
national commission for protection of child rights, and
the chief commissioner for personal disabilities has deemed members
there are several issues here first of all, there
are allegations that some of these commission's
at the highest level, the appointments are done on political lines
ask authorities concerned to range of things
even in a nhrc this appointment of chairperson members
has been criticized a great deal that it is the civil
society members say it is not done in a transparent manner
the public are not informed about the vacancies
and their qualifications, the manner of appointment
and the considerations for appointment so, as a result, there are
serious issues about the full participation of these deemed members
in the commission sitting so,
music
what finally is happening on the ground is that
like payment of compensation, punish those who are
the in a way there are six
chairperson and members
who are there in the nhrc place coupled with seven
deemed members in a perform sack it appears as if
the pluralism has been met
but in practice, this pluralism is not,
very effective, for instance,
the person's belonging to scheduled caste,
scheduled tribes, minorities or even women still feel that there
could have been a better representation in the
violating human rights or other recommendations but then it is
national human rights commission let us now turn our attention to the
independence which is again, very important principle,
which is one of the six main principles in the adopted by the
un general assembly and what are known as paris principles
why is our independence important?
music
the nhrc is expected to
adjudicate on important matters without fear or favour
and it is expected to be independent from the government
and only be responsible to the parliament
left to the sweet will of the authority concerned
to submission of reports etc
but administratively, it is under the
control of the ministry of home affairs
so, and the ministry of home affairs also has
wings like left wing extremism, central police organizations,
police and it also has a responsibility to control terrorist violence
so, there here is contradiction
so in other words, the full functional autonomy,
full financial autonomy, full independence is not
reality for the national human rights commission
whether they implement the recommendations in four weeks time
on the whole, we have seen that, in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three
a body was created through the protection of human rights act
for the better protection of and promotion of human rights in india
over the past twenty-six years, it has done
music
many things for realizing the promise of the
law makers, but there are serious criticisms as well
nhrc is expected to be the guardian of human rights
but, on the other hand, ngos
and members of the civil society often hold it as
or eight weeks time or six months or not implemented at all
toothless tiger
only in the years to come we hope that the nhrc will acquire
further strength and all the infirmities which are
there in the protection of human rights act
are plugged and that this body
meets the expectations of the general public
thank you
see you in the next module
music
so the commission doesn't have any powers to impose
welcome to mooc on human rights in india
fines or hold the officials who are not
implementing the recommendations for contempt
so he doesn't have a penal powers
so basically, it depends on the authorities for implementation of the
recommendations made by the commission
when you talk about
music
critical evaluation of the national human rights commission
one needs to bear in mind
section twelve of the protection of human rights act,
music
music
which has given several functions to the commission
in fact, section twelve mentions a list of areas
or list of functions, which are other words
statutory responsibilities of the commission
let us look at the performance of the commission
against each of the functions which are listed under the
section twelve of the protection of human rights act
twelve (a) talks about complaints redressal, anybody
or a non governmental organization
in this module, we will take up a critical evaluation of the
or sua moto commission can take up
cognizance of a complaint of human rights violations
committed by a public servant in fact, over the years
the number of complaints received by the commission
has registered a steady increase
and in fact, there are every year on an average
the commission receives hundred thousand complaints
secondly,
music
you look at the review of loss,
national human rights commission
which has been entrusted to the commission
over the years, the nhrc has reviewed
music
nearly fifty legislations covering terrorism
music
covering rights of women, children,
disabilities, manual scavenging
and its own founding statute protection of human rights act
and given substantive recommendations for legal reform
in fact, some of these have been accepted and implemented
in the earlier modules we have seen the paris principles
one particular instance is
is worth noting, that is, namely the eighty-six th constitutional amendment
by which the right to education was made a fundamental right
before that, the nhrc in its successive annual reports
drew attention to the need to
make right to education a fundamental right
so far as review of laws and other provisions
and our concern the nhrc has acquitted well,
and let's now turn our attention to review of international treaties
and make recommendations
and also the protection of human rights act,
the commission reviewed
music
the torture convention and urged the government of india to sign it
and as a result of persuasion of the nhrc,
the government of india signed the un convention relating to the
torture, cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment or
punishment one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four but the ratification is still awaited,
the nhrc has been of course advocating for early ratification
music
similarly,
the structure,
when un adopted
music
two optional protocols to the convention on
the rights of the child, one dealing with child soldiers,
other dealing with children involved in commercial sexual exploitation
or child trafficking, the
music
government accepted nhrc recommendation and
adopted or
signed and ratified these two optional protocol
composition functions of the national human rights commission
for the constitution of a
music
national commission for women and
state commission's for a women in different states
in order to promote the social
and economic development of women and also redress
the grievances of women relating to the deprivation of their right
the committee on the status of women
music
in particular recommended that
structure,
music
it should be a statutory body
music
and should be at an autonomous body
with the mandatory powers,
which certain recommendatory powers
in order to be in order to effectively discharge its functions
for protection of womens rights and that's how
the national commission for women act was enacted in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety
it came into force
music
music
in the month of january one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two
thereby establishing a national commission for women under a
statute that is national commission for the womens act
let us look at its mandate: it mandate briefly includes
music
study of constitutional safeguards, legal safeguards,
and to make recommendations for legislative measures, redress
grievances of women arising from violation of their rights and also
advising various policy measures to government of india
composition of the ncw
or states on issues concerning women
let me draw your attention to the graphic
about the functions of the national commission for women,
which have been provided under the section ten ( 1) of the
national commission for woman's act
the commission is responsible for number one, studying and monitoring
all matters relating to constitutional and legal safeguards
provided for women number two, reviewing the
existing legislations and suggesting amendments, wherever necessary
number three looking into complaints and taking suo motu notice
music
of cases involving deprivation of the rights of women
in order to provide support legal or otherwise to helpless women
number four monitoring proper implementation of all legislations
enacted to protect the rights of women to enable them to achieve
equality in all spheres of life and equal participation
in the development of the nation
and number five, undertaking promotional and educational research
and participating in and advising in the planning process of
socio-economic development of women
in other words,
what are its functions mandate and what are its powers
music
the functions under section ten ( 1) of the ncw act
educational and supervisory role and duties
in relation to women's rights in india
music
let us now turn our attention to the composition of the
national commission for women
according to the founding statute, the commission shall consists of
one chairperson, five members, and a member secretary
and the distinctive characteristics
in all seven member body the chairperson is expected to be
a person committed to the cause of women
and with a proven with a strong track record
and the members in other words, these five members
of the ncw or expected to be again
music
persons who have a good standing with a proven
experience and expertise in these matters
and then in the relevant areas
and the member secretary shall be nominated by the government of india
before we go further,
let me draw your attention to the
graphic about the current composition of the
national commission for women as of one st december two thousand and nineteen
mrs rekha sharma is the chairperson of the commission
and the members are smt kamlesh gautam, smt soso shaiza, ,
smt chandramukhi devi, mrs shyamala s kundar,
dr rajulben l desai and the member secretaries is
ms meenakshi gupta
as we have seen the ncw has been given a range of functions
under section ten ( 1) of the national commission for women act
i would like to give you a brief introduction
i'll draw your attention to the one particular function
relating to complaints redressal
in fact the commission has been given
the powers of a civil court under section ten ( 4) of the ncw act,
it can summon people, it can enforce attendance,
it can call for any public record while dealing with
complaints of violation of womens rights,
which have been received by it
the commission can also take suo motu court decisions
based on media reports
music
all these things are done under the complaints
and investigations cell of the commission
we will see the structure of the commission in greater detail and
how the commission is the work is structured among the different
cells of the commission
let me draw your attention to the
graphic about the structure of the national commission for a women
in particular, its work is distributed across
a number of cells, each of which is responsible for
a particular item of work please see the following graphic
for centuries
dear students,
the ncw carries out its function through different cells
they include complaint and investigation cell,
legal cell, policy monitoring and research cell, nri cell, north east cell
and there are suo-motu cell and there are
other cells dealing with public relations and media management,
psychiatric/custodial homes reform, capacity building,
women safety, women welfare and rti cell
of these cells, the
music
first three, that is complaint and investigation,
music
legal and policy monitoring and research cells are
extremely important and critical
the national commission for women on an average receives
nearly about fifteen thousand complaints
if you see the annual report for two thousand and seventeen - eighteen
it has received a little over fifteen thousand complaints
and these complaints are of various types and the most
important or the largest number of complaints have been under
the groups called right to live with dignity
dowry harassment or cruelty and police apathy
women have suffered discrimination
to the issues relating to women
these complaints are entertained by the commission
and then recommendations are made to the appropriate authorities
for redressal of these grievances
there are certain types of complaints which are not
entertainable by the national commission for women
these include
music
civil disputes, particularly those relating to
non fulfillment of contractual obligations, labour or industrial disputes,
music
for which there are separate tribunals which takes exist
or any complaint which is sub judice
are any complaint which is illegible, vague, anonymous or pseudonymous,
music
or any complaint which has been separately considered by
another commission which has been in existence
music
the basic idea is that there cannot be
parallel proceedings in two different fora at the same time
in relation to a particular matter
if you look at their social, economic,
take, for example, the service matters
there exists, central administrative tribunals
that exist state administrative tribunals and which are the
quasi judicial bodies
to deal with complaints relating to service matters
so those service matters,
which really do not involve any deprivation of
women's rights are not normally entertainable
by the national commission for a women
to some up, we have seen the constitutional provisions under
music
article one thousand, four hundred and fifteen we have also seen a number of specific legislations
which have been adopted, which have been enacted
for the protection of the women's rights and report of the
committee on the status of women in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four which recommended
statutory and an autonomous body
and that's how in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety the national commission for women act was
adopted and it came into force the year one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two
and a number of functions have been
entrusted to the ncw
basically, relating to review of constitutional
political status, they do not enjoy
and legal safeguards and to suggest recommendations for
policy reform or legal reform and also
redress individual grievances and also make recommendations for
to the government on various issues concerning
protection of women's rights
the ncw has the powers of a civil court
and so this in some is a the national commission for women
and as we have seen women have suffered
discrimination for centuries and have not enjoyed equal status
between the social, economic or political realm
equality on par with men often, this discrimination
and there's a long road to travels before formal
gender equality becomes a reality
thank you
see you in the next module
music
starts from womb and goes till tomb
music
it manifests such terrible acts like female foeticide,
welcome to mooc on human rights in india
infanticide
music
and
music
discrimination in access to
music
food, adequate nutrition, education, health care,
music
access to productive resources
music
over this module and the next module,
and it also manifests
music
such terrible things like domestic violence,
sexual violations
music
and so on and so for and also
poor representation in legislatures
music
in work force
all these challenges require that there should be
we will look at the national commission for women
music
a sound legislative
and institutional framework for protecting the women's rights
if you look at the indian constitution, article fourteen talks about
equality before law, equal protection of laws
music
article fifteen further prohibits states from making any distinction or
discriminating between categories of citizens classes
of citizens based on a number of prohibited grounds, which
includes discrimination based on sex, the state
music
music
can take special measures for advancing the interests of any
socially or educationally backward classes of citizens
music
these constitutional provisions outlined in article one thousand, four hundred and fifteen
have been complemented
music
by the number of womens specific legislations
that have been enacted by the parliament
these include among others,
the learning objectives for this module are two fold
music
others, legislations that have been brought out
music
regarding prohibition of dowry, sati,
music
immoral trafficking of women in decent representation of woman
or even sexual harassment, domestic violence,
or rape and other sexual violations
music
this in a sum provides the overarching, legislative
music
or legal framework for the protection of women's rights in india
if we look at the international scenario,
the universal declaration of human rights was adopted in the year one thousand, nine hundred and forty-eight
and it topped of very profound statement that all
human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, and
the talked of the enjoyment of all rights by men and women
equally and in subsequent years, there was the international
covenant on civil and political rights that was adopted in the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six
and the international covenant on economic, social and
cultural rights, which again was adopted in the year one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six
what are the
all these international developments
music
have led to the government of india,
constituting a committee to go into these status of women
in india in the year one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one
music
this committee after the detailed
examination of the ground realities,
as submitted its report in the year one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four
and this committee made a important recommendation
music
the qualifications have not been prescribed
the vacancies have not been advertised
but the government nominates the chairperson and members
of the national commission for women
music
the names of the persons proposed to be appointed are in public domain
it can generate a debate, it can generate a scrutiny
but if it is not done in a transparent manner,
the political considerations come into play
and people without substantial experience
the universal declaration of human rights was adopted in the year one thousand, nine hundred and forty-eight
at the grassroot level, in the women's rights issues get appointed
one can only imagine what will be their contribution
, in other words, it's extremely critical to appoint the right persons,
for discharging this onerous responsibility,
and that's why there's a need for proper selection,
need for proper scrutiny and need to ensure that only the genuine persons
with proven track record of experience in women's issues,
at various levels only get appointed to hold
these very responsible positions , in fact, on the this body,
the expectations of the fifty percent of women, the women's rights rests
it proclaimed that all persons are born free
, it's extremely critical to see that the appointment
process is done in a transparent way
while on this appointment process of chairperson and members,
it's very important to note a few more aspects
there are no worthwhile consultations with
women's organizations or the civil society
music
what happens when there is no such consultation?
the trust deficit increases
between the national commission for women on the one hand
and equal in dignity and rights, and men and women
and the civil society on the other
in fact in practice, they both need to work in tandem
to advance women's right but if there is a gap
between the ncw and the women's organization,
the gender equality movement becomes fragmented,
and it only affects the enjoyment of women's rights
this non inclusive process also can affect the
music
autonomy of the commission in the sense that if a political appointee
will not have the full freedom, to pass an adverse order,
are supposed to enjoy all rights equally
and so that's why it's a independence and autonomy
are critical to the success this function of the national commission for women
there is no coordination between national commission for women on the one hand
on the state commissions state commissions
are appointed under a separate legislation ideally,
there should be exchange of communication,
human_rights_in_india_2087
information and also strategies and the joint working
between these two bodies
working at the national level and at the state level
this is according the international covenant on civil and political rights,
that's in the best interests of the women's rights in the country
, that's why it is very important to have proper
coordination between ncw and the state commissions
and they insist ncw should be able to take a
leadership role in this process
among the commissions also one comes across
what can be regarded as a hierarchical
nature of the commissions in their status
music
for instance, there's a national commission for scheduled caste
which was adopted in the year one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six
or a national commission for scheduled tribes
they are constitutional commissions
and their origin is mentioned in the constitution
and the chairpersons of these commissions are equated in
status to that of a union cabinet minister
you look at national human rights commission
music
its chairperson and members are equated in status
with that of the judges of the supreme court of india
, and in this mileu for the
and again in the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights,
officials for the government servants, one can easily see the
hierarchical nature of these commissions and
when the chairperson and members of the national commission for women,
do not have a high status it will obviously impact
on the implementation of the day recommendations
music
let's say there is a violation of women's rights,
and if the national commission for women someone say unofficial
over to delhi to ascertain facts,
and what if that official doesn't turn up?
which will again or operate in the year one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six
and so what is the record to open to ncw
to compel the attendance of senior functionaries in the
either in the center or in the states? currently, there is not much
they can do to compel the attendance
though they have powers of civil court, they obviously need more powers
to compel attendance similarly, it can make recommendations,
but it has limited powers for enforcement of these recommendations
music
if you look at the national commission for women's act
the government of india is expected to seek advice
in other words, these three documents, these three instruments
from the national commission for women but what if the government
of india doesn't accept the ncw's recommendations?
what can ncw you do to enforce its recommendations?
there's hardly anything that ncw can do
many years back ncw brought out a black paper
we normally are aware of the white papers
but these black paper contained hundreds of recommendations,
which had not been acted upon by the authorities
,in a way they require additional powers in order to be effective
and the ncw looked at its own statute made
which i referred constitute the international bill of rights
dear students welcome to a mooc on human rights in india
or suggested important amendments, but these amendments
are yet to see the light of the day
, as a result of in practice ncw
comes across as a research body as a recommendatory body
though a number of functions have been given to it,
under the section ten of the ncw act that in practice,
it's a recommendatory or a research body
music
having said that, the situation is not entirely bleak
over the more than past twenty-five years, ncw has done a great deal
they all proclaimed that men and women have
for instance, mohini giri, as the chairperson,
has a past chairperson ,brought great visibility to women's issues
without much powers, and they have also initiated many research studies
held parivark mahila local adalats
but if one needs to see the critiques, and also the achievements,
one can say, it is a mixed record or the glass is half full
one needs to only see the gap between educational rights of women and men
music
the enjoyment of right to health by men and women,
music
equal rights in 1979,the un general assembly adopted
work participation by men and women
music
there is still a huge gap
and if you look at the situation of sc woman, st woman,
who suffer from double discrimination or that of a
disabled woman or minority woman, it becomes more complex
here is a body which has the potential
and which needs to be strengthened, further in order to realize
in order to to promote the social, economic
development of women to protect human rights
the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women,
thank you, see you in the next module
music
and this convention is called cedaw
was ratified by very high proportion of world's countries
in fact, one hundred and eighty-nine countries have signed and ratified it
and assumed all the legal obligations flowing from it
india also is a state party to the
convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women,
and if you see, in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy s, there was a feminist movement
in this module, we take up the second part dealing with
and in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five the un general assembly
decided to declare it as a international year of the women
and in the same year, there was a world conference was organized or in mexico
on the issue of women's rights
and at the end of which there was a program of action was adopted
and in that program of action, there was a clear message,
there was a encouragement to all states
to create national and autonomous bodies
for looking after the women's issues, looking after women's rights
and, in addition, the united nations has also declared,
the national commission for women in particular,
the decade starting from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six to one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five
as the un decade for woman and if you look at the indian scenario,
india was of course influenced by all these international developments
it participated in all these developments at
the un as a member of the un general assembly
and it's own committee on the status of women in india
submitted a path breaking , ground breaking report
with a series of recommendations urging government of india,
to constitutea national level, statutoryautonomous body
known as national commission for women to promote the social
we will see whether there is any critique of the
and economic development of women and also redress
the grievances of women arising out of the violation of their rights
in other words, the national commission for women did not
come out of any vacuum there was a series of developments,
right from one thousand, nine hundred and forty-eight onwards there was a movement
feminist movement, and which resulted ultimately
in the establishment of a national commission for women in the year one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two
under the legislation that was adopted in the year one thousand, nine hundred and ninety
, let us turn our attention to the critique of the commission
how did it act itself? it has completed now more than twenty-five years
national commission for women's functioning
, in the twenty-five years, has it gone far enough?
what has been it's achievements, what have been it's failures
and let's look at the critiques that have emerged
right from its inception for a body to be effective,
it needs to have a number of things,a:
it needs to have full financial resources at its disposal
, let us look at the kind of budgets,
which have been or grants which have been given to this body
they always hovered around eighteen crore to a little over twenty crores
see the, india we have about one hundred and thirty crore population
and how can it be made more effective body
and women hold half the sky and for fifty percent of the population,
you allocate a meager sum of us twenty crores
and if you really take it as a per capita terms it boxes a miniscule
you cannot really have a national body, give it a number of functions
and expect it to discharge all those functions without giving it,
an adequate budget and in addition to financial resources,
human resources are again very important right from the beginning,
the commission has been asking for
more and more staff in order to perform its assigned functions,
its statutory responsibilities
before we go further, let us briefly recall the
, let us turn our attention to another important aspect,
namely the role of the ministry of women and child development
though, in cw is expected to be
an autonomous body, yet it is administratively tied to the
ministry of women and child development for all its requirements,
be it staff, be it funds, be it sanction of administrative post,
it has to run to the ministry of women and child development
we have to see this in the backdrop of autonomous culture
in fact, institutions can flourish, where there is a genuine respect
for autonomy among everyone, but it's not so in practice
what has gone on before behind the creation of the
one body like this needs the full functional, operational
and financial autonomy in order to discharge the mandate given to it
by the parliamentarians, by the law makers
music
each of these aspects,functional, operational and financial autonomy
is critical to such bodies let's turn our attention to
yet another important aspect namely, the composition of the commission
and the manner of appointment of chairperson and members
women's groups have always held out that
this entire process is a non transparent one
national commission for women in fact, as you know,
,i draw your attention to number three,
the national commission for scheduled caste shall participate
and advice in the planning process of socio economic development of the
scheduled caste and to evaluate
the progress of their development under the union and any state
music
class four, it says to present to the president annually
and at such other times, as the commission may deem fit, reports on the
working of these safeguards
number five, to make in such reports,
in which the national commission for scheduled caste was established
recommendations as to the measures that should be taken
by the union or any state for the effective implementation of
those safeguards and other measures for the protection,
welfare and socio economic development of the scheduled caste
and you can see the function listed under
item number six basically, if you look at the items from one to six
one can find that the national commission's role
is essentially as follows
music
it has a role, which is advisory,
music
music
reporting, investigative, evaluative,
remedial, educational and supervisory
in relation to the rights of sheduled caste in india
music
further under class nine
music
of article three hundred and thirty-eight
the union government and every state government
is required to consult the national commission for scheduled caste,
if you look, the scheduled caste
on all major policy matters affecting scheduled castes
for the functions which are outlined in article three hundred and thirty-eight of the constitution,
the national commission for scheduled castes has been vested
with the powers of a civil court
human_rights_in_india_2306
music
article three hundred and thirty-eight class five, one and two in relation to
investigation of the constitutional safeguards,
or other safeguards or inquiry into complaints
the commission can summon any person
music
summon any public document or record and record affidavits
on owth and do a number of measures for discharging,
the responsibilities entrusted to it,
under the constitution one can see that
the national commission for scheduled caste
has been given a range of powers under article three hundred and thirty-eight
and it has also been given such an powers
and in pursuance the commission has been conducting
various activities, and which are all reported
in its annual reports, which are submitted from time to time
figure in the lowest rung of the social ladder in the social hierarchy
to the president of india, which include visits to states,
visits to jails and other institution,
review meetings with public sector undertakings,
or review of laws, regulations, and policies
and so on and so forth ,
let us turn our attention to this aspect of how can the
national commission for scheduled caste be made
more effective the commission has been
highlighting certain inadequacies to the government from time to time
for instance, the budget that has been allocated
and suffered practices like untouchability for many centuries
to the commission isn't sufficient enough
if you look at a few years back annual report of two thousand and fifteen - sixteen
it says that a sum of nearly fifteen crore
was allocated to the national commission for scheduled caste
and after accounting for salaries or other committed expenditure,
a paltry sum of rupees three crore is left for the the commission,
which isn't far enough and considering the
magnitude of the issue ,considering the enormity of the
problems ,considering the gap between the constitutionally guaranteed rights
and its practice or its realization at the ground level,
music
the commission needs far more financial resources
the commission doesn't have a separate budget head
in fact, it is tied to the ministry of social justice and empowerment,
and the funds for the national commission for the scheduled caste
are given as a part of the ,
the ministry of social justice and empowerment commission also doesn't have
power to engage consultants
manpower on a short term contract basis
music
all of this affects the functioning of the commission
and they face discrimination
in fact, for a body to be really effective,
it needs functional autonomy, operational autonomy,administrative autonomy,
and the commission has made a series of recommendations towards this end
and hopefully, the times to come,
it should get better and better and secondly,
the commission also found that there are
a number of other practical issues which affect it's functioning
for instance,
music
the powers of a civil court, it can summon officials
music
be it from the central government or from the state governments or
from the public sector undertakings
enforce their attendance, ask for any public documents records,
but it cannot issue injunctions
music
the commission feels that it is constrained because at times,
, keeping it as a recommendatory body
and keeping in view that there are investigation
or the inquiry into complaints require remedial action
and redressal of grievances there's a need for the commission's
and it has manifested in a number of ways, including in their access to
dear students welcome to mooc on human rights in india
words to make its recommendations binding
,in other words,it has asked for the amendment to its powers
in order to invest to the greater powers,
particularly the power of a civil court,
and to enable it to give a binding orders
in summary, or in conclusion,
we have seen the historical background to the creation of a
national commission for scheduled caste
we saw how centuries of discrimination has impoverished
the persons belonging to scheduled caste,
let us say temples, wells, public places and also led to
and there affected their social status, economic status,
political status, and left a gap
between them and the general population
and we also see the institutional framework
for the protection of the scheduled caste,
which evolved over a period of time from one thousand, nine hundred and fifty
starting with the commissioner for scheduled caste,
which was subsequently made into a multi member commission,
and then rechristened as a national commission
for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes,
severe violations like killings, assault, rape, etc
and how it was bifurcated in the year two thousand and four
as a separate commission for national scheduled castes,
and a separate national commission for shedule tribes
and we also seen a range of functions entrusted to the commission to
supervise the monitoring of the constitutional safeguards,
other legislative safeguards in fact, a number of legislations
in this connection have been enacted by the parliament of india
for instance, right from one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-five protection of civil rights act,and subs
thereafter, you know there were many the land reform act,
which came in and there was a prevention of atrocities
in fact, if you look at the enjoyment of
against scheduled castes and scheduled tribes act,
which was done in the year one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine
and rules were framed there under
and this act, called atrocities act was amended in two thousand and fifteen
and again, rules were framed under the amended act
the commission is expected to monitor the implementation of the
constitutional safeguards, which basically fall under several hits
there are in fact, social safeguards, there are economic safeguards,
there are political safeguards, and there are educational and cultural safeguards,
and there are service safeguards
rights by persons belonging to the sheduled castes
if you look at the constitution of india
and the affirmative action that it proposes to achieve
is unparalleled anywhere else in the world
and the size and scale of the reservations in
education and in employment is truly unparalleled
yet there is still a huge gap between the general population
and the scheduled caste in many areas
, they have got as a result of reservations,certain political status,
but as regards the social and economic status, there is still a long way to go
and, though the national commission for scheduled caste has been given
you will find that there is a gap between sc's on the one hand
a range of functions and also powers
it suffers from a number of inadequacies,
particularly shortage of financial resources, or manpower resources,
and it also needs more powers in order to be
truly effective in order to be a guardian of the
protector of the rights of persons belonging to scheduled caste
thank you see you in the next module
music
and the general population on the other
with regard to the enjoyment of right to education,
right to health, right to food, right to clean drinking water, right to livelihood
and these are important human rights issues indeed
and if you look at the situation of
in the course of this module and the coming module
music
scheduled caste women it is much worse,
and they suffer double discrimination on account of
belonging to the scheduled caste and being a women
in fact, if one examines
music
the number of people who are engaged in practices like
child labor, bonded labor and manual scavenging,
you will find that a high proportion of
people belong to persons from scheduled caste
we will look at the national commission for scheduled caste
, all these historical wrongs
music
have led to a serious violations
and that's why the framers of the constitution of india
have we know
music
provided special measures for the advancement of
socially and economically backward classes including sc's
music
as you know from the preamble of the constitution,
the learning objectives for this module are two fold
it talks about social justice, economic justice, political justice,
and after the constitution came into being in the year one thousand, nine hundred and fifty
came into force in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty
a need for a
music
specialized institutional framework was felt, for the monitoring the
legislative constitutional safeguards for persons belonging to the sheduled caste
and thus how,
music
in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty itself,
one, we will see the historical background for the
music
a commissioner for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes was appointed
and subsequently,
music
a need was felt for making this as a multi member commission
music
and that's how in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight
music
the commissioner for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes gave way to a
commission for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes
setting up of the national commission for scheduled caste,
and in the year one thousand, nine hundred and ninety through a constitutional amendment,
music
it was renamed as the national commission for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes
and in two thousand and four again through another constitutional amendment,
namely the eighty-nine th amendment
the national commission for scheduled caste was separated from the
national commission for scheduled tribes
in other words, the national commission for scheduled caste
is a constitutional body it's an authority which derives its source
it derives it's mandate from the constitution of india
and we'll also look at its mandate functions and powers
unlike statutory bodies, which are set up under an act of parliament,
i draw your attention to the diagram
please look at the following diagram for the functions of the
national commission for scheduled caste
article three hundred and thirty-eight class five says that
national commission for scheduled caste shall number one,
investigate and monitor all matters relating to the safeguards
provided for the sc's under this constitution,
or under any other law for the time being in force,
secondly, we will examine how can this body be made made more effective
or under any order of the government,
and to evaluate the working of such safeguards
, the operating words are to investigate and monitor
and also evaluate the working of constitutional and other legal safeguards
number two, to inquire into specific complaints
with respect to the deprivation of rights and safeguards of the scheduled castes
it's these two functions mentioned in
, class five, one and two are extremely important,
because the national commission for schedules caste has also been given
the powers of a civil court with regard to the exercise of these two functions
, let us look at the historical context
and adequate investigative machinery
so these paris principles are quite critical for the functioning of
any national human rights institution, including in nhrc
and also for the national commission for protection of child rights
dear students, now let us look at the composition
of the ncpcr under the commission for protection of
child rights act
the commission consists of a one chairperson, and seven members
the chairperson is expected to be
a person of great eminence with outstanding work the
education act or pocso that is protection of children from
issues relating to protection of children the six members are
expected to be selected from experts who have
child psychology, juvenile justice, child labour,
and in last relating the children and a number of other areas
in other words, this is expected to be a high profile
commission and these chairperson and members are nominated by the
government of india
at as far as the functions of the national commission for
protection of child rights is concerned, these
sexual offences act
have been specified in section thirteen of the commission for the
protection of child rights acts at this act interest the
commission with a number of statutory responsibilities
in fact, i draw your attention to the graphic, which follows as
regards the multiple functions which have been assigned to the ncpcr
as you can see, the commission reviews the
safeguards provided by or under any law for the protection of
child rights the presents to central government annually reports
relating to the safeguards inquiry into violation of child rights
examine all factors that inhibit enjoyment of rights of
music
children affected by terrorism, communal violence, riots,
natural disaster, domestic violence, hiv/aids, trafficking,
maltreatment, torture and exploitation, pornography and
prostitution and recommend appropriate remedial measures
in fact, these themes will give you and sufficient idea about the
issues concerning child rights violation in addition, the
commission also looks into matters relating to children in
need of special care and protection including children
in distress, marginalized and disadvantage children,
children in conflict with law, juvenile children without family and
children by virtue of their
children of prisoners and recommend appropriate remedial
measures the ncpcr also is expected to study three ds and
other international instruments and make recommendations
undertake and promote research in the field of child rights,
spread child rights literacy, inspect juvenile homes and other
such homes where children are kept and make recommendations
section thirteen ( 1) j is an important provision regarding inquiry into
complaints relating to violation of child rights
so if you look at the commission
is expected to walk on several legs and it
strength by virtue of their level of maturity,
enjoys a wide mandate in terms of its function, encompassing
advisory role, reporting, investigative, evaluative, remedial,
educational and supervisory duties in relation
to child rights in india in so far as inquiry into
individual complaints of child rights violation is
concerned, the commission has the powers of a civil court
it can summon any official, it can ask for any public document
it can seek any report, it can examine people on both, record
evidence and affidavits and infact the national commission
for protection of child rights assumes
or vulnerable for various forms of exploitation
music
different roles under the
music
commission for protection of child rights or under the right to
education act or under the
music
protection of children from
sexual offences act
now let us look at the pocso act of, two thousand and twelve
and they need special care and protection
music
act specifically provides that the commission
shall monitor designation of special courts by various state governments
and also the appointment of public prosecutors
in these courts for trying
music
various violations of change rights
music
issue of guidelines, training modules, spreading
awareness through media and are calling for individual reports
keeping this in view the constitution of india as a
on any specific issue involving violation of child rights or
assess the implementation of the pocso act in general
and make recommendations
the act also asks the ncpcr to collect data from various state
governments and other authorities on the manner of
implementation of the pocso act let us now turn our attention to
the right of children for free and compulsory education act or
what is known as rte act now, under this act, the commission
has a twin role one is to monitor the safeguards provided
under the rte act for the education of children and
number of provisions for the protection of children through a
secondly, to inquire into individual complaints of
violation of the deprivation of the right to education of children
under the rte act
music
if you see the juvenile justice act, it also requires the ncpcr
to monitor the implementation of the juvenile justice care and
protection of children act and also visit custodial homes,
juvenile homes where children are held for reformation and to
suggest improvement to the conditions there in
in conclusion, we see that a range of
constitutional amendment, article twenty-one dealing with right to
dear students,
safeguards have been provided
under the constitution, specific legislations, regulations and
policies for the healthy development and growth of
children and for the protection of their rights
and under the
commission, for the protection of child rights act ncpcr was
constituted in two thousand and seven with the commission consists of a one
chairperson and seven member it has been given range of
functions under the section thirteen one of the cpcr act and the
commission enjoys the powers of a civil court
life and personal liberty was amended to article twenty-one a was
and you have also seen how the commission assumes
different roles under the pocso act,
or under the rte act or under the jj act
dear students there is a big gap between
the legislative promise as contained
in the constitutional safeguards, specific legislative safeguards
and the ground realities
and so these national commission for protection of child rights
is expected bridge that gap are expected to see that
children enjoy a wonderful environment where there
inserted which requires the state to provide free and
they can develop in conditions of freedom and dignity
and in the coming module we will see the critical evaluation
of the working of the national commission for protection of child rights
thank you and see you in the next module
music
compulsory education to all children in the age group of six to fourteen years
in addition to the article twenty-one a article twenty-three of the
constitution prohibits trafficking in human beings and also forced labour
and article twenty-four of the constitution prohibits
employment of children in factories, mines and any other
hazardous occupations
music
these three articles twenty-one a, twenty-three and twenty-four are in the part three
welcome to mooc on human rights in india over a
of the constitution dealing with the fundamental rights
and you take up part four of the
constitution dealing with the
directive principles of state policy article thirty-nine (f)
in particular provides that children should be given
opportunities and other conditions into enable them to develop
in a healthy manner in conditions of freedom and dignity
so, these constitutional provisions have been supplemented by
a number of specific legislations
for instance,
course of this module and the coming module, we will look at
there is this prohibitation of child marriage act, two thousand and six and
music
there is a child labour prohibition and regulation act of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six
which was amended in two thousand and sixteen
and there is this immoral traffic act,
there is a pre-conception pre-natal diagnostic act, which
seeks to prohibit female feticide
and there are a number of other legislations which deal with
protection of the rights of children to take for instance,
right of children for free and compulsory education act,
the national commission for protection of child rights
which is called rte act in short and as i said earlier on, there was
a protection of children from sexual offences act
and then there is this juvenile justice,
care and protection of children act
music
and there are other legislations as well
if you look at the indian penal code, the criminal procedure code,
there are provisions which are child friendly
and which seek to protect the rights of children
these constitutional provisions, legislations have been
in particular, we will see what is the constitutional and
further supplemented by regulations
for instance, there were adoption regulations
there was a national plan of action, which was you know the early two thousand
it was enacted and it was further sub replaced with
more improved version of the national plan of action
there was a national charter, national children's policy
in fact, the national plan of action had a range of goals and strategies
and in order to achieve those goals and strategies, the talked
about the setting up of a national commission for
protection of child rights and state commission's in various
legislative framework for the protection of child rights
states for the protection of child rights
under these bodies be given sufficient autonomy
so that they can uphold child rights
we have seen the domestic provisions in the form
of constitutional safeguards, legislative safeguards and also
policies and other regulations if you turn your attention to
the international standards, the un general assembly adopted the
convention on the rights of the child in the year one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine which
came into force in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one
and in india, in fact, adopted india
what is the composition of the ncpcr and what are its
adopted in the year one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two and india also signed and ratified
two optional protocols to the convention on the rights of the children
if you look at the convention on the rights of the child
there are a number of principles particularly which
seek to uphold children's rights to life, survival and
protection, non discrimination, best interests of the children
and participation and these principles are also incorporated
in our domestic policies and plans of action by india
the commission for protection of child rights act was adopted by
functions in particular we will see what are its functions
national commission for protection of child rights was
established in the year two thousand and seven the non governmental
organizations and civil society hold that ncpcr by its very
character is like a national human rights institution
and they therefore argue that it should confirm to paris
principles, which as you have seen in the earlier modules,
talk about a wide mandate for the commission and also how it
should have pluralism, how we should enjoy autonomy from
government, how it should be independent for effective functioning,
how this body should be invested with adequate resources,
in relation to other specific legislations like right to
persons with disabilities act one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five was an important advance as it
it sought to protect the rights of persons with disabilities
it had a focus on the rights yet a number of critics say that
it provided government with many escape routes, as it limited
the enjoyment of many provisions to the economic capacity of the state
or the development of the state
and the presence of prevention and the early detection chapter,
in the persons with disabilities will also
not like it by the disabled activists
music
it's called rights of persons with disabilities act two thousand and sixteen
it was introduced in the parliament in two thousand and fourteen
and after due deliberation after due legislative process,
it was adopted before we go to the rights of persons
disabilities act, it's very important to see the international context
in fact, at the international level two there had been
many attempts at the un general assembly
which started with several non binding declarations or standards for
instance, there were declarations dealing with rights of disabled persons
or rights of mentally ill persons and these number of declarations
if you see in general, in one finds that
dealing with several categories of disabled persons
eventually led to the adoption of a un convention
on the rights of persons with disabilities
in the year two thousand and six india signed and ratified the un convention
of the rights of persons with disabilities
india did not sign the optional protocol to the
convention of the rights of persons to disabilities
here this convention again marked a big shift
in the way, disability was perceived in the way disability was understood
it focused not so much on the physical or a
the persons with disabilities face
impairment per se, but it looked at the social and other barriers
which prevented on the full enjoyment of rights on par with the others
so, here is a very interesting and very different definition of
disability that has been brought in by the un convention on the
rights of persons with disabilities, which has in turn inspired
developments at the national level also,
as india signed and ratified the un convention on the
rights of persons with disabilities,
there was a need for indian government to harmonize
the current legislations with the requirements of the un convention,
discrimination, exclusion, marginalization as a result of
and that in the process rights of persons
with disabilities was adopted in the year two thousand and sixteen
dear students, we were trying to unravel the legal framework
for the protection of the rights of persons with disabilities
we examined the constitutional provisions, we also saw the
provisions in the persons with disabilities act of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five
now, let us take up the rights of persons with disabilities act of two thousand and sixteen
in fact, as you know, india ratified the un convention
on the rights of persons with disabilities in the year two thousand and seven
which required that all existing laws must be harmonized
which they're unable to enjoy all human rights on par with others
with the requirements of the un convention on the rights of
persons with disabilities and that's
how this new act was enacted in the year two thousand and sixteen
and to replace the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five act
here, the number of disabilities have been increased from seven to twenty-one
they also include currently, things like thalassemia, haemophilia,
acid attacks and disability arising from
muscular dystrophy, intellectual or learning disabilities,
and parkinson's disease
so it's a very good this thing earlier in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five act
music
up these seven disabilities included the locomotor
or orthopedically challange,
visual challenge and hearing challenge and such and
these have been expanded significantly and to twenty-one in fact in
the rights of persons with disabilities act of two thousand and sixteen if you look at
the section two, there are several definitions given there
and a barrier has been defined as any
hurdle any, let's say cultural, social, physical and other
hurdle which affects the ability of a persons with disability from
enjoying rights on par with other human beings
there exists
so, barrier has been defined and discrimination term also has
been defined under section two as to include any
distinction, restriction, which affects
the enjoyment of a full range of human rights
civil, political, economic, social, cultural,
of a person with disability, on par with others
section two further defines a person with disability
as one who has a physical hearing, visual or sensory impairment
which, in conjunction with the barriers affects the full
participation of a person with disability on par with the
music
others and now this definition in the two thousand and sixteen act
takes inspiration from the un convention here the focus is
not so much on the impairment per se
the focus is the, on the impairment
and its conjunction with the barriers
which affect the full participation of persons with disability
in all walks of life
and so the reason is, there should be
full participation of persons with disabilities
in all walks of life now, if you look at
serious physical, mental, environmental, attitudinal,
section thirty-two of the rights of persons with disabilities act of two thousand and sixteen
it seeks to reserve not less than five percent of seats in
higher educational institutions government higher educational institutions
are funded by the government
and these five percent includes
for those with the benchmark disabilities
section thirty-four of the rights of persons with disabilities act
further reserves four percent of jobs in government sector,
out of which one percent shall be for those
with blindness or low vision,
cultural barriers to the effective participation of
dear students, welcome to mooc on human rights in india
and one percent shall be for locomotor disabilities,
which includes cerebral palsy, which include muscular dystrophy,
acid attacks, dwarfism and one percent for hearing impaired
or deaf out of this four percent reservation for jobs in the government sector
one percent is to be reserved for those belonging to
autism, mental illness, intellectual disability,
or multiple disabilities so, two thousand and sixteen act
which seeks to give effect to the provisions of the
un convention on the rights of persons with disabilities is a
important advance in the legislative framework
persons with disabilities in all walks of life, as a result of
now let us look at other legislations dealing with the rights of
persons with disabilities we have a national trust
for welfare of persons affected by autism, cerebral palsy,
mental retardation, and multiple disabilities of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine
this act arose from the demands of family members
for an effective arrangement of guardianship
in fact, this national trust act provides for
the appointment of local level committees and also
has elaborate provisions for the appointment of guardians
on there functions
which they become relegated to the, as a second class citizens
mental health act two thousand and seventeen is yet another important legislation,
it's seeks to amend modify the mental health act of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven
and also harmonize the mental health legislation
with the requirements of the un convention
on the rights of persons with disabilities that was adopted
ratified in the year two thousand and seven this mental health act of two thousand and seventeen
defines mental illness and also tries to provide for the
treatment, care of mentally ill persons
it decriminalizes suicide and says that a person who has attempted to
commit suicide shall be given proper treatment and care,
unable to enjoy the full gamut of human rights
so that he can be rehabilitated, and he should not be punished
for the attempt to commit suicide
and it recognizes that person as a person
who has undergone stress and as a person who
requires treatment
chapter five of the mental health act of two thousand and seventeen
outlines the rights of persons with disabilities and in
particular right to access mental health care, mental health services
in institutions run by government,
in hospitals run by government and also it also specifies
this is a very serious human rights issue indeed
the quality of such treatment and that should be affordable
and it should be of a particular quality and, and it should be
made available to all including those who are below the poverty line
if you look at the person's mental illness, they
suffered from stigmatization, the moment a person is branded as
a mentally ill person society tends to discriminate
them and their members of their families
and that's why the confidentiality is an extremely critical for
persons with disabilities and the mental health act therefore,
has provisions to ensure that the information relating to the
in fact, the persons with disabilities have organized themselves
treatment either mental health treatment or physical treatment
taken by persons with mental illness shall not be disclosed,
or their photographs shall not be release through the
media without the consent of the persons who are affected
now, section five also has a provision for an advance directive by
a person who is affected by mental illness, in that
that person who is not a minor can specify the manner in which
he or she can be treated, and in collaboration with the
mental health board, and this directive has to be supported by
an authorized medical doctor and the
and their families have organized and the ngos the civil society movement
authorized mental health board let us see
the way a mentally ill person is treated oftentimes up
electro-convulsive therapy or ect is administered to mentally ill person
with a view to cure them the mental health act of two thousand and seventeen
prescribes that no electro convulsive therapy shall be used on
minors and for others, whenever it has to be used,
it shall be used along with muscle relaxants,
and after administering and anesthesia the mental health act of two thousand and seventeen
solitary environment or in seclusion or they shall not be
have put pressure and have been responsible for changes in the
restrained shall not be used them unless they are absolutely necessary
there was one case which went to the supreme court of india,
that was by the sheela barse she brought to the attention of the court
to the plight of the non criminal, mentally ill persons
who were often held in jails and the supreme court held that
this practice is totally unconstitutional and illegal
so no non criminal, mentally ill persons can be held in jails
and if you look at the practice, like though
the mental health the act says that the
persons with mental illness shall not be held in
legal framework and evolution of a series of standards
restraints unless it is absolutely necessary
there was a massive fire tragedy in the erwadi in tamil nadu
where twenty-six mentally ill persons who were chained to their beds
died in a fire tragedy and in wake of that
the national human rights commission asked all the state governments to
certify that no mentally ill persons are chained to their
beds or held in such conditions
there is a rehabilitation council of india act of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six
which seeks to regulate the way special education programs,
the way training programs and other programs for
at the international level
rehabilitation of persons with disabilities can be conducted
we have seen a number of legislations
for the rights of persons with disabilities
they have been complemented by policies at the
central level and the state level as well
if you look at the central level, there is a disability policy
there is a national policy on mental health and
in addition to these legislative safeguards and
constitutional safeguards, there are other safeguards at
the international level, which are of two types
and today, we find that there is a paradigm shift
over the course of this module and the coming module, we will look at
they is a non binding standards by way of
declarations by way of the un general assembly self as
adopted a number of declarations for the mentally retarded persons
or for personal disability or mental illness
and there was a biwako millennium framework
there's a un decade, our asia pacific decade
and there is a world programme of action,
all of them constitute non binding standards, which are
supposed to guide the conduct of the states
and as far as some binding standards are concerned,
from a welfare based approach to a human rights based approach
there is this un convention on the rights of persons
with disabilities that was adopted by the un general assembly
in the year two thousand and six and which of course, india ratified in the year two thousand and seven
in conclusion, we have covered the provisions
in the domestic legislations as well as the international norms
for protecting the rights of persons with disabilities
what is required in practice is a strick implementation,
scrupulous adherence to these provisions and they need to be
viewed as barriers of rights not as objects of charity or pity
thank you see you in the next module
to the problems faced by persons with disabilities
music
now, let us turn our attention to the constitutional safeguards
or the legislative safeguards for the
persons with disabilities in india
article fourteen of the constitution talks about
right to equality and equal protection of laws
article fifteen and sixteen
prohibit discrimination based on sex,
race, caste, religion, place of birth, or any of them
the rights of persons with disabilities and the
and if you look at the directive principles of state policy,
article forty-one talks about the special efforts to be taken by the state
to secure right to work, right to education
in case of unemployment, in case of persons with old age,
persons who are sick and in case of disablement
so, we find that the word disable does not figure
in the part three of the constitution dealing with fundamental rights,
but in the directive principles of state policy,
it figures that states shall take special measures, in
cases of disablement subject of course, to the limits of
institutional framework for protecting their rights
economic capacity, subject of course, to the limits of
development of the state
when the constitution was drafted
music
there was a recognition of the
social disability on account of discrimination suffered by
persons belonging to schedule caste, particularly in their
access to temples in their access to waiting guards,
drinking water and other public places
but there was no recognition,
in this module, there are two objectives: one, we seek to
no proper appreciation of the plight of the
the persons with disabilities but the indian courts had been
at the forefront of an expansive interpretation of judicial interpretation
of various rights in the constitution of india
in nandakumar narayanrao ghodmare versus state of maharashtra
the supreme court ordered that a candidate
who was rejected from employment on the grounds that
he is a colorblind person was set aside and
the court order that he should be employed in one of the post
there are in fact, there were thirty-five posts for which
understand the legislative framework for the protection of
five alone required a perfect vision and the supreme court said
the remaining thirty posts which do not really require
perfect vision, he should be appointed
it was quite a progressive interpretation
by the apex court in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five
<insurt new tag time 6:30 to 6:32> persons with disabilities act was enacted
after a lot of struggle by the persons with disabilities
and their organizations
in fact, this item figures in the state list, but there was a
proclamation at the international level,
the rights of persons with disabilities
about the decade for persons with disabilities and
this observance at the international level, and this
international declaration enabled the government of india
to bring in legislation called persons with disabilities and
the full title of the act goes like this
and it talks about equal opportunities, protection of rights
and full participation act
in fact, the objectives of this legislation are two fold,
to enable the persons with disabilities to enjoy many rights
on equal basis with others, particularly the social
and secondly, what are the international standards
and economic rights and also their full participation in
various activities of the society
the persons with disabilities act identifies seven types of disabilities
and the model adopted here is one of a medical model and not
the social perception of disabilities
and there are several chapters in the persons with disabilities act,
which deal with non discrimination,
which deal with affirmative action, which deal with right to education,
employment and prevention and early detection,
and also persons with severe disabilities
which seek to protect the rights of persons with disabilities
people who are persons with disabilities can bring
individual complaints into the office of the chief commissioner
or the chief commissioner himself or herself, based on
media reports can take cognizance of the violation of
the rights of persons with disabilities and initiate action
in addition, section seventy-five (c)
music
requires the office of the chief commissioner to review
safeguards provided by or under persons with disabilities act or
any other law for the protection of the rights of persons with
and what are the functions of the ccpwd
disabilities and recommend measures for the effective
implementation
seventy-five (d) requires the chief commissioner
to review factors that inhibit the enjoyment of rights of
persons with disabilities and recommend appropriate remedial measures
the chief commissioner is also expected to study
treaties and other international instruments on the rights of
persons with disabilities and make recommendations for their
effective implementation
in the last module, we saw the
and what are the key achievements
provisions of the convention on the rights of persons with
disabilities and also saw that there are a number of non
binding standards at the international level
the chief commissioner is expected to undertake and promote research
in the field of rights of persons with disabilities
promote awareness of the rights of persons with disabilities,
and safeguards,
monitor implementation of the provisions of the two thousand and sixteen act,
and also schemes, programmes meant for persons with disabilities
and also monitor utilization of funds
of the of chief commissioner in india
dispersed by the central government for the benefit of
persons with disabilities and also perform such other
functions as the central government may assign
thus, we see that
music
there was a need for a
robust institutional framework
to complement the legislative framework
and that's how the two thousand and sixteen rights of persons with disabilities act
provided for the institution of a office of the chief commissioner for
music
persons with disabilities and section seventy-five of the two thousand and sixteen rights of
persons with disabilities act provided for a range of
functions and number of statutory functions to this office
and one such function is that of inquiry into individual
complaints of violation of the rights of persons with disabilities
in fact, the chief commissioner on his own
initiative without any complaint from any affected
individual or non governmental organization or family can
initiate action against such government authorities, such
government offices or statutory bodies, which are not
census two thousand and eleven
implementing the protective provisions of the two thousand and sixteen act
when the chief commissioner initiates an inquiry, he is vested with
the powers of a civil court
in fact, these proceedings are kind of a quasi judicial proceedings
he or the chief commissioner can summon people
ask for any public record and take a evidence on affidavits on
oath and make recommendations for the effective redressal of
these individual complaints , let us take up few key
achievements made by this office of the chief commissioner for
persons with disabilities there are a number of important
identified that there were nearly two sixty-eight crore persons with
interventions made by the office of the chief commissioner for
persons with disabilities
and if you look at the achievements of this office they
can be categorized under a few groups
one, he contributed significantly to the strengthening of the official
machinery for the protection of the rights of persons with disabilities
he advocated with the state governments for
appointment of state commissioners pursuant to the
advocacy of the chief commissioner many states have
appointed the state level mechanisms, state level
disabilities, who constituted nearly two twenty-one percent of the total population
institutional frameworks and thereafter the chief
commissioner had annual meetings with these state commissioners,
all of which contributed to the monitoring the implementation of
the rights of persons with disabilities
following his advocacy, many states have designated collectors of
districts as deputy or additional commissioners in
charge of disabilities and they also constituted medical boards
for issue of disability certificates
the chief commissioner took up with the
chief secretaries of various states
the government has come out with a more sensitive
and union territories on the need for issue of disability
certificates and streamlining this process on the whole
secondly, access is a major challenge for persons with disabilities
the office of the chief commissioner
conducted many access audits of public places like airports,
railway stations, bus stands, banks, post offices, hospitals,
and other such places of public use
and looked at it from the
angle of persons with disabilities and those who have
physical challenges, those who have other challenges and in
phraseology by way of terming them as persons with special
terms of access of displays and made recommendations for
removing the various barriers to these places, and all of it has
led to a significant improvement in the access of public places
third is awareness generation: the chief commissioner conducted
many national level workshops on inclusive education and
employment and give wide publicity to the mandatory
provisions for the appointment of persons with disabilities and
also the authorities responsibilities for reservation, etc
and you also produced booklets
the chief commissioner also
abilities or divyangjan in fact,
dear students, welcome to mooc on human rights in india
organized a number of initiatives for skill
development of persons with disabilities
the fourth major item is that of grievance redressal
in fact, a person with disability can send a complaint
about the violation of his or her rights, along with
his disability certificate and the chief commissioner's office
working as a civil court is expected to complete the
redressal of the complaint within three months from the
date of receipts and thousands of such complaints had been
redressed in the past decade or to and they are of various types
the non governmental organizations, disability activists hold that
they include service matters like top postings, transfers,
they include reservation in educational institutions
or extra time required for writing examinations etc
and a list of such illustrate cases have been given in this
module and they give a
student view about the
practical difficulties faced by persons with disabilities in day
to day affairs
and so this grievance redressal machinery
is an extremely important role for the office of the chief
the actual number of persons with disabilities could be much higher
commissioner for persons with disabilities
in conclusion, there are significant physical, mental,
cultural, social, attitudinal, and other barriers
faced by persons with disabilities
and the discrimination is also fact of reality and though
there exists legal safeguards there exist constitutional
safeguards, though there exists protective provisions in the
rights of persons with disabilities act
what is required is vigorous implementation and by the
chief commissioner and various state commissioners before these
the world health organization has estimated that
rights can become a matter of reality for persons with disabilities
thank you see you in the next module
music
seven to ten percent of any country's population are affected by some
sort of disability or the other or if you look at
music
the two thousand and sixteen rights of persons with disabilities legislation,
the actual number of
disabilities has been increased from seven to twenty-one
and
in this module, we will look at the institutional framework for the
music
the increase in the number of disabilities
music
in the two thousand and sixteen act, coupled with
discrimination faced by the divyangjan coupled with
physical, mental, attitudinal, and other barriers faced by
these divyangjan
music
called for a robust institutional framework to complement
the constitutional safeguards, to complement the legal safeguards,
protection of the rights of persons with disabilities
and in the last module, we reviewed
music
the legal framework for the
protection of the rights of persons with disabilities in detail
, we need a machinery, we need a mechanism to see that
music
all the provisions in these legislations are
effectively enforced at the ground level and that the
persons will disabilities are able to enjoy the full range of their
human rights on par with others
, before we go further, let me outline the learning objectives
music
this in brief we know is the
need for having a separate institutional framework
and if you look at the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five persons with disabilities act, it talked about
music
employment, it talked about education, talked about social security,
talked about barrier free access,
research and development for persons with disabilities
and it created a chief commissioner at the
national level, and the state commissioners in various states
for this module
to monitor the implementation of the provisions of the
persons for disabilities act, when this act was being
amended or replaced, in line with the
india's obligations under international law
in fact, in the last module, we saw
the un convention on the rights of persons
with disabilities that was adopted by the un general
assembly in the year two thousand and six and india rectified it in two thousand and seven
and there was a requirement to harmonize existing legislations,
existing legal provisions with the requirements of the un
in particular, we will see
convention on the rights of disabilities
and that's how
music
the legislation was brought
in the parliament and that legislation
initially talked about the national commission for persons
with disabilities and also some codes eventually after
deliberation in the parliament
finally, the two thousand and sixteen act came out with
the office of the chief commissioner for
what is the need for establishment of an office of
persons with disabilities at the center and provided a range of
functions for this office under section seventy-five of that act
i now draw your attention to the graphic,
which talks about the functions to be performed by the
chief commissioner basically, the chief commissioner is
expected to monitor the implementation, monitor the
compliance of various authorities with the with the
protective provisions which are there in the rights of persons with
disabilities act
section seventy-five (a) requires the office of chief commissioner of
the chief commissioner for persons for disabilities
persons with disabilities to identify suo motu or otherwise
the provisions of any law or policy program and procedures,
which are inconsistent with these act and recommend necessary steps
in addition the chief commissioner is
expected to inquire suo motu or otherwise deprivation of
rights of persons with disabilities
and safeguards available to them in respect of matters for which
the central government is the appropriate government
this is an extremely important provision
in the sense that
what is the vision behind this office
music
filed a public interest litigation in the supreme court of india,
drawing its attention to this grave inhuman, degrading
practice of manual scavenging
music
and this
music
led to
music
denials, counter affidavits from number of states
and in the face of important evidence set used by the
and what have been the legislative interventions that
safai karamchari andolan by way of photographs,
by way of other documentary evidence
this has led to some improvements and this has led to actions
on the part of the center as well as the states
this matter is still continuing in the supreme court of india
in the year
music
two thousand and eleven housing census brought to the four a very serious issue
and it mentioned that there are twenty-six lakh
insanitary latrines in the country
were made by the parliament of india to address the issue of
and it also drew public attention to the fact that
there are people who are been engaged as manual scavengers
to clean these insanitary latrines
and to the wake of this damning revelations
in the two thousand and eleven housing census,
the parliament came out in the year two thousand and thirteen
a new legislation on the prohibition of employment of manual scavengers
and their rehabilitation act
here the emphasis is both
music
manual scavenging, and you will also look at the
prohibition of the employment of manual scavenging, as well as
the rehabilitation of the those involved in the manual scavenging
here for the first time the terms manual scavenging
has been widely defined in order to cover
severs and other forms of insanitary latrines
going beyond the traditionally understood dry latrines
and there have been many new features which have been
brought in under this act
music
and national commission for safai kramchari was also
structure, mandate of the
given a very clear mandate, the national commission for safai karamchari
act was passed in the year one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three
under this act, the commission was constituted in the
year one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four
initially for a period of three years,
the expectation was that the commission would achieve its objective
in a short span of three years
but if you look at the current situation,
even after more than twenty-five years after the
adoption of this legislation,
national commission for safai karamcharis and
the manual scavenging is still a reality
that's how the commission was extended for a
period of three years each and in the year two thousand and four
the national commission for safai karamcharis act,
lapsed as a result today, the national commission for safai karamcharis
is a non statutory body under the ministry of
social justice and empowerment, and its mission is to
eliminate this dehumanising practice of manual scavenging,
and it has been given a number of functions
in fact, i draw your attention to the following graphic
also the critical a appraisal of this national commission
national commission for safai karamcharis is expected to
recommend to the central government a specific programme
of action towards elimination of inequalities in status,
facilities and opportunities for safai karamcharis
music
study and evaluate the implementation of the programmes
and schemes relating to the social and economic rehabilitation of
safai karamcharis; and scavengers in particular,
investigate specific grievances and to take suo-motu notice
of matters relating to non-implementation of :-
what is meant by this term manual scavenging ?
programmes or schemes in respect of any group of safai karamcharis
decisions or guidelines or instructions measures for
social and economic upliftment of safai karamcharis
oversee the implementation of the national action plan
for total eradication of manual scavenging
make periodical reports to the central governments and state governments
on any matter concerning safai karamcharis
the commission has also been interested with the task of
monitoring the implementation of the prohibition of employment as
manual scavengers under rehabilitation act two thousand and thirteen
in fact,
as per section thirty-one ( 1), of the said act, the commission shall perform
the following functions namely, :-
to monitor the implementation of the act,
to inquire into complaints regarding
contravention of the provisions of the act,
and to convey its findings to the concerned authorities
with recommendations requiring further action
and to advise the central and state governments for
effective implementation of the provisions of the act
and to take suo motu notice of matters relating to
music
non-implementation of the act
in the discharge of its above mentioned functions,
the commission have the powers to call for
information with respect to any matter specified
above from any government or local or other authority
let's come to the
assessment of the national commission for safai karamcharis
it faces a number of challenges relating to staffing,
staff shortages,funding for instance,
when you see that there are twenty-six lakh insanitary latrines identified in two thousand and eleven
it relates to
dear students,
housing census you can't eat the meager four crore amount
for the rehabilitation of people engaged in manual scavenging
third, the lapsing of the national safai karamchari commissions
act to the year two thousand and four
and the lack of quasi judicial powers, and it being a
non statutory body is unable to enforce its decisions,
unable to get its action implemented by the
concerned state governments or the central departments
there is yet another major problem
problem with the annual reports, which are often delayed
music
people say that there are just
achievements and activities of the commission,
rather than recommendations for a framework action by
other actors here are very, very profound issues
involving extreme form of untouchability, a dehumanising
a degrading practice, a hereditary occupation, and here is a
body which has been constituted to monitor
the implementation of the relevant legislation,
but without proper powers, without proper funding,
without proper manpower and other resources
the absence of pour flush
there is a still a long way to go to secure the rights of people
who have been forced to persist in
this heinous occupation and there's a need for
all sections of the society to be vigilant and confront this
grave human rights violations
see you in the next module
thank you
music
or water based latrines
here three things are involved a human being with a broom and a
tin plate and a drum removes human excreta carries it on his
or her head and dumps it at a dumping site far away
and it's a hereditary occupation and <insert new tag> as you know,
music
as you know
our caste system or a caste structure is rigid
welcome to mooc on human rights in india
and there is a hierarchy in the social structure,
and particularly, the so called lower segment of the
dalits have been forced to be in this
degrading, dehumanising practice
and, in fact, no tangible efforts were made
to improve the sanitation to enable
people to come out of this effort for many centuries
in this caste system itself if you see there is a reference to the
ritual purity, about the roles about the occupations performed
by groups and based on that they have been placed either above or below
in this module we will take up
music
and just because there are people who are engaged in
some unclean occupations
music
they face social exclusion
they face they are not allowed to participate
in all activities of the community
and the very nature of this activity leads to
many health complications, hazardous infections
to the skin of of the people, to the eyes, to the liver,
the national commission for safai karamcharis
to the gastrointestinal system and main at the respiratory tract,
and many other infections
one can imagine the human rights violations
faced by these communities who are
being forced by the rest of the society to persist in these activities
, let us come to the
music
legislative intervention
made by the parliament of india in fact, there was this
protection of civil rights act of one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-five
before we go further,
it was amended in the year one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six
under section seven (a) was inserted in the protection of civil rights act
what does this amendment say ? it goes like this
whoever compels a person, who on account of untouchability
is forced to do scavenging is compelled to do scavenging is
will this act has been criminalized, this
amendment seeks to punish any person
who forces another on account of untouchability
to do scavenging with an imprisonment for a particular term
music
i would like to outline the learning objectives for this module
this was followed by
music
another legislation
in the year one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three called employment of manual scavengers
and construction of trial it means prohibition act
the preamble of this act refers to the
dehumanising practice and the need to eliminate and the need to punish
those who use manual scavengers
and also to have a uniform law across the country
for preventing the construction of dry latrines and also for the
we will first learn what is meant by the term manual scavenging
rehabilitation of the manual scavengers
the national human rights commission,
recognizing this a very serious affront to human dignity,
took up this issue and in fact the
national human rights commission, as you know,
was also constituted in the year one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three
and it asked the government of india
to issue a gadget notification to enable this
employment of manual scavengers and construction of
dry latrines act to be notified and in fact, this notification is
and also see what are the human rights violations
important for several reasons it is for giving effect to the
or entry into the force of this act
and also, the nhrc urged the central government to
frame rules under the act many states
have denied the existence of manual scavenging
they did not take necessary efforts to
music
bring a legislation in their respective states
music
safai karamchari andolan a non governmental organization
raised by people who are forced to engage in manual scavenging
he need not give any reasons why he or she is
seeking a particular information and no personal details,
need be given by seeking information
excepting the contact details which are required
for supply of the information
in other words, the rti act has not prescribed any specific performa
or a format for seeking information under section six of the act
music
the only thing is that it should fall under the ambit of the act
and in where there is a dispute,
and what is the timeframe for giving this information,
whether certain thing falls under the ambit of the act or not
it is the courts which eventually decide
whether it does or in does'nt
music
the person seeking information has to pay
a modest or a mild a very very small fee described under the act
while seeking information
in fact, we have seen already the definition of information
which covers a wide range of things,
including records, documents, orders, etc a citizen has a
how does this right to information affect
right to seek information on orders etc but he cannot ask
why such orders have been passed by authorities,
especially the judicial authorities
, let us the turn our attention to as to who is a
public authority in fact, the central government,
state governments or any body which has been established
under the constitution of india, or any legislation passed
by the parliament or the legislature this is a public authority
in fact, units which are owned bodies which are owned
controlled or substantially funded by central government
the enjoyment of human rights ?
or a state government are also regarded as public authorities
non governmental organizations which are substantially funded
by the government are also regarded as public authorities
in fact, one can seek information from them under the
right to information act in fact, every public authority is
required to designate public information officers and also
other officers to receive appeals against the decisions of
the public information officers
this when a citizen files an application
or an rti query, asking for information
these are some of the things we will look at, in this module
there are only two courses of options which are open to the
public information officers in case the information
exists and in case the information is held by
that particular public authority, the public information officer
is expected to accept the application and provide the information
and the second option is that in case the information is not held
by the authority in case if the information is not
covered under the rti act
the public information officer can reject such application
, either of which should be done within a timespan of thirty days
music
from the date of application
there are several exemptions for furnishing of information,
which are provided under section eighty-one and nine of the rti act
they exempt public authorities from disclosure of certain information,
under certain reasons
in fact, i draw your attention to the following graphic
and please pay close attention to the graphic to know the
exceptions to the disclosure of information
for instance, the section eight prescribes the following grounds for
rejecting a person's request for disclosure of information:
article nineteen of the universal declaration of human rights
if it pertains to national security,
or sovereignty and integrity of the nation
national economic interests, relations with foreign states,
law enforcement under the judicial process,
information available to a person in one's fiduciary relationship,
cabinet papers and other decision making documents
trade secrets, intellectual property and commercial confidentiality,
individual safety, personnel privacy
infact, the following three grounds of rejection can be
cited by the public information officer under "public interest"
that was adopted in the year one thousand, nine hundred and forty-eight
trade secrets, intellectual property and commercial confidentiality
information available to a person in one's fiduciary relationship
personal privacy:
section nine allows the rejection of a request for
disclosure of information that would involve
the infringement of a copyright, subsisting in a person
other than the state
dear students we saw in the earlier graphic,
the items which were exempt from disclosure
under section eight ( 1) of the rti act
and also article nineteen of the
infact the act also provides that after a lapse of twenty years
after the incident to which the information relates
these items should be exempt from what you call
the operation of this non disclosure
in fact, so, there is a twenty year time limit provided under the act,
after which they cease to be exempt from disclosure
except in a few cases, what are those cases ? for instance,
if there is a information which relates to the sovereignty and
integrity of india or it relate to the strategic or
economic interests of the state or it relates to the maintenance
international covenant on civil and political rights of one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six
of friendly relationship with other countries
or secondly, if there is any information,
the disclosure of which constitutes a breach of privilege
of parliament or the state legislature
and information relating to union cabinet decisions
or state cabinet decisions or meeting of the committees of secretaries
these will however, continue to be exempt from disclosure
even after the lapse of twenty years
,
music
both assert the right of every citizen to seek,
dear students,
if you look at section twenty-four of the rti act,
information relating to the intelligence wing of the state
or some security organizations have been exempted from the
purview of this rti act
and these list of such organizations are specified in the
second scheduled to the rti act
and the union government and the state governments are empowered to
amend this list from time to time
i draw your attention to the following graphic,
which talks about various authorities under the act
receive and impart information and ideas
and the timeframe for entertaining or disposing of
the first query under the rti act or details for entertaining the
first appeal and the second appeal
in addition, we look at rti act
music
there are detailed provisions relating to the constitution,
functions and powers of the central information commission,
state information commissions which are mentioned
and in fact, in the coming module, we will look at the operation of the
this central information commission in greater detail
and if you look at our old constitution,
thank you
see you in the next module
music
which was drafted around the same time as the udhr
article nineteen ( 1) (a) upholds asserts are guarantees
freedom of speech and expression
and to give effect to this right to freedom of speech and expression,
rti act was enacted in the year two thousand and five
and it replaced the freedom of information act of two thousand and two
and how does it affect human rights ?
music
welcome to mooc on human rights in india over the course of this
for instance, you know corruption, impedes,
the enjoyment of civil, political
as well as economic, social, cultural rights
the right to information is a powerful tool in the hands of
the general public in order to have a corruption free
administration in order to have access to critical information
for the enjoyment of their rights including right to food,
education, health, social security and many other rights in these manner,
right to information acts as a enabler to realize other human rights
rti act basically empowers citizen to seek information from a
module and the next module, we will look at the right to
public authority and the information can be of diverse kinds
and the rti act itself defines information in a very expansive manner
and through this, person can hold the government
accountable can hold the administration accountable
in fact, there was a civil society movement in rajasthan
which was started by kisan mazdoor shakti sangathan
and which really ask for master roles for rural employment programmes,
poverty alleviation programmes and unearth corruption
and they held the jansunwais and it was this movement
which really resulted in the enactment of the right to information act
information act as also the central information commission
and under which there is a central commission
and there are state information commissions
and if you look at the section twenty-two of the right information act
the rti acts as a over-riding provisions,
wherever there is a conflict between rti act on the one hand
and other laws say like official secrets act
in fact, the adoption of the rti act represents
a paradigm shift from an era or a regime
governed by under the official secrets act to a transition to a
era or a regime governed by transparency and accountability
and state information commissions
sections two of the rti act contains definitions and
the word information has been defined
this information means material of any kind
may include documents, records, file notings, logbooks,
contracts or material held in any electronic form
and many other things like maps, photographs, and
so on and so forth
and here is the definition of what constitutes information
and supreme court of india in a particular case involving
central board of secondary education on the one hand
in this module, we will first take up the right to information act
and aditya bandopadhyay and the other,
made a distinction between three different categories of information
they said on the first category is information which is of
which is held by a public authority, which is of critical importance to the
music
citizen and non disclosure of which may affect
the transparency or it may affect corruption
on the other hand, there is a category b, which talks about information
held by a public authority which is not covered by category a
and then the third category contains information which is
what are the various provisions of this rti act?
not held by a public authority,
or which is not collected by a public authority
the supreme court said both in terms of first and second categories
the information should be supplied to the citizen
when asked for in particular, as regards the first category,
information, disclosure of which can fight against corruption
fight against non transparency
the court said the public authorities have a
duty suo moto to disclose that information
they have a duty to under section four of the rti act
what is information? who can seek
proactive disclosure all through their websites and other modes
as regards second category, person can
file an rti query and seek that information
as regards the third category,
that is namely the information that is not held
or collected by a public authority
the court said this is not covered under the
ambit of the right to information act
the section six of the rti act any person can seek to information
from a public authority
it and from whom it can be sought?

and how those who are using wheelchairs
are unable to get into the aircraft in a dignified manner
quite often their wheelchairs are physically lifted, and they are placed in the
flight and in a which is a manner
violation of their human dignity
in response, the supreme court directed the government
to provide ambu lifts, which can take a person

provide them il chairs and other directions
only on a single issue, like children's rights,
in another case, the disability rights group
complaint against the election commission before the courts of law
stating that while on the one hand the constitution of india provides
a right to vote, universal adult suffrage,
but there are practical difficulties in accessing the polling booths
and this action by a non governmental organization has infact,
led to an important order by the supreme court of india
directing the state to make these polling booths
accessible by creating grams, and by providing
other facilities to various categories of persons with disabilities,
women's rights, bonded labour, child labour,
so that they could realize their right to vote
common cause, which is another
registered non governmental organization filed a
petition before the supreme court of india on the right to speedy trial
and the supreme court also gave a direction that
a right to speedy trial is an important facet or a dimension of the
article twenty-one dealing with right to life and personal liberty
you take for instance, people's union for civil liberties,
which is a national wide non governmental organization
deeply concerned about starvation deaths in rajasthan
and there are some who work on a range of human rights issues
it moved a petition before that supreme court of india,
and it's a matter concerning a right to food
and very important right in itself and the supreme court
issued notices to all the states in addition to state of rajasthan
and passed a series of interim directions
over a course of decade or , on the realization of right to food
which is a very landmark case in the history of supreme court of india,
and it is also widely regarded in many other countries of the world
, the ngos use the strategy of
filing repetition or complaints to the national or state human rights institutions
and there are some which are confined to a particular district
in addition, they also seeknon judicial
administrative measures or remedies from the
central or state or local authorities
,they also use the research and documentation
as an important strategy for instance, they work at the grassroot level,
they work at the local level, they work at the state and other levels
and they bring out comprehensiveevidence based
high quality reports on burning human rights issues
let me give you a few examples
the center for science and the environment
or state and there are some which work across the country
as brought out a number of studies onclean air
pollution,drawing public attention
to the hazards are also seeking
appropriatesteps from the governmentpratham
a non governmental organization brings out on an annual basis
a comprehensive report on right to education of children
and the state of its implementation and which is again,
used by many scholars, government agencies, and others for taking remedial action
oxfam brings out a report on poverty
and these are only just a few examples there are many otheragencies,
or in a particular region of the country
non governmental organizations, which bring out
comprehensive reports on serious human rights matters
and these are used to by the national human rights institutions,
used by courts of law ,used by our governmental agencies
in addition to these few strategies,
in g was alsoraise funds for their activities
for instance, as i said, they are outside this pay law of government
and depend on international development agencies, charities,
foundations, etc for their funding
the ngos also build up alliances
and there are some inter governmental
in fact, when they build alliances with the like minded organizations
they can draw attention to a cost quickly
and they can also collective energies and collective efforts
to advocate for human rights costs
but it's just there is a jan swasthya abhiyan
which is a conglomeration of twenty networks
and thousand odd, ngos and individuals working across the country
on the realization of right to health
there is a national alliance of grassroot ngos nagn
which works on child rights so the ngos often build alliances
or international non governmental organizations
and use these alliances as a strategy to secure their goals
ngos also use legislative advocacy for securing
changes in the law reform or policy reform
and they also use media advocacy,
and use the internet, the digital media
and online petitions and other a internet based strategies
for drawing attention to the serious human race issues
and also for awareness generation
in fact, naming and shaming
has a critical role in the task of protection and promotion of human rights
like, the amnesty international or the human rights watch
nobody would like to be known as a human rights violator
and would like to avoid public ridicule,
avoid criticism at any cost
, ngos through a clever strategy of media advocacy
can name and shame, human rights violators
and thereby secure better protection of human rights
thank you
and many other examples are there ,there are different
dear students, welcome to ugc mooc on human rights in india
types of non governmental organizations that are around ,
what is their relationship with the other wings of the state?
as you know, the in the national human rights protection system
the nhri occupies a pivotal role and it complements the role of
the legislature, the executive and the judiciary,
the civil society of which the non governmental organizations
are an important constituent also complement the efforts of the
other three wings of the state as well as an nhri's, in fact,
the non national human rights institutions
act as a bridge between the government on the one hand
in this module, we'll take up role of ngos
and the non governmental organizations on the other
, how do these ngos advance the costs of human rights?
they employ a variety of strategies
in this exercise, but it says let us take three d monitoring process
today, there are over seventy legally binding international
or multilateral treaties that have been adopted
under the auspices of the united nations general assembly,
and they constitute international human rights law
and of which there are nine core treaties
, countries sign and ratify them and undertake
in the protection and promotion of human rights
a variety of legal obligations these include reporting from time to time
and the ngos feed into this treaty monitoring process in a number of ways
for instance, a state, which is expected to submit
a state party report is supposed to conduct
a broad based in consultation with various stakeholders across the country
before it finalizes its report the ngos can feed into this process
in addition, the non governmental organizations often
submit what are called parallel reports,
alternatives reports or shadow reports,
they depict the reality in a different manner
what is an ngo? it's a as the name suggests,it is outside the government
in fact, the government reports quite often might claim that
the picture is a rosy one as far as
the protection and promotion of human rights in the country is concerned
before an international audience ,before the un treaty monitoring bodies,
while on the other hand, the actual reality
at the ground level could be far from satisfactory
so the non governmental organizations through their shadow reports
bring to the attention of the treaty monitoring bodies,
the realities at the ground level
in addition, when the three d monitoring body
it is expected to be an independent from the government
engages with the state in issue in question
the ngos also prepare a set of questions that could be put to the
state and also,eventually, at the end of the process
when the treaty body use a set of concluding observations or recommendations
ngos also monitor the follow up action taken by the states
they disseminate the recommendations of the treaty monitoring bodies
widely within the country and also monitor
the follow up action taken by the state
and where the follow up action is deficient
they put pressure on the state to see that
it is a legal body legally registered of persons,who come together
proper follow up or implementation of these critical recommendations is carried out
the ngos here employ a variety of means,
for instance, they file rit petitions before the
courts of law or before statutory bodies like
national human rights commission,
national state human rights commission's
national commission for minority, children's commission
or sc or stcommission, or the central information commission
or state information commission's and seek remedy
for an individual victim or a group of victims of human rights violations
for carrying out certain activities
let me give you a few examples
for there was a legal aid services forum in west bengal,
which was aided by a former judge justice d k basu
when confronted with a series of custodial deaths,
custodial violence cases, which were reported in the media
the chairman, executive chairman of this legal aid forum,
wrote to the supreme court of india through a letter
drawing its attention to these terrible atrocities
to this terrible human rights violation and requested the
supreme court to pass a series of directions
there are different types of ngos
as the result, the supreme court issued
a number of important directions, which are displayed
in all the police stations of the country
and these are monitored and the court also made it clear
that if these are violated
it would treat them as a content of the code itself
, let me give you a few more examples
javed abidi, was leading a disability rights organization
in fact, he was deeply concerned about
how our transportation systems are not
for instance, there are some which work
music
they do put pressure on governments
to stop in their tracks to stop further torture
in fact, there was a prisoner
in the dominican republic, who was a labor leader, and his name was
julio de pena valdez he acknowledged that
with every batch of letters his treatment got better and better
and eventually, he was released so today, amnesty international
is an important international non governmental organization,
which works at the international level, which intervenes in the
human rights council, which intervenes in many other un fora
a very important role putting pressure on the
and advocates for the production and promotion of human rights
let me now turn my attention to another important
international non governmental organization called human rights watch
it consists of four hundred staff members, worker working across
many countries of the world it was established in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight
every year it brings out more than one hundred reports
focusing again on more than one hundred countries of the world
and these reports are solid reports
based on in depth research at the ground level
after collecting facts after painstaking documentation,
united nations, putting pressure on the
and these reports contain recommendations to national authorities,
intergovernmental organizations, united nations
and other stakeholders, and these reports
have in fact led to the protection and promotion of human rights
in many countries across the world
in fact, human rights watch works on a range of issues,
including business and human rights,
counterterrorism, refugee rights, civil and political rights,
and the entire gamut of economic social cultural rights,
and it has been able to make a significant difference
international non governmental and putting pressure
at the world level for promoting human rights
now, let me give you one more example
called international federation for human rights, or its abbreviation is
fidh, in it's a federation of
organizations that are about one hundred and eighty-four organizations working across one hundred and twelve countries,
out of all of them employ a range of means or tools
for,protecting human rights defenders, and in particular,
woman human rights defenders, and they send urgent action responses
and they also employ a tool called strategic litigation
and , in this tool
on the intergovernmental organizations, putting pressure on the other
intervene in the international criminal court
whenever there are serious cases of concerning war crimes,
crimes against humanity, genocide, or they also intervene in
internationalized tribunals or hybrid tribunals like the cambodian one
they also intervene in the european court of human rights
and fid hatch brings out a report
on the status of human rights defenders across the world,
highlighting flagging serious challenges faced by the
human rights defenders as a result of their work
and these tools which fidh have employed have led to
important stakeholders to advance the costs of production
lot of positive outcomes for the human rights organizations across the world
forum asia is an asian organization,
again, an inter governmental organization
it was founded in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one in manila,
like other ngos, forum asia also
uses tools such as research, documentation,
publication of reports, capacity building,
at the international level, or at the regional level
and they have a unique program called national human rights institution program,
which looks at the national human rights institutions
and promotion of human rights before we go further,
in the asia pacific region, whether they are performing well
or not, and if not, they do send
observer missions they do send teams for on spot
investigation to ascertain facts and based on these,
they publish or they issue press releases,
they get into media advocacy, they get into legislative advocacy,
and using all these using high quality reports,
they have been able to effectively
influence the production and promotion of human rights
in the regional bodies, either at the asean or sark
these international non governmental organizations have been having
or other countries in asia and also at the united nations,
in conclusion,ngos employ a variety of means
to advance the production promotion of human rights
and there are some international ngos
which reached a very high level of organization
and they operate in more than hundred countries of the world,
on topics or themes selected by them, and they are making
an important difference and they are able to change outcomes,change law,
change policy, change state action, put pressure on state
whenever it violates human rights and we have seen
a great impact at the world stage
the amnesty international, the human rights watch,
the international federation of human rights fid hedge and forum asia,
there are many others who are also doing similar work
for example, there is an international rehabilitation council of torture
and there are many, many organizations which are working
and all of them using a range of tools
to protect and promote human rights
thank you
for instance, there was an international campaign on land mines
for long, it was known that the landmines were maiming,
dear students, welcome to the mooc on human rights in india
injuring people and were leading to a lot of human rights violations
and the efforts of non governmental organizations we're not
leading anywhere and in this context,
a range of international ngos came together
and advocated for adopting a binding multilateral treaty
which eventually ended up with the adoption of
water war treaty banning the production, deployment of
anti personnel landmines and it is a successful story
a half how ngos can build alliances across the world,
and how ngos can advocate and bring about
in this module, we will take up the role of international
an important changes in the multilateral rules
take for instance, rome statute for international criminal court
way back in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-eight the genocide convention provided
for international tribunal to try the crime of genocide
as and when it was established between forty-eight to ninety-eight
for five decades, there was no prospect of a
permanent standing international criminal code
to try such serious offenses as genocide
maybe because of cold war rivalries,
maybe because of many other strategic and other reasons,
non governmental organization with the help of a few case studies
it did not come through in fact, it was a
coalition of non governmental organization,
which came together in the form of cicca,
coalition for international criminal court,
whichin conjunction with a group of small and medium countries,
were able to pursue it the powerful countries
and which eventually led to the successful conclusion of the
rome statute for international criminal court in the year one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight
and today, the court came into is there
and it is permanent add in from since two thousand and two
today,as a result of the globalization,as a result of the
it has been functioning effectively
and so, this again is an important example of
how international ngos can come together
and in conjunction with small and medium countries could
bring out our make others adopt
important multilateral human rights treaties
let us take a few case studies
you've all heard of amnesty international
or how did this amnesty international
which act walks across the world come into being
free movement of people, the global transportation links,
in fact, in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one there was a british lawyer peter benenson
he was deeply moved when he came across a case of
two portuguese,students who were present
their only fault was that they raised a toast for freedom
in fact, he sent out he published a article
in their observer appeal for amnesty
in fact, this appeal was printed by media organizations across the world
and there was a momentum that was generated,
which eventually led to some successful outcome for those prisoners
in the years that followed, amnesty international
the globalized communications, the interpenetrating world economies
has grown in strength and it
there is an international secretariat
in the london and there are national sections in many countries
and there are volunteers acrossing, walking across the world
and it doesn't accept money from governments
it works on purely donations from members and private individuals
it works on issues such as abolishing of capital punishment
it works on torture it works on prisoners of conscience,
human rights, education, and many other
such important human rights issues and it employs a range of tools,
through trade the world in a way has become
including in depth research, publication of reports
for instance, every year it brings out an answer
and annual report on the state of human rights in the world,
which gives the trends, which are mentioned about the serious challenges
faced in individual countries or in different regions of the world
and in addition to these report on a
the state of human rights or reports on particular teams,
amnesty international also issues, press releases from time to time,
putting pressure on the government's putting pressure on
other agencies for promotion of human rights
global village and in this context,
let's say aprisoner of conscience is being tortured
amnesty international has an urgent action network
and there are a group of individuals
who put out an appeal
and this appeal is addressed to the prime minister,president
and all other major authorities in the country
and it's also there are expressions of support
to the prisoner concerned and his family members
when one gets hundreds of letters,
telegrams, faxes, emails from across the world, from different corners of the world
the international non governmental o rganizations have been playing
music
they're supposed to be established
in full conformity with the what are called paris principles
that were adopted by the united nations general assembly in the year one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three
these paris principles require that a national human rights commission
should have a wide mandate, not necessarily
civil and political rights, but also economic, social cultural rights
and it should also have functional autonomy and independence
and it should have diversity and pluralism in its composition
and these paris principles are so important
and in fact, world over there are more than one hundred and twenty
when you look at india, the people's union for
national human rights commission's and there is a body called
global alliance of nhri or ganhri,
which accredits the nhri depending on the
extent of their compliance with the paris principles
those nhri's which are fully compliant with the paris principles,
get 'a' grade accreditation and they have full rights of participation
in the proceedings of the human rights council
on the other hand, there are institutions which are partly compliant
and which are not compliant they get b grade with an observer status,
or c grade, and so with each grade having its own privileges
civil liberties comes out as a very important actor or player
,it's very important to interragate,
the way nhri's are constituted in different countries
in fact, how are their members and chairperson appointed?
how are they selected? what is the level of transparency that is followed?
do they represent the various sections of the
or a cross section of the society in that country?
is there pluralism in its composition? do they inspire confidence
these are matters which are taken up by the ainni
and it looks at today if you see our indian situation,
you have national human rights commission
in the wake of emergency that was imposed in the year one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five
and state human rights commission in states
and you also have national commissions for women,
minorities, scheduled caste, scheduled tribes
with their counterparts in various states
and we also have an office of the chief commissioner
for persons with disabilities, and also a state commissioner
for persons with disabilities and you all have central information commission
and then state information commission's
altogether there are over one hundred and seventy
nhri is our state human rights institutions,which are under operation,
lok nayak jaya prakash narayan
it's very important to critically look at them
and evaluate them appraise them
to see whether they are conforming to the
internationally recognized paris principles are not and if not catalyze them
it's not seek policy reform is not seek legislative reform
, that they are in full conformity
with the universally recognized standards
it's very important for the effectiveness
it's very important for the independence of a body
the moment you recognize human rights are seniors, bonding matters
founded the people's union for civil liberties
these are rights of an individual and they need to be
protected and promoted, and they are constitutionally guaranteed
and dignity is an important value in the preamble of the constitution
at the same time, you the institutional machinery
that is created to realize these constitutional ideals goals
the legislatory mandate that is a adopted or enacted
by the framers or by the lawmakers need to be realized
in fact, ainni came out with a first civil society report
on nhrc when it went before the accreditation, before the
united nations constituted body in the year two thousand and eleven
and democratic freedoms or democratic rights in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six
and five years later, ainni again came out with a
far reaching report on the extent of nhrc india's
compliance with the paris principles, thereby
putting pressure on the indian government, putting pressure on the
other authorities to take a critical look at the existing legislation,
take a critical look at the protection of human rights act
with a view to amandate, with a view to make
the human rights missionary more effective
we also have a people's watch tamilnadu, which was established in madurai
it works on a number of issues, including woman's rise,
and after his death, this organization has undergone
serious civil and political issues it works on legal aid to the victims
it works on filing complaints, securing,compensation,
restitution for victims of serious human rights violations,
particularly woman, persons belonging to scheduled caste,
scheduled tribes and other marginalized sections
the people's watch has also took up a novel initiative for spreading
human rights education across the country, particularly
training school level teachers and for developing
a human rights consciousness among school children and among school teachers
thank you
some further changes initially, it was supposed to be beyond
political leanings so that people from all
political parties could come together and work
dear students, welcome to the mooc on human rights in india
for the protection and promotion of human rights in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty
and revised, renewed people's union for civil liberties came into being
which is a basically a membership driven organization
and it does not accept funding from any agency whether indian
or international, and it is it runs through the voluntary
contributions of its members and there are member lawyers
who, from their own funds, prepare cases, read petitions
and advocate for the victims of human rights violations
the pucl uses a variety of means
for the protection and promotion of human rights
we have already seen how non governmental organizations
it has instituted in award called journalism for
human rights award, which is given out year after year
as you know, media is an important ally
in the task of production and promotion of human rights
and media often exposes serious human rights violations and thereby secures
better protection for the task and of human rights,
and the institution of an award to recognize
and imminent journalists for the work he or she has done
he goes a long way in furthering the protection and promotion of human rights
the pucl also organizes an annual
employ a variety of strategies to advance the protection of
jaya prakash narayan memorial lecture on twenty-three rd march
in fact, it was on this day that the emergency was lifted in india
and to commemorated celebrated academic celebrated activists
every year delivers an annual jay prakash narayan memorial lecture
which goes a long way you spreading awareness about human rights
the pucl also brings out a monthly publication
called pucl bulletin in english,
which reports the serious human rights issues,
which reports the challenges confronting india,
which also contains a number of critical pieces
and promotion of human rights and they are an important
about the current state of fir's and this publication
is well regarded across the world and is followed closely
by human rights activists and other non governmental organizations
, let me give explain to you some of the important cases
which were taken up by people's union for civil liberties
in fact, in rajasthan the pucl notice that
on the one hand, there were granaries overflowing
food corporation godowns overflowing and in the immediate vicinity,
and there was also the sorry spectacle of starvation deaths,
deeply moved by the allied human rights considerations
constituent of the national human rights protection systems
it filed a writ petition before the supreme court of india
on right to food and the considering the importance
and significance of this case the supreme court also issued notices
to all the states of the country, and it passed a number of
important interim directions over a course of a decade on
anti poverty programs and other
social welfare schemes, pension schemes, and including
midday meal scheme, including antyodaya annan yojana
and many other schemes, directing the state to see that
right to food of everybody is protected in particular
and we have also seen certain case studies of
pregnant woman, elderly persons, persons with disabilities, etc
and this case is a l andmark in the history
or annals of human rights jurisprudence in india
there had been many other cases
which were taken up by the pucl concerning payment dwellers
in bombay their eviction rehabilitation,
fake encounters in manipur, telephone, tapping
and communal riots, mental illness
in fact, in delhi, there used to be a shadra mental asylum,
and which has been renamed as institute for human behavior and analysis
international non governmental organizations
the number of laws were also challenged
the number of laws which a transgress
the individual's human rights were challenged by pucl
and in the supreme court of india
, in other words, pucl works across the country
has individual constituent units in various states
and it through its members through its member lawyers
using research, documentation awareness generation
and other means, it furthers the costs of
protection and promotion of human rights and it has
in this module, we will examine some best practices evolved by
a number of important achievements to its credit in the last few decades
, let us turn our attention
to another important organization called ainni
ainni is an association of individuals and networks
a watching or monitoring the national human rights institutions
in fact, its birth was inspired by the similar organization,
which is working at the asian level called anni
anni,this is an association of ngos monitoring
national human rights institutions at the asian level what does anni do in india
in fact, if you look at the national human rights institutions,
indian non governmental organizations
music
very serious acts of violence against women in the jessica lal murder case,
in the priyadarshani matoo murder case or also nirbhaya case
where these acts have really shaken the conscience of the country
and conscience of the humanity, particularly the nirbhaya one
like which led to the public outcry and the kind of reporting
that was done by the media led to the constitution of a high level
task force headed by justice j s varma and which in turn,
put together for reaching law reform proposal and it how
it ended up with the parliament enacting criminal law amendment act
in the year two thousand and thirteen and in this episode, some new offenses
but there has been a tremendous revolution in the field of communication
have been added, including stalking, voyeurism, sexual harassment,
and the rape itself has been expanded in a great deal
with a stringent punishment for various acts of rape
and so on the one hand, you find that in priyadarshani matoo and jessica lal
murder cases, the sustained campaign by media has led to
securing of justice for the families of the victims and in nirbhaya case
it also led to the punishment of the
perpetrators and also ended up in a law reform
you are aware of the campaign launched about by an ngo
called bell bajao campaign in fact, it is about domestic violence
and it has been it's a mind boggling technological development
it is a television, video short television video jingle,
who was a victim of domestic violence
go up and ring the bell and with a view to prevent the domestic violence
and this was a very stunning campaign in the media,
which focus public attention on the need to address domestic violence
in a squarely important manner you see the coverage in the past few years
about the equality movement, particularly how a woman
should have a right to enter all temples, including those temples,
which had either to be not open to the woman
that have taken place about a few decades back
and so, these campaigns have had a very important positive effect
and it they lead to the social changes, they lead to the
change of attitudes, they lead to the improved outcomes for women
, there is yet another jouneral of rural reporting
it was you know, it was a new ,it was a niche area, which was propounded by
nominant person called sainath who visited rural areas
and painstakingly documented the distress of farmers
and the corruption at the rural areas, the starvation deaths and his
in depth, his systematic reports in the rural areas
in the hindu newspapers have led to a lot of changes
the what was the display held by the newspapers
have led to a lot of public attention to a often neglected area
,this also led to the conferment of
important awards on sainath on the media reporting
has also had many positive effects
national human rights commission can take action on a complaint
either by a victim or somebody on the victims behalf like an ngo
or it can also has a power to take so much cognizance based on the media reports
and the nhrc indeed takes regular cognizance
of serious media reports, dealing with custodial violence,
starvation deaths, and other violations of economic,
or radio,television has given way to the digital revolution
social cultural rights and civil and political rights
and these cases, which have been, you know, initiated
as a result of media reports have also led to a positive outcome
and positive impact for the victim of such violations
parliamentarians often use such media reports
to draw attention of the government in the zero hour or in the question hour
and use these reports to hold the executive accountable
in fact, media has a constructive role in becoming a bridge
between communities, but any insensitive any sensationalism,
any unfair reporting can also divide the communities
today, we have twitter, we have facebook, we have instagram,
can they can in fact, it can lead to the deepening of the fissures,
deepening of the divisions, caste, communal
and other divisions existing in a society
, in conclusion, media has a very important role
in the task of protection and promotion of human rights
it can be an ally, it can be watchdog,
it can expose violations, it can mold public opinion,
it can shape public attitudes, it can be an instrument of social change, but
in any improper portayral in the media, any unfair reporting,
any sensationally reporting can also lead to human rights violations
we have mobile sms, we have all these devices,
in other words, it has a role for positive as well as a negative one
and it has it has a great power
and that's why it's very important to recognize that power
and it's very important to channelize that power through self regulation
and to ensure that the predominance of politics,
cricket, fashion news, and other such frivolous things,
some form of it which masquerades as a news
and it's basically infotainment and it the views and infotainment
often masquerade as news so they all need to be corrected,
the need for greater media ethics, and this is in sum total,
which like whereby there is an instantaneous
the role of media in the protection and promotion of human rights
thank you
transfer of information and the people you know, across the world,
get to know serious issues concerning everything
dear students, welcome to mooc on human rights in india
beat politics, beat, security or other development, including
burning issues relating to human rise and
it's a on your handheld device,
and instantaneous transmission has
really led to a total change in the way media impacts us
and media in fact, let us briefly dwell on the role of the media
in fact, media is regarded as a fourth estate in a democracy,
complementing the efforts of the other three organs,
including the legislature, executive, and judiciary
it is it can be a formidable ally, in the task of
in this module, we take up the role of media, in the protection of human rights
protection and promotion of human rights
it can be a fearless watchdog, holding others accountable
it can be an instrument of social change,
and it can be a source of early warning
for conflicts, genocide, orphamines or many other issues
, in other words, it has a tremendous role it has a
tremendous impact and it has a tremendous power
and in the constitution of india, article nineteen talks about
freedom of speech and information whereby the freedom of press is
inferred or implied from the article one (a) of the constitution
we have already seen the role of legislative,
, let us see now, how media impacts both in a positive way
and in a negative way and what is his relationship between
human rights protection and promotion
let us see a few generous of
journalism or media reporting
a few decades back, there was a journal
of investigative reporting came into being
in fact, it was in bhagalpur of bihar
some detainees were blinded by police personnel
by pouring acid into their eyes
executive and judiciary, in the task of protection and promotion
it was a gruesome custodial violence
and it was reported by the indian express,
which led to a filing of a public interest
litigation before the supreme court of india it led to
a lot of action against the errant police personnel
so in this case, you find that media has exposed a serious human rights violation
and in fact, in the following years, there were many such
investigative stories about trafficking of
women and children are corruption or other such serious
human rights violations so by exposing such violations,
of human rights that will let us media is an important part of civil society
the media has a role to mount public opinions to shape
public opinions, a set agenda of the for before the country
and let's look at corruption in fact, corruption is a serious
human rights violation and we have a right to be free from corruption,
which is also regarded as a human rights in itself
the corruption impacts negatively on everyone,
and particularly the enjoyment of economic social cultural rights
by the poorest sections of the population
when that being so media
has in fact exposed several acts of corruption
in fact, it has a critical role
in a very fearless manner, one has to only recall
how several years back the sustained reporting of an arms deal
and also recently about an arms deal have really focus public attention on
standards of transparency, standards of ethics required in governance
let me turn our attention to about a year back a major case
which came to be known as panama papers
this panama papers is about the leak of
about eleven million files held by a law firm called mossack fonseca,
it was operating in forty-two countries in fact,
it was the fourth biggest in the world and catering to over three hundred thousand
several centuries back before the invention of the printed word,
companies and many rich people, many influential people
exploited it to stash away illgotten wealth in several
offshore tax havens and these data files were
through an investigative reporting secured world secured by a german newspaper
and that german newspaper in turn handed it over
to a international consortium of investigative journalists
and the revelations were mind boggling
there were senior political leaders from iceland,britain, russia, ukraine, egypt,
pakistan, india, and many other countries were reported upon
and in fact, it led to the resignation of then iceland
it was the oral tradition it was the word of mouth communication folk tradition
prime minister and the supreme court of pakistan
passed very important order, holding that the then prime minister nawaz sharif,
whose name came out in the panama papers leak case
was unfit to hold the position of the prime minister
and consequently, there was a follow up action that was taken against him
and india has self has also launched a multi agency task
force to go deep into these allegations
we have seen the investigative reporting, we have seen the corruption
let us turn our attention to media and women's rights
in fact, there are a few instances of violence against woman
which was regarded as a traditional media
music
represented by the supreme court on the high courts
are the custodian of fundamental rights are provided
or guaranteed under the constitution of india
and the public interest litigation
as it evolved over the years, and the supreme court
and the higher courts within india have advanced the cause of human rights
which we will see in great detail in the coming modules
, we will also see the work of civil society,
particularly, the role of media and role of ngos,
role of trade unions and economics in the task of
these different elements in this module
protection and promotion of human rights
we have seen the , at the national level,
the role of executive legislature judiciary
and civil society and how does it connect with the universal system
, let me read out to you what the united nations has said
in fact according to un, "important elements of a national protection system
include one laws consistent with
international human rights standards
number two, effective functioning of courts, judiciary and law enforcement,
as well as independent human rights institutions, or ombudsman
first, let us take up the notion of human rights
number three, procedures for individuals to
effectively claim one's rights
number four, good governance and accountable
government institutions that promote and protect human rights
number five, democratic, open, transparent
and participatory
,decision making process strong civil society
including a free and independent media
in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three un general assembly adopted paris principles
in fact, the national human rights institutions
what are human rights?
areexpected to be comply with these paris principles,
which basically say that nhri should have a wide mandate
and they must have a plural composition
in terms of its membership, and they are expected to have
both functional ,autonomy and independence
, these paris principles are very critical
for the effective functioning of a national human rights institution
in fact, at the united nations level
there is a global alliance of national human rights institutions
which accredits nhris, those which are fully compliant
human rights are those rights which accrue to a human being
with the paris principles and participate in the
human rights council and its meetings and they have full speaking rights
on the other hand, there are partly compliant
or non compliant human rights institutions,
which do not have such full participation rights
, in a way, nhris play an important role
in the protection and promotion of human rights
and they complement the work of legislature ,executive ,judiciary
and civil society just as all human rights belong to
all human being, the task of protection and promotion of human rights
merely by virtue of being born into the human family
is the responsibility of everyone and different wings
which we examine in this module and in the coming modules,
we will take up for more in depth examination,
the paris principles and the work of national human rights commission of india
and a critical appraisal of the commission and also
the work of the legislature executive, judiciary ,civil society
for intensive examination,
the national human rights commission and also the paris principles
will be subject matter of number of modules in this coming weeks
and so in conclusion, we have this national human rights protection system
and they belong to everyone, regardless of any distinctions based on gender,
at the core of it is the nhri's,
which complement the efforts of the
other wings of the state, namely legislature,
executive, judiciary, and the civil society also
is an important actor in the national human rights protection system
thank you
race, and so on and so forth
whether a person is from
majority community or minority community
whether the person is rich or poor, whether the person is differently abled
human_rights_in_india_4580
or otherwise, every human being is expected to enjoy
the full range of human rights
in fact, the world conference on human rights
which was held at vienna, in the year one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three came out with a
declaration and a platform for action
in the vienna declaration one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three it was asserted that all human rights are
universal, indivisible interrelated and inter dependent
, today, these human rights have
become so significant are so important they in fact,
set limits on the state's actions
dear students, welcome to week one module one
let us now see the international system
under the united nations under the un general assembly
a range of binding conventions or non binding standards
on human rights have been adopted there are what are called
charter based bodies and treaty based bodies and they constitute
what is called an international system
and it is complemented by
regional systems for the protection and promotion of
human rights in europe, the americas, africa and other regions of the world
, we have international system
onz the national human rights protection system
represented by un and then you have a regional systems
and both of them are complemented by
what are called national human rights protection system
in fact, these national systems
act as a let me first give you an overview of this system
you have this diagram, which captures the
in a graphical manner, the national human rights protection system
at the core of the system is a national human rights institution
in fact,if you see in some countries
the source of the nhri is provided in a in their constitution
we will take up this notion of human rights
or in a specific statute and they are supposed to be independent,
not just a government department,and they are supposed to be autonomous
and with their funds being voted or approved by the parliament
and these are unique entities,
and they're neither part of government, they are nor civil society
and but they are autonomous, and they are pivotal
or at the core of the national human rights protection system
on the other hand, you also have legislatureexecutive
judiciary, which are three wings of the state
each of these wings of the state their powers and functions have been
and also its significance thereafter,
explained or given in detail in the constitution of india
,each of these three wings have a specific role
a specific responsibility for the protection
and promotion of human rights these three wings of the state
are complemented by the work of the civil society
, what is this civil society it is a,
this term is used to connote the non governmental organizations,
the trade unions, the academics, the media, and other
who are not part of the government
and , in fact, the national human rights institution
try and have an understanding of the production system
is expected to be a bridge between
the government on the one hand and the civil society on the other
let us briefly look at each of these institutions
let's say legislature: it's main task is expected to
pass legislations and the members of the legislature's
have adopted a number of legislations,
guaranteeing the rights of specific groups of people like woman,
children, persons belonging to scheduled caste, scheduled tribes,
minorities, persons with disability, etc
in addition, the members of parliament
available in the world at large and then come to the
can used a range of means for protection of promotion of human rights
they have a question hour, they have a zero hour
they have a call attention motion,
and they have many other legislative means to advance
the protection and promotion of human rights
in addition, there are parliamentary standing
committees on many specific subjects,
including woman the welfare of scheduled caste social justice etc
they also advance the task of human rights
,the executive is tasked with the
national human rights production system
enforcement of laws and also evolve
policies, programs and schemes and if you look at the government of india
there are ministries, which like focus on
a woman and children's development, labor,
social justice, disability or minority affairs,
health and family welfare, human resource development
, the work of each of these ministries
is critical for the protection and promotion of human rights
, let us look at the role of judiciary
judiciary, particularly the higher judiciary,
and its various elements we will also see the relationship between
music
the court read principles of reasonableness in article fourteen
the supreme court said article fourteen strikes
at arbitrariness in state action and ensures
fairness and equality of treatment
the principles of reasonableness,
which legally as well as philosophically is an essential element of equality,
or non-arbitrariness pervades article fourteen like a
brooding omnipresence and it goes on
the approach of reading reasonableness has made new developments in the law
arbitrary or unreasonable actions
ashoka rock edicts, also resonate a few human rights,
according to the court are per se, discriminatory
article fifteen to eighteen expand the scope of
equality mentioned in article fourteen in particular,
article fifteen prohibits
discrimination based on caste
religion,race etc in the same article, in the same article
there is a provision for,
for making special arrangements
for socially and educationally
backward classes of citizens or for
including the right to food
persons blonging to scheduled caste and schduled tribes
article sixteen prohibits discrimination in matters of public employment
in particular, this article keeping in view,
the principle of treating equally,
it says that state can make special provision for
persons belonging to scheduled caste,scheduled tribe
or rather backward classes in matters of public employment
with a view for their adequate representation
article seventeen abolishes the practice of
untouchability in all forms while article eighteen does not removes
in fact, if the ancient indian notion of dharma
the conferment of titles by the state article nineteen deals with
six essential freedoms which include among others, freedom of speech
and expression, freedom of association,freedom of assembly
and freedom to practice, occupation,trade,business,etc
this is weapon to citizens and can be exercised throughout
the territory of india but this is not an absolute right,
but is subject to a number of reasonable restrictions which are mentioned in the
chapter three of the indian constitution
for instance, take right to freedom of speech and expression
it's very important, right, in a democratic setup
it does not mean a set of religious laws,
andthis has been expanded by the
courts in a number of cases and the supreme court has also read
freedom of press as a part of the
freedom of speech and expression,and this is subject to
a number of reasonable restrictions based on
security of the state based on
public decency, or morality, friendly relations with neighbors,
and a number of other let's turn to
our attention to article twenty it gives certain guarantees
to those who are accused of certain crimes
but it is similar to the concept of rule of law
there are three classes under article twenty
they deal withex post facto or retrospective application of laws
and there's another class which talks about protection from double jeopardy
and the third clause, deals with right to be free from self incrimination
they guaranteea range of rights, including right to equality,
abolition of untouchability and also six essential freedoms
in fact, in the next class, or next module, we will take up
the remaining articles of chapter three
starting from article twenty-one to article thirty-two
the dharma bound, even the king
thank you
if you see the dharamashashtras
it did speak about independence of judiciary,
and these decisions of the judiciary were supposed to bind even the king
, these were the ancient indian ethos and traditions
students welcome to week one, module two
which upheld a number of rights
but during the british period, if you see the indian citizens did not
enjoy equal rights and they were discriminated
according to the celebrated historian ramachandra guha
there were four conditions, which really
influenced the chapter on fundamental rights in the indian constitution
one was that during the british rule,
there was a denial of civil liberty to all indians
secondly, there were deplorable social conditions,
we take up human rights provisions in the indian constitution
particularly the treatment of so called untouchables and women,
which is needed to be remedied through the constitution
religious, linguistic ethnic minorities,
which were divided and exploited by the british
during their over two hundred years rule
and, lastly, there were exploitation of
tenants by the landlords all of these had influenced or shaped
the minds of our constitution framers
the part three of the constitution,
in fact, in this module we will cover article fourteen
which deals with fundamental rights, is in a way
enshrines a number of important rights
the deal with right to equality,certain freedoms,
right to life and personal liberty and so on and so forth
in fact, the legislature and the executive
cannot modify these fundamental rights guarantees in a big way
in fact, they have only a limited role there
after thepronunciation of basic structure doctrine,
by the supreme court of india, according to which a number of
rights under chapter three have been held,
dealing with right to equality and
to be a part of the basic structure and therefore cannot be
interfered with by the executive or the legislature
these in fact, find the pride of place in the constitutional scheme
and they are in a way different from the other legal rights under on a higher pedestal
let's come to the article fourteen dealing with right to equality
article fourteen is about every person within the territory of india
shall have right to equality before law, an equal protection of laws
in this sense it is also applicable to the non citizens as well
and it reflects it's a cause, the similar provision
in the universal declaration of human rights provided under article seven of udhr
till article twenty and article twenty-one to thirty-two will be covered in the next module
does right to equality mentioned in article fourteen
mean equal treatment uniform treatment to everyone?
no, it is not so in fact, if you know, we have had
centuries of caste discrimination in india,
and so two people who are at different stages of economic,
social and political development ,
it's not possible to regard everyone as equal
, therefore, the state could make
a reasonable classification of people
on certain grounds, and these have been upheld by the court
before we go further, let us understand that
and if you see the constitution scheme, there is a affirmative action
provided for women and persons belonging to scheduled caste and
scheduled tribes and also for persons who are socially
and economically backward sections of society
in fact, the courts really propounded the principle that
the equality is for those within a particular group
who are on equal circumstances
and in case people were in different circumstances,
they shall be treated with respect to the difference in their status
and as we have discussed, a reasonable classification
human rights are not alien to the indian culture, or ethos
between different people was needed
in fact, the supreme court has ruled that article fourteen
does not rule out classification for the purpose of legislation
in kedar nath bajoria vs the state of west bengal,
the supreme court held, i quote, the equal protection of laws
guaranteed by article fourteen of the constitution does not mean that
all laws must be general in character
and universal in application,
and that the state is no longer have the power of distinguishing
and classifying persons or things for the purpose of legislation unquote
if you see the buddhist tradition
in fact, the supreme court in their one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-two judgment,
state of west bengal versus anwar ali sarkar,
laid down the test for a valid classification
the supreme court noted that, for a classification to be valid,
two conditions must be fulfilled, namely, one the classification must be
founded on an intelligible differentia,
which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together
from others left out of the group and two the differentia
must have rational relation to the objects sought to be achieved by the
stature in question , in maneka gandhi versus union of india,
with exalted the non violence in thought, deed and action
music
is a part of right to life under article twenty-one
and the supreme court went on to say that
this right also includes protection of forests, lakes,
mountains, flora and fauna and protection from
air pollution, noise pollution, water pollution, and other
and also the maintenance of ecological balance
and sustainable development
the supreme court of india also
recently in the last year in two thousand and eighteen held that
right to privacy is also a part of article twenty-one dealing with
right to life and personal liberty, right against the exploitation
right to life for a long years, there was a dispute,
whether right to privacy was indeed
a fundamental right or not and that was laid to rest
in case puttaswamy versus union of india,
and navtej singh case versus union of india
and in the case puttaswamy's case, the supreme court held that
right to privacy is very much a part of article twenty-one
dealing with right to life and personal liberty
and in navtej singh case the supreme court decriminalised consensual
same sex relations and holding that
and as well as right to religious freedom
right to privacy is a part of right to life and personal liberty
and in last year, if you see, there was one more landmark judgement,
where supreme court recognize that right to life also
includes right to die with the dignity
in other words it recognised passive euthanasia
or living will, by those who are terminally ill
now, let us turn our attention to rights against exploitation
article twenty-three of the constitution deals with
right to be free from trafficking or beggar or forced labour
while article twenty-four prohibits employment of children
and few other rights
under the age of fourteen years in hazardous occupations, like
factories or mines in m h hoskot v state of maharashtra,
the supreme court keeping in view the promise contained in
article thirty-nine of the directive principles of state policy
held that right to free legal aid is a important facet of right to life
under article twenty-one of the constitution
in the case of d k basu versus state of west bengal
and sheela barse versus state of maharashtra
the supreme court came down on custodial violence
and upheld the rights of detained person and accused persons
first, let us look at right to life and personal liberty
and through an interpretation of article twenty-one dealing with right to life
and in fact, in the case of d k basu
the supreme court gave detailed directions on medical treatment
and also other directives on the accused person
being informed of the charges or a relative be informed about the
where abouts of the accused person and also registered to be
maintained in the police station and these guidelines
of supposed to be displayed in all police stations across the country
in the bandhua mukti morcha case, the supreme court said that
the health of workers both men and women should be protected,
if you see the article twenty-one of the indian constitution
and also mentioned that the maternity relief
to main conditions of work and children should be freed from
any exploitative conditions
and there again, drawing on the guarantee of right to life
and personal liberty under the article twenty-one of the constitution
if you look at article twenty-five to twenty-eight
they deal with right to freedom of religion, in all its facets
in particular, right article twenty-one deals with the right to profess
and practice a religion and it is of course, subject to certain
restrictions based on morality, health and a public order and other
it says, no person shall be deprived of his life or
rights contained under part three of the constitution
articles twenty-nine and thirty deal with the rights of minority to conserve
their language, culture and also practice and in
particular it also <lp upholds the rights of minority educational
institutions to establish and administer them and with a view
to protecting their culture article thirty-two mentions that in case
of infringement of any of the fundamental rights contained
under chapter three, a citizen can take recourse to
constitutional guarantee and for the enforcement of the rights and
this is article thirty-two is also a fundamental right so
personal liberty, except in accordance with the procedure
therefore there is a constitutionally provided
judicial guarantee for the enforcement of rights
in conclusion, we have seen articles twenty-one to thirty-two
and, in particular, we have spent a lot of time on article twenty-one how that
has been creatively interpreted to read a number of non
enforceable provisions, like right to food, right to hell,
and right to education, and right to human conditions of work
right to livelihood and right to privacy
and as a part of the article twenty-one dealing with right to life
we have also seen rights against exploitation
established by law
provided under article twenty-three and twenty-four
and also right to freedom of religion provided under article twenty-five to twenty-eight
and also rights of minorities under article twenty-nine and thirty
and we have also seen the article thirty-two dealing
with the when there is an infringement of constitutionally
guaranteed rights, how it provides a remedy to any person
for knocking on the doors of supreme court or high courts </lp
thank you
this is an extremely important article, and
which has produced many other rights, in fact that the higher
dear students, welcome to mooc on human rights in india
judiciary, through judicial innovation, through judicial
creativity, have read many new rights under article twenty-one
in fact, in the early years of the
after the adoption of the indian constitution this
article was construed in a narrow way
for instance, in ak gopalan vs state of madras
it was held that if there is a law,
which is a valid law and which is passed by the parliament
and which is applicable to all the citizens
and that will be sufficient to
i thank you for your interest and
come under this article ep>
in fact, there has been a long development over the years
and this earlier narrow construction of article twenty-one
has given way to a more expansive interpretation
and due process was read into this article in maneka gandhi's case
and later on further cases and the procedure has to be
reasonable and not arbitrary and for now, let us turn our
attention to a number of other rights
which have been read into article twenty-one
if you see francis coralie mullin vs union territory of delhi
to learn about the human rights system in india
justice bhagwati expounded that the right to life doesn't mean
routine life, but all that goes with the to enjoy
a life with the dignity that includes
adequate nutrition, it includes clothing, shelter,
like opportunity to express one self freely, move about freely
mingling with others
this even in some other cases like maneka gandhi,
again, this was reiterated
let us see kharak singh's case, kharak singh case as well
the supreme court held that
dear students,
right to life doesn't mean merely animal existence, it goes much
beyond that right
let us see how some of the rights which are
mentioned in the directive principles under chapter four of
the constitution have been read into the part three
under article twenty-one
right to education, for instance,
in unnikrishnan vs state of andhra pradesh,
and later on mohini jain vs state of karnataka
the supreme court held that right to education is an important facet of
welcome to week one, module three
right to life and in subsequent years in two thousand and two
there was a constitutional amendment, which was brought about
incorporating article twenty-one -a enshrining right to education
under the, as a fundamental right
let's look at for instance, right to food there was a case of people's
union for civil liberties versus union of india
and this case, which laster for more than a decade,
the supreme court passed a series of
interium ordres upholding the right to food
and giving detailed directions on let's say,
in the last module, we covered certain provisions
various anti poverty programs,
various schemes for instance integrated child welfare scheme
antyodaya anna yojana and other schemes
and held that right to food is a part of right to life
giving force to the or giving a legislative recognition to the
right to food
similarly, right to health has also been
recognized as a part of article twenty-one
in a series of cases, including permanand katara,
dealing with fundamental rights
pashchim banga khet mazdoor samity
which talked about access to emergency medical services,
the supreme court held that right to help is also an important
facet of right to life
now, let us see the how article twenty-one
has interacted with the rights of arrested persons or accused persons
whose liberty has been detained
in hussainara khatoon (i) or the a common cause
which is non-governmental organizations,
the supreme court held that the accused persons
on part three of the indian constitution
have a right to speedy trial and which is also
a facet of right to life and
so there were the moment somebody is arrested
or deprived of his liberty,
he or she do not cease to be persons this to enjoy
the protection under the article twenty-one <ep
if you see there was an unimminent environmental activists,
m c mehta who moved a number of petitions
before the supreme court of india and the supreme court
held that right to clean environment
during this module, we will take up
there has been a certain evolutive take
off the supreme court on this point
the first case in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-two state of madras versus champakam dorairajan
dealt with this issue, the government had reserved certain number of seats
in college on the basis of religion and caste
, this was in conflict with article twenty-nine ( 2)
however, the government's argument was that
this was an effort to give effect to article forty-six
which provides the right to education for the weaker sections
the supreme court held that wherever there is a conflict
which have set down aspirational goals for the government
between part three and part four, part three would prevail
, that means that if there is a conflict between fundamental rights
and the directive principles, the fundamental rights would be given
more importance to and the fundamental rights
would proceed over the directive principles
music
in inray kerala education bill case, in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven
the supreme court came up with
a concept of harmonious construction between the fundamental rights
and the directive principles
within their own constitution
music
in this case, the supreme court a ruled
that there is no inherent conflict between
the directive principles and the fundamental rights
they are essentially complementary and supplementary to each other
, they must be read in such a way
that there is no conflict that is created
,even though the directive principles cannot override
the fundamental rights, the directive the fundamental rights,
must be read in the light of directive principles
the concept of these dsps was borrowed from the irish constitution
music
in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven in i c golaknath versus state of punjab
the supreme court held that the fundamental rights
cannot be overrided to give effect to the directive principles
music
however, the parliament in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one
came up with the twenty-five th amendment to the indian constitution
music
under the twenty-five th amendment, article thirty-one c was added to the constitution
there are two parts to article thirty-one (c),
now the director principles of state policies
the first part is that if there is a law that is created,
which gives effect to the directive principles laid down in thirty-nine b, or thirty-nine c
such a law cannot be called into question or cannot be held void
on the basis of violation of article fourteen article nineteen or article thirty-one
music
the second part of article thirty-one c stated that if there is any law
which mentions in its objectives that it is being promulgated,
to bring into effect the directive principles laid down in thirty-nine b and thirty-nine c
such a law is going to be beyond judicial scrutiny
music
are actually guidelines which are given to the government,
this amendment was challenged in the landmark judgement
of kesavanand bhari versus state of kerala in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three
the supreme court held that even though the parliament had the power
to amend any part of the indian constitution,
they could not interfere with the basic structure of the constitution
music
kesavanand bharti does not lay down completely
what the basic structure of the constitution is?
however, it stated that judicial review was
one of the important components of basic structure
both legislature and executive, which must be kept in mind
and since in the second part of article thirty-one c
judicial review, there was a complete ban on judicial review
for any law which is being brought in to give effect to the directive of principles
that part of article thirty-one c was struck down
the parliament struggle continued and in the forty-two nd amendment in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six
the purview of article thirty-one c was expanded
article thirty-one c, now read that any law which is promulgated to bring into effect,
not just the directive principles of thirty-nine b and c,
but any directive principle cannot be called into
question for violation of article one thousand, four hundred and nineteen and thirty-one
while formulating the laws and policies of the country
music
in the landmark judgment of minerva mills
the supreme court finally settled the conflict between
the fundamental rights and directive principles
music
in this particular case, the court held
that fundamental rights and directive principles are two
important components of the constitution
and must be read harmoniously with each other
article thirty-one c was also changed back to its pre one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six position
these principles lay down certain high ideas for justice,
, article thirty-one c as it reads now,
is that if there is any law, which is created
to bring into effect article thirty-nine b, or thirty-nine c
it cannot be held void, if it is in violation of article one thousand, four hundred and nineteen or thirty-one
so it cannot be held void for the reason of violating article one thousand, four hundred and nineteen or thirty-one
minerva mills settle the conflict to a large extent between
fundamental rights and directive principles,
by holding that both need to be read together
and there needs to be a harmonious outlook towards them
over the years the government has been able to
political, social and economic equality
bring to effect some of the directive principles
for example, the government has promoted the creation of village panchayats
and now there are over two lakh village panchayats in the country
also under article forty-seven which provides for
an increase in the standard of living
the government has rolled out several schemes
like the integrated rural development program
and the integrated tribal development program
to provide nutritional value to the people living under the poverty line
also, an article thirty-nine a right to work has been
and fraternity amongst the community
hello students and welcome to the mooc on human rights in india
recognized as an important directive principle
this has also been recognized as part of right to life
by the supreme court in the olga tellis case
in the eighty-six th amendment in two thousand and two
article forty-five which deals with right to education has been recognized
as an as part of right to live under article twenty-one a,
which now ensures elementary education to all children
so to sum up the directive principles or guidelines,
which are provided to the government for the creation of a welfare state
even though they are non justiciable, they have been recognized
they range from principles like distribution of wealth,
by the supreme court as important tools
for interpreting not just statutes, but also the fundamental rights
the relationship and the conflict between the fundamental rights
and the directive principles has been resolved
in a manner in which both will be seen and read harmoniously together,
and neither can be given precedence over the other
over the years the government has been able to fulfill
some of the provisions which have been laid down in the directive principles,
but we have a long way to go in front of us
thank you
providing living wage to the people,
music
right to work right to education, maternity benefits,
protection of environment and protection of the architectural heritage of india
now, even though there are these high
ideas prescribed in the directive principles,
they are none justiciable in a court of law
what this means is, a person cannot approach a court of law
to enforce the principles which are laid down in part four
music
today, we are going to discuss the module on directive
also, if there is a law that is in violation of a directive principle
just because of the fact that is in violation of the directive principle
it cannot be held to be void
music
so there is very little legal force behind these principles
music
at the time of framing of the constitution
the members of the constituent assembly were faced with a dilemma
there were certain rights, both civil and political,
and economic and social, which were taken to be protected
principles of state policies
there was a commitment to protect these rights
however, given that india was going to be a newly independent country,
and would have to face poverty and lack of resources,
certain principles, which were aspirational in a sense of
building a welfare state but which probably could not have been
provided at the very onset they were laid down in the directive principles
there was a particular thought process
that went into the idea of making these guidelines,
though,giving them as a direction to the future governments
but not making them enforceable in a court of law
music
some critics believe that the director of principles
are merely pious expressions and don't have any force of law
the eminent members of the constituent assembly, like sir benegal rau
believed that they were in fact educated measures
which could provide a certain direction for the development of the country
the objective was to develop india as a welfare state
in a welfare state, it is the responsibility of the state
to ensure health and other certain benefits to the citizens
specially to those members who are financially
or have a socially weaker section of the society
the directive principles of state policies,
hence, the directive principles have been framed in such away
dr ambedkar believe that even though there isn't a legal force behind them,
there is definitely a political sanction or a political justice ability
that means that the director of principles can be seen as guidelines,
which the electorate could keep in mind,
while judging whether a certain government
or a certain political party should be voted in power again
these are the guidelines through which the progress of a government can be checked
also, according to dr ambedkar,
the directive principles were very similar to the instrument of instructions,
or dpsp are enshrined in part four of the constitution under article thirty-six to fifty-one
which are given to the governor general and to the various governors in india
under the government of india act of one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-five
, even though they are non justiciable,
an important feature of the directive principles
as recognized by the courts is that
they are useful in the interpretation of various statutes
so the any statute must be interpreted in such a way
that there is no conflict between the statute and the directive principles
over the years, the courts have also come to recognize
that the directive principles help in understanding
music
the scope of fundamental rights as well
,the relationship between fundamental rights and directive principles
is an important topic of discussion
fundamental rights are negative liabilities that are put on the state
, for example, these are guidelines
or these are instructions to the state of things which should not be done
for example, the state shall not discriminate between people
the state shall not interfere with the life and liberty of a person
on the other hand, the directive principles are positive obligations
that have been put on the state
the dpsp are truly novel feature of the indian constitution,
for example, these are the measures like
providing the right to work or providing maternity benefits
which have to be given by the government
for a person to be able to enjoy the right
, of course, fundamental rights are enforceable in a court of law
and as we just discussed, dpsp's are not enforceable in a court of law
, now the question arises,
what happens when the fundamental rights
come in conflict with the directive principles?
this issue has come before the supreme court as early as the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty s
as there are very few countries around the world,
article thirteen of the constitution provides
that if there is any law that is formed,
which is in violation of a fundamental right, such a law would be void
hence, we see that the indian constitution has made
the fundamental rights, which give recognition to international human rights
justice civil enforceable through courts of law
music
apart from the fundamental rights
some of the economic, social and cultural rights find recognition
within the directive principles of state policy
different sovereign states, as well as certain customary laws
enshrined in part four of the constitution
even though directive principles of state policies
are not justiceible through courts
they are to act as guidelines for the state
at the time of exercising executive or legislative power
the indian judiciary has also recognized
that the directive principles are an important tool of
interpretation while interpreting various statutes,
including the scope of fundamental rights
hence, some of the directorate principles have actually found
which are essential universally recognized principles, which all states follow
recognition under the wider ambit of article twenty-one
which is right to life , let's discuss the relationship
between universal declaration of human rights and the indian constitution
at the time of drafting of the indian constitution in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-nine
the udhr had just come into existence in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-eight
the framers of the indian constitution were greatly influenced
by the universal declaration of human rights and tried to incorporate,
the principles in the indian constitution as well, some of the
principles of udhr like equality before law
which is laid down in article seven of udhr finds recognition in article fourteen
the history of eu international human rights
of the indian constitution provision from discrimination
which is again part of article seven of udhr finds recognition
in article fifteen of the new constitution, right to freedom of speech and expression
which is in article nineteen of udhr finds
recognition in article nineteen ( one (a)) of the indian constitution
and right protection of life and liberty
which is an article nine of udhr finds mentioned
in article twenty-one of the indian constitution
in keshavanand bharti case, the supreme court held
that even though udhr is not a binding principle,
can be traced back to the thirteen th century
it is important to note that this was the nature of human rights
that was recognized and accepted at the time,
when the indian constitution came into existence
hence, udhr is an important rule of interpretation and cannot be ignored
in another case, chairman of railway board vs chandrima das
it was held that the udhr is the universally recognized moral code of conduct
and hence cannot be ignored by them hence even though udhr does not
create any legally binding obligations on the state
the indian judiciary has used it as an important interpretation tool,
and hence cannot be ignored
when magna carta was created to act as a limitation on the english royal government
music
next, let's discuss the international covenant on
civil and political rights and the indian constitution
music
similar to the udhr, there are certain provisions of the iccpr,
which are also found in the indian constitution
for example, article eight of iccpr talks about prohibition of forced labour
which can be found in article twenty-three of the indian constitution
article twenty-five of iccpr talks about equality of opportunity
which can be found in article sixteen of the indian constitution
after this, in one thousand, seven hundred and seventy-six at the time of independence,
article twenty-one of iccpr talks about freedom of peaceful assembly
which can be found in article nineteen ( 1) b of the indian constitution,
article twenty-three of iccpr talks about freedom of association,
which can be found in nineteen ( one (c)) of the indian constitution
music
apart from the rights which have been laid down
as part of fundamental rights the fascinating part of this discussion
is that the indian courts have used international covenants
to give effect to certain enumerated rights
in the indian constitution and make them a part of article twenty-one
declaration of independence of america,
as a part of right to life although in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight in the controversial decision
of adm jabalpur vs shivkant shukla, the supreme court
had held that the indian constitution does not recognize
any common law rights apart from those that are expressly
provided in the indian constitution
this trend has gradually changed
from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty s onwards with the advent of public interest litigation,
several rights have come under the ambit of article twenty-one
music
for example, article seventeen of iccpr provides for right to privacy
the american bill of rights was created
this rights states that a person's privacy
his family's privacy would not be interfered to an unreasonable extent
such a right is not provided in the indian constitution
in the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four judgment of kharak singh versus state of uttar pradesh,
supreme court held that even though
right to privacy is not guaranteed under the constitution
article twenty-one acts as a repository of the rights,
which are not mentioned in the constitution,
and hence recognize the common law right to privacy
music
the indian fundamental rights have borrowed
in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven in pucl versus union of india
supreme court held that this privacy extended
to phone conversation and hence phone tapping is also violative of article twenty-one
music
finally, in k s puttaswamy versus union of india
landmark judgment in two thousand and seventeen the supreme court acknowledged
that right to privacy is protected under the constitutional
guarantees of article one thousand, four hundred and nineteen and twenty-one the right to travel abroad
is also another right which is not mentioned in the indian constitution
music
greatly from the american bill of rights
welcome students to the mooc on human rights in india
article twelve of iccpr provides the right to travel
however, the indian supreme court in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven
in satwant singh versus assistant passport officer in new delhi
held that the right to travel is a part of article twenty-one to the part of right to life
the same was reiterated in maneka gandhi versus union of india
the right to speedy trial, right to speedy trial is recognized
under article nine of iccpr however, there is no mention of
specifically or right with respect to speedy trial in the indian constitution
iccpr provides that any person who was arrested or detained
shall be brought before a judge and shall be entitled
in one thousand, seven hundred and eighty-nine during the french revolution,
to a trial within a reasonable period of time or to release
the indian supreme court in hussainara kahtoon case
held that right to speedy trial is part of fair
and just procedure, and hence part of article twenty-one
article fourteen of iccpr provides for the right to free legal assistance
music
article fourteen of iccpr provides that any person who's undergoing
a criminal trial shall be entitled to legal assistance
and shall be informed of his rights that if such legal assistance is not
available to him the same shall be provided by the state
certain important ideas gained acceptance in the community,
music
a similar right does not find mentioned in the indian constitution
however, in m h hoskot versus state of maharashtra
the supreme court held that the right to free legal assistance
is implicit in article twenty-one as it is an important component of fair and just procedure
lastly, article nineteen of iccpr provides for
the right to freedom of speech and expression, including the right to information
article nineteen ( one (a)) of the indian constitution,
as well provides the right to freedom of speech and expression
however, the same does not extend to right to information
and they have now formed the foundations of modern human rights law
music
in the landmark judgment of sp gupta versus union of india
the supreme court held that the right to
information is an essential tenet, essential part of our
democratic government and hence, the disclosures related to
government function should be the rule and secrecy should be an exception
thereby guaranteeing right to information as part of the indian constitution
from this discussion, we can see that the rights
which are laid down in iccpr have either been recognized
and laid down in the indian constitution as fundamental rights
these ideas were first, liberty, also known as liberty or freedoms
or have been recognized by the indian judiciary as being part of the
wider ambit of right to life under article twenty-one
music
next, we move on to the international covenant
on social economic and cultural rights or the icescr
icescr was ratified by india in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six
and thereby, india consented to be bound by the shape
and interesting feature of icescr
is that the signatories states are under an obligation to promote
and respect the rights that are laid down in the covenant
these income past civil and political rights are the first generation rights
however, they are not bound legally to provide for the same
music
these rights i mentioned in part four of the indian constitution
under directive principles of state policy
just like directive principles of state policy
these are not justicible in court
they are not enforceable through a court of law
however, the indian judiciary has found ways to include them in interpretation
of other fundamental rights, especially article twenty-one
, let's discuss some of the provisions of icscr
second, egalite or equality which can be achieved
and their parallels in the indian constitution
article seven of icescr provides for equal pay for equal work
the same is recognized under article thirty-nine a
of the indian constitution as a director of principle on equal pay for equal work
in randhir singh's case the supreme court held
that even though the principle of equal pay for equal work
is not part of a fundamental right
still, as being a constitutional goal, it is enforceable through the courts mechanism
article seven and twelve of the icescr
provide for certain medical benefits to be provided to work
by the realization of social economic rights
when and for the provision of healthy working conditions
the same fine recognition in article thirty-eight and thirty-nine of the indian constitution
music
the supreme court in regional director esi versus francis de costa,
held that the provision of medical and disability benefits
to the wokkman is part of fundamental rights under article twenty-one
article six of the icescr provides for the right livelihood
with states that every person shall have the right
to engage in livelihood which he freely chooses
and accepts ,right to livelihood is recognized in the indian constitution
these are also known as the second generation rights
as part the director of principles and has
also been recognized by the supreme court of india
as part of a fundamental right and the right to life article twenty-one
in the case of olga telus versus bombay municipal cooperation,
right to shelter is recognized under article seven of icescr
and the same has found recognition in the indian constitution
as well as through the indian judiciary in the case of chameli singh
chameli singh's case supreme court held that right to
life includes the right to food,right to water, right to decent environment,
and right to shelter the supreme court expanded on the concept of shelter
third, fraternity, or fraternity these are collective rights
to include safe and decent living structure
clean sorrounding and civil amenities like electricity and water supply
music
and we see that even though the principles
which are laid down in icescr are mostly found
in direct principles of state policy in the indian constitution
which are not justiceable in on their own still, the supreme court has found ways
to include and give force to these principles through enlarging
the ambit of article twenty-one in the end, i would like to conclude
by saying that the international bill of human rights
which as a community can be exercised and recognized
today, we are going to discuss
which is the udhr, iccpr, and icescr have found recognition
under the indian constitution as various fundamental rights
as well as director of principles of state policy
even the unnumbered rights which are not specifically laid down
in the indian constitution have now been included
into the constitutional regime of human rights through the supreme court decisions
these decisions were possible taking cue from the international covenants
and from the declaration to give effect to the international principles
by which india has found itself by ratifying these conventions
thank you
these are now known as the third generation rights
music
music
in one thousand, nine hundred and nineteen international labor law organization was formed
which was one of the first international
organizations with respect to human rights
the international labor organization focused on the
human rights standards of the rights of workmen
this was part of the peace treaty of ourselves
music
after the first world war, league of nations was formed with an aim to ensure
the module on international human rights law and the indian constitution
that such a war does not take place again through international corporation
however, the efforts of bringing the international community together
under the ages of human rights, and also providing an effective remedy
to those whose rights have been violated was not successful
through the league of nations
this led to the second world war
after which the united nations was formed in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-five
and the united nations charter was adopted in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-five
it can be said that united nations came into existence to save the
future generations from the scourge of wars
international human rights law is part of the larger discipline of international law
like the first world war and the second world war
article one of the united nations charter lays down
as one of the important goals of un to promote and encourage
the respect of human rights without any distinction of race, sex,
caste, creed, language or religion the language of human rights
first found recognition in the covenants of league of nations
at the time of drafting of the united nations charter
it was discussed that "declaration on the essential rights of man"
should be added into the charter
however, this required a longer deliberation
music
which was not possible at that particular meeting
hence, in the first session in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-seven
it was discussed that a preliminary bill on
international human rights would be drafted
the drafting was later given to a commission of eight states
these states were chosen to ensure maximum participation across
the international community, keeping in mind the geographical locations
the international bill of human rights comprises of three documents
the first is the universal declaration of human rights udhr
which was adopted in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-eight the second is
international human rights law promotes the development of
the international covenant of civil and political rights or the iccpr
which was ratified in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six the third is
the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights, or the icescr
which was also ratified in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six after most of the states
became signatories to it, at the time of drafting of
the international bill of human rights, it was discussed
that two documents shall be created
one in the form of a declaration
which would lay down the standards of human rights across the international community
and second, in the form of a covenant, which would lay down
human rights across social, regional and domestic levels
specific rights and limitations
which would be legally binding
on the states that became signatories to it
however, at the time of drafting of the covenants
there was a split between the international community as some favor to civil
and political rights and some favored economic and social rights
because of this, the covenant was divided into two parts
and hence now we have iccpr which focuses on civil and political rights
and icescr, which focuses on economic, social and cultural rights
now let's discuss the indian constitution and the human rights
the binding effect of international human rights law
which have been recognized under the indian constitution
there are several rights which are laid down in udhr, or iccpr
and icscr, which find recognition in the indian constitution
the in alienable rights, which are also known as
the fundamental rights are enshrined and part three of the constitution
these rights are couched in a negative language,
which ensures that certain instructions are given to the state
they are to act as a limitation on the power of the state
with respect to executive and legislative functions,
and hence violations of the fundamental rights are to be avoided by the state
comes from the various treaties that have been signed between
the requirement of locus standi,
thereby enabling a public spirited
music
group to bring forward a case concerning public interest
music
there was another case where
three ministers of government of maharashtra sold
music
land at lower rates to some person
music
for instance, the three wings of the state, namely the legislature,
pillow modi complaint against government of maharashtra
in this matter before a court of law,
and the respondents claimed that pillow modi
did not have locus standi in this matter,
but the court, the judge rejected the contention altogether
see here is a case involving corruption free administration
here is a matter involving public interest at large
and the having regard to these issues
the court rejected the contention of the respondents
that pillow modi did not have locus standi
the executive, the judiciary have their respective roles
in fact, the supreme court has been very careful not to enlarge
this relaxation of locus standi to criminal matters, or service matters
in fact, in one such matter,
there was in what is regard called
panchhi versus state of uttar pradesh
music
there was a case involving death sentence to a woman
the supreme court rejected the intervention of
even a statutory body like the national commission for women
so in other words, in certain matters,
for the protection and promotion of human rights
the traditional rule of locus standi was relaxed, but
this did not apply to the criminal matters or service matters
the supreme court gave guidelines clearly mentioning that
pil cannot be maintained by middle some interlopers,
busybodies, wayfarers and those who have no public interests
and those who file only purely for personal gain or publicity
another important characteristic of pil is what can be called as
a letter petitions the technical term for it is epistolary jurisdiction
in simple terms, it means
music
and the civil society also contributes to this effort
anybody can approach the supreme court
through a postcard or a letter or a telegram
in fact, these days telegram is not in vogue, but
about three decades back telegram was used to draw
attention to urgent matters
music
in fact,
music
access to courts is an important issue
and often it is said that there is a class bias
we have also seen the human rights provisions
and only a rich people can affort the best of the lawyers
and in terms of filing etc there is a huge transactional costs,
but when you accept
music
a matter relating to public importance,
through a postcard or a letter or a telegram,
it opens floodgates, it opens access
to justice for the poor or marginalized persons
there are many examples in this letter petitions
for instance, s p gupta versus union of india case or a judge's case
in the constitution of india under part three
sunil batra relating to the prisoners rights,
music
sheela barse and d k basu, both have brought
music
to the attention of the supreme court,
the custodial violence and custodial deaths and those
letters were in fact treated as are converted into a public
interest petition and thereafter, the court gave a
series of important directions
music
dealing with fundamental rights and part four dealing with
in fact, in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight the supreme court issued a notification
on what kind of petitions will not be entertainable
the supreme court said issues relating to bonded labour,
neglected children or petitions seg sent by prisoners
or atrocities on women, children shedule caste,
shedule tribes etc will be entertainable as pil
on the other hand,
landlord-tenant disputes,
music
service matters,
music
music
admission to medical colleges or other educational institutions
will not be entertained as pil
music
the other important characteristic of pil is that it is a done in a
non-adversarial manner here there are no
contending parties
traditional mode, there are lawyers who argued the case on either side
and the judge decides either for or against a party
in the public interest litigation,
directive principles of state policy
all of them are working towards a particular cause for
resolution of a issue relating to public interest at large
so here, the courts, the lawyers, the judges, they all work in tandem
to find or resolve issue which is of great, immense public interest
and the purpose of this non adversarial mode is
to make human rights meaningful to
the persons belonging to marginalized or vulnerable communities
music
another important characteristic of pil is
the appointment of a pil petitioner or amicus curiae
let us take up how judiciary enforces these fundamental rights
dear students,
here the supreme court appoints a person
often is a senior advocate of the court
as a amicus curiae to aid the matter
and here the person becomes public interest litigation petitioner
or he or she doesn't have any stake in the matter,
but they assist the court in the resolution of the issue
they present all facts and circumstances
music
let me give you an example
music
what is public interest litigation all about ?
there was a case filed by extra judicial execution victims families
it's a manipur based non governmental organization
it's an organization of widows whose husbands had been killed
and it is in short, it's called eefam versus union of india
here the supreme court
music
appointed a senior counsel, maneka guruswamy
as an amicus curiae to assist the court
in getting to the bottom of the complaint of
which involves about one thousand, five hundred
how is it defined ?
deaths in encounters or extrajudicial executions
now,
music
there is one other important element relating to the pil
that is that our appointment of commissions or commissioners,
here, the supreme court appoints
music
some eminent persons be civil servants, journalists, academics
or others to assist the court in investigating the matter,
and where there is sufficient information is not available
what is the purpose of pil ?
to the court for instance, moved by the
starvation deaths in some pockets of the country
the people's union for civil liberties,
moved a public interest petition before the supreme court of india,
in what is known as right to food case
here, the court appointed a former civil servant,
mr nc saxena as a commissioner to assist it
subsequently, mr harshmander was also appointed as a commissioner
to give the details there was a case brought
to the attention of the supreme court by sheela barse
what are its unique characteristics ?
about the custodial violence
faced by the woman undertrial prisoners in maharashtra
in that case, the court appointed armaiti desai was who was a
known social worker reputed social worker
to go deep into the issue and place relevant information
before the supreme court
music
there was a case involving indian council for
enviro legal action,
which is a non governmental organization versus union of india,
music
this case related to the groundwater or soil pollution
in this case, the supreme court appointed nagpur based
national environmental engineering research institute
to assistant and monitor the issue and submit reports to it
in conclusion, public interest litigation
has contributed a great deal to social change
it has helped prisoners
who have been languishing for long periods of time
and people who are living in subhuman conditions in mental hospitals,
women remand homes, or children in hazardous occupations or factories
and how does it differ from the traditional methods
there were a series of innovative
steps that have been taken one was judicial monitoring of
institutions and also fashioning a new regime of human rights,
democratizing access to justice, fashioning new kinds of relief,
and also in many-many other aspects, so pil has contributed
immensely to gender justice, environmental justice and also
bonded labour and many other important areas
there are, a few drawbacks
some people have filed petitions
music
in fact, pil can be regarded as a tool
and the for publicity and or for
sometimes corporate interests try to masquerade as public
interest and corporates wanted to settle battles among
themselves through the pil
in such cases, the court frowned upon such practices
and often imposed huge costs on the petitioners
at the whole, pil has been a great revolution
and a great in the annals of the indian judicial history
and in the coming modules we will see in greater detail
pil's contribution in individually areas
which has been crafted by
music
music
judiciary,
the mooc on human rights in india, week three we take up
music
through judicial creativity, through judicial innovation
and public interest litigation as the word litigation connotes,
it's a kind of a action before a court of law
to further general interest or common interests or public interests
pil can be defined as a kind of constitutional adjudication
in pursuit of constitutional justice
promoting the concept of a welfare state
music
and the purpose of pil is access to justice
today introduction to public interest litigation
in fact there are people who on account of their poverty,
illiteracy or other reasons, are unable to access the courts
for
music
securing a remedy for the wrongs that they have suffered
and in fact pil can be regarded as a strategy of the legal aid
movement to bring justice,
music
close or within the reach of those
were unable to access judicial mechanisms for the redress of their
music
music
violations
what are the unique characteristics of public interest litigation
students, let us now turn our attention to the unique characteristics of
public interest litigation and also see
how it differs from the traditional modes of dispute resolution
in fact, four important characteristics can be shown as a
unique characteristics of pil
number one relaxation of procedural requirements
appointment of commission's or commissioners by the court
as we have earlier seen
music
pil petitioners or appointment of amicus curiae
and fourth,
music
the whole thing is conducted in a non adversarial manner
music
we will see each of these aspects in greater detail
for instance, first let us take up the relaxation of the
procedural requirements
the traditional rule is that only a person who is affected
music
can approach a court of law whenever his or her constitutionally
guaranteed fundamental rights are infringed
with the request for a remedy
in what can be regarded as a truly a judicial revolution
cases involving grievances and concerns of
public at large can also be brought to the attention of the court
by a non governmental organization or by a civil society group
or any person
so in other words,
music
there is national human rights protection system
the traditional mode,
it was a only an affected individual could approach
music
the court of law
music
whenever his or her rights are infringed
human_rights_in_india_5815
music
somebody can agitate before the court
relating to causes where public interest is a stake
music
the supreme court also relaxed what is known as locus standi
music
what is meant by locus standi ?
locus standi means a person, whose
music
rights are violated can alone approach the court of law
in a landmark case called
municipal council of ratlam versus vardhichand and others
justice krishna iyer relaxed
music
with responsibilities of different organs laid down
it has affected the hydrological balance
and the court said it's very important to ensure that
people have a right to
music
live in a clean environment and particularly,
their cattle, their home, their lands shall not be affected by
pollution of air, water and other pollution
it has ordered the closure of these illegal limestone quarries
in the case of godavarman thirumalpad versus union of india,
the court came down heavily on the certain companies and the state
music
for neglecting its duties under the constitution of india
it has asked the government of himachal pradesh
to pay a sum of rupees one crore as fine for allowing painting
by certain companies of advertisements on the fragile rock faces
on the way from rohtang to manali
so, the court
music
said the no this is not permissible,
the protection of environment is extremely important
and it has also ordered
article twenty-one of the constitution of india,
the companies whose advertisements were displayed to pay one crore each
and create a corpus of a sum of rupees five crore,
which shall be used to restore the ecology that was damaged by
painting of the rock faces by through these advertisements
music
in the case of andhra pradesh pollution control board versus m v naidu
the supreme court held that
music
a citizen has a right to clean drinking water
and it held that this right is a part of the article twenty-one dealing with
how it has been expanded by the courts
right to life
in fact, the court said the access to clean drinking water
in sufficient quality and quantity shall be provided
as a part of the basic needs of a citizen
let us turn our attention to the water pollution
m c mehta, one of the
music
ardent environmental activists has moved several cases
to the supreme court of india
in one such case, he drew the attention of the court
in fact, article twenty-one says, no person shall be
to the operation of certain tanneries which were leaving
pollutants in the river ganga and costing and environmental damage,
and the court
music
asked these tanneries to install sewage treatment plants
music
and treat the water before discharging it into the river ganga
and the court said
music
the financial capacity of the tanneries is totally irrelevant,
deprived of his life and personal liberty except
and they have a duty to ensure that they do not discharge
polluted, untreated water into the river ganges
as a result of this order many polluting tanneries were
closed m c mehta has also filed
a public interest litigation regarding the damage caused to taj mahal
as result of atmospheric pollution
he mentioned that the refineries that were operating in mathura
and the industries that were operating in the neighboring areas,
were releasing sulfur dioxide fumes into the air and
which was affecting the taj mahal as you know, taj is a
in accordance with the procedure established by law
world heritage monument
it's a part of our cultural heritage
and the supreme court having regard to the gravity of the issue,
issue directions asking the coal based and cope based industries
in the what is called taj trapezium zone to
either switch to natural gas or relocate in another area
as per the agra master plan
the supreme court also asked the union of india and the state government
to release funds for maintenance of trees and
plants in and around taj mahal
so this article twenty-one dealing with the right to life and personal liberty
music
in another case, kerala sastra sahitya parishad,
which is a non governmental organization filed a pil
music
regarding the environmental damage that is proposed to be caused by
a silent valley project
and the petitioner mentioned that
no proper environmental impact assessment was done
as a result of this case eventually,
the government abandoned the silent valley project
has been interpreted or has been expanded by the supreme court
let me turn your attention to another important case
called bichhri village case or hitch acid case
here, a non governmental organization called indian council for
enviro legal action,
filed a pil before the supreme court of india,
drawing its attention to a certain chemical industries, which are operating
in a village called bichhri near udaipur and they were releasing
highly toxic materials and which was damaging the
groundwater, the land and it was causing
enormous environmental damage
to include the right to health and right to pollution free environment
now, having regard to this the
supreme court asked national environmental engineering research institute
or neeri to ascertain facts on the ground
and they neeri said neeri confirm about the damage
cause to the environment and how these industries
did not take proper approvals from the statutory authorities
did not obtain proper license, but we're operating
in the village and were destroying the environment
so the court order remedial measures to stop
a prevention of water pollution
in the international efforts towards
dear students,
and other pollution caused by the operation of these chemical industries
the supreme court also entertained a number of public interest litigation
with regard to the smoking in public places
or air pollution in delhi in one case what is called the
oleum gas leak case which is a very significant one
it there was the sri ram food and fertilizers
was operating a highly hazardous industry in the delhi
and there was a release of oleum gas and which affected
a lot of people living in the neighboring vicinity
and in this case, the supreme court said
protection of environment and sustainable development,
any enterprise which is operating in highly hazardous chemicals
and the release of which affected the civilian population,
and that enterprise is absolutely liable
to compensate people affected by the
such a gas leak and this kind, this absolute liablity
does not allow for any exceptions whatsoever
music
you all know, the bhopal gas disaster, which occurred on december three rd of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four
where over three thousands people perished,
and nearly two hundred thousand people were injured
stockholm conference or stockholm declaration
when highly lethal methyl isocyanate was know
leaked from union carbide factory
and again here, the supreme court of india
mediated a settlement and ordered
four hundred and seventy million dollars
for the victims to settle past, present and future claims
and here, the supreme court invoke the extra ordinary jurisdiction
and the supreme court sighting the enormity of the
human tragedy and human suffering underlying the need for
dispersal of immediate and substantial relief to the victims
that was adopted in the year one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two is a major milestone
students in this module,
we have seen the constitutional provisions,
the legislative provisions with regard to the protection
and improvement of natural environment
we have also seen how ngos and public spirited citizens
have moved the supreme court and other high courts
with a view to honor a range of matters
with a view to protect environment
and so that way the public interest litigation
has contributed in a very significant manner
it asked all states to adopt legislative measures
to the evolution of environmental jurisprudence
in the country
thank you
and see you in the next module
music
to protect environment
in pursuance india also has amended the constitution of india
in fact article forty-eight a was inserted in the chapter dealing
with the directive principles of state policy
if you look at the article forty-eight a,
it asks the state to protect and improve
welcome to mooc on human rights in india
natural environment including forests, and wildlife
music
so here is a obligation cast on the state,
while framing legislations to keep article forty-eight a in view
and prepare legislations accordingly
music
while article forty-eight a cast obligation on the state
there is a similar duty cast on the citizens through
an amendment in the
article dealing with the fundamental duties of citizens
over the course of this module and the next module,
under article fifty-one a in fact, a clause (g) was inserted in article fifty-one a
requiring every citizen imposing a duty on every citizen
to protect environment and improve environment, including forests,
wildlife, rivers, lakes etc
so these are in some list of constitutional provisions or goals
relating to protection of environment
a number of legislations were also adopted by the parliament
for instance there was a water prevention and control of pollution act
was adopted in the year, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four
it was supplemented by a water cess act a few years later
we will see public interest litigation and environment in detail
and in the same way there was an air
prevention and control of pollution act was adopted in the year one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one
and environmental protection act of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six is an important landmark
legislation in this regard
and there was a wildlife protection act,
forest conservation act and national green tribunal acts
were adopted by the parliament
there are more legislations
that were adopted to deal with the issue of protection
and improvement of environment
we have earlier seen the introduction to public interest litigation
these have been complemented by a number of policies that were adopted
dealing with let's say national water policy, or the use of batteries
or plastic waste or hazardous materials
and their disposal, construction debri, and many other aspects
having seen the constitutional provisions
the various legislations and policies,
let us now turn our attention to the important cases
adjudicated by the supreme court of india and the other higher courts
music
for instance, in ratlam municipality versus vardhichand
and its contribution in other areas
the supreme court relaxed or extended the scope of locus standi
in the case of environmental matters
the traditional rule of locus standi requires that
only an affected person whose right has been infringed,
can move the court of law and seek a remedy
so the court said in matters concerning protection of basic environment,
natural environment there could be petitions from
public spirited citizens
so in this particular case, the court ordered the ratlam municipality
to provide sanitation and drainage
the protection and improvement of natural environment
music
and it rejected the argument advanced by the
ratlam municipality of resources or lack of resources
and said it had a duty to protect the public health and
discharge the right to clean environment
this case is very significant in the sense that
it opened a silent legal revolution
and led to a number of many other matters coming to the
supreme court and other high courts regarding environment
let's see another interesting case,
is one of the key areas for the public interest litigation
music
which was filed by rural litigation, entitlement kendra or rlek
against the government of uttar pradesh
in fact, it was started as letter petition to the supreme court
and the supreme court treated as a writ petition
the issue involved is about illegal limestone quarries
operating in the hills near mussooire and dehradun
and the operation of these illegal limestone quarries
has affected the natural environment
it has affected the fragile ecosystem
in fact, we have already seen
music
there have been many other cases
music
which went to the supreme court and using this precautionary principle,
the court
music
gave directions about noise pollution
by in the process of construction of multi storied buildings
in chennai or the environmental damage caused by
shrimp culture or aquaculture
second aspect of the pil and the environment
in the coastal zones
having considered the precautionary principles,
let us turn our attention to the
second principle relating to polluter pays
music
in other words,
music
in the international environmental law,
there is a principle which lays down that
the polluter has the liability to pay for the damage
in the last module we saw how a number of matters
caused to the environment in the last module, we saw the
bichhri village case where a non governmental organization namely
the indian council for enviro legal action, filed a case
against union of india about the operation of a
music
firm near udaipur
which is you know involved in hazardous chemicals,
and it was damaging the groundwater,
it was damaging the soil
and in this case, again, the supreme court endorsed the
came before the supreme court and other high courts
polluter pays principle and held that
the absolute liability of the firm
that is operating the particular concern and which is polluting
the environment must compensate all individuals who have been
affected by the damage to the environment
and the court also held that the absolute liability of that firm
also extends to the remediation of the damaged environment
in other words, the court must compensate the individuals affected
but also ensure the environment
must be restored to the previous position,
regarding environmental issues
which was there before its operation
here, it's very important to note that there are two aspects
one is prevention of damage to the environment and
second is the remediation of damage to the environment
there are two aspects involved here,
one is, efforts to prevent damage to the environment
and second is remediation of damaged environment
the court held that cost should not be passed on to the government
and it's not the government that has to take
these efforts and which the court said will become a liability
we will see in this module, what kind of principles,
of the taxpayer and the court in fact held that the form that is
damaging the natural environment is liable or as absolutely liable
for payment of the costs to the villagers who have been affected
by its operations and also for restoration
remediation of environment
has also been held to be a part of sustainable development
there is one more case under the polluter pays principle
which was filed by m c mehta
here its known as of course, the calcutta tanneries case
and the court ordered for the relocation of the polluting
what kind of doctrines have been used by the higher judiciary
industries and also asked them to pay twenty-five percent of the land costs
let us turn our attention to the third principle of absolute liability
generally in tort law
music
there are two major issues
one is intentional wrongdoing and second is a negligent wrongdoing
and in the case of rayland versus fletcher, certain exceptions were
noted basically in fact for the negligent wrongdoing,
there is a strict liability but the
exceptions being act of god or wish major or plaintiffs consent
you are all aware of the public interest litigation,
or act of stranger or statutory authority
in so far as matters relating to conservation of environment
or protection of environment is concerned
the supreme court held that
there is an absolute liability of the
music
unit that is damaging the natural environment
in other words, there can be no exceptions whatsoever
if a firm is engaged in a hazardous
music
how the higher judiciary has used judicial innovation,
activities it has an absolute liability
let me illustrate with a case which was taken by
m c mehta against the
sri ram chemicals and a sri ram food and fertilizers and union of india
in what is also known as oleum gas leak case
here there was a firm which was engaged in a patently
hazardous chemical processes and in the release of this
toxic oleum gas affected lot of civilians and
so, the court held that the firm had an absolute liability
on account of its the hazardous nature of the activities
judicial creativity to craft new strategies to come out with
it was engaged in
let us turn or attention to the
fourth principle of sustainable development
music
if you look at the brundtland report,
which was commissioned by the united nations,
music
the sustainable development has been defined as
that process of development which meets the needs of the
current generation without compromising on the ability of
new remedies through this public interest litigation
dear students,
future generations to meet their own needs
here the on the one hand,
the principle of economics, on the other hand,
the ecology have to be integrated
and at all levels of decision making
and in the number of cases, the supreme court upheld the
principle of sustainable development
if you look at the vellore citizens forum v union of india,
which involved the release of untreated waters by the
tamil nadu tanneries
in particular we will see
the supreme court said that the sustainable development
is extremely critical for eradicating poverty
for improving the quality of human life and the court also said
the pollution should be compensate
with the carrying capacity of the eco system
in a number of other cases, the supreme court upheld
the principle of sustainable development in particular
in m c mehta versus union of india, apex court
highlighted the need to strike a balance between the needs of
development on the one hand and the
music
demands of the conservation
of environment on the other hand
in n d jayal versus union of india,
the supreme court said that, right to clean environment
and right to development are both part of the article twenty-one
dealing with the right to life and the court also said,
sustainable development is a means to achieve the both the
right to development as well as right to life in shrine
that the article twenty-one of the constitution
let us turn our attention to the fifth principle
the polluter pays principles, precautionary principles,
of the public trust doctrine what do we understand by the
term public trust doctrine? here, there are certain resources
like air
music
river, water or forests or seas they belong to everyone,
regardless of economic capacity,
and should be enjoyed by all
music
and there's one matter which went to the apex court, which involved
the case between m c mehta and kamal nath
and the principle of absolute liability
i'll tell you the facts of the case
so there was a span motels, which was given
some land in forest in the form of a lease,
and they tried to divert the river beas water, the flow of
the river as it was flooding the motel time and again
so the court came down heavily on them and said it violated the
principle of the public trust doctrine and cancel the lease of
the forest land to expand motels and also ordered after following
the due process pollution fine of rupees ten lakhs
let me draw your attention to one more case involving
and the sustainability development and
m i builders versus radhey shyam sahu here the facts are as follows
music
there was a historical park in lucknow called jhandewala park and
there was a proposal to build an underground shopping complex
below that park and in this case, a lot of it was already
constructed, but the court took the stand that here is a public trust
involved and as it was a park which was for the benefit
of everybody and the court ordered the lucknow nagar maha palika
and to ensure that the that as the park is a common resource,
which are to be enjoyed by all it rejected the
music
construction of the underground shopping complex below the park
so, in a sum or in conclusion, we have seen the precautionary
principle, the polluter pays principle and the sustainable
development principle absolute liability and the public trust doctrine
on how the supreme court through the process of
public interest litigation do the process of creating number
of innovative and creative processes and strategies applied
in a range of cases and upheld them in this process
thank you
see you in the next module
the public trust doctrine in this particular module
music
let us take up each of these principles and doctrine for
greater examination
first let us see, the precautionary principles
welcome to mooc on human rights in india
basically it involves an examination whether a
particular development process is environmentally sustainable or not
music
any substance or activity which is posing a threat to
the environment should be prevented from damaging it
and here the onus is on the actor
on the developer and the industrialist to show that
his or her actions or environmentally sound
let me give you few examples of cases
which went before the supreme court
in the last module, we saw how a number of matters came before the
for instance in vellore citizens forum versus union of india,
which is otherwise known as tamil nadu tanneries case
music
the operation of tanneries
music
polluted
music
the groundwater made hundreds of acres of lands
in five districts
uncultivable and in this case,
supreme court and other high courts regarding environmental issues
justice kuldeep singh who is known as a green judge,
held that polluter pays principle,
precautionary principle
music
and sustainable development
are all part of a environmental law
and so here
music
in the process of interpreting the law,
the supreme court said
in this module, we will see what principles and what
music
as long as certain principles of
customary international environmental law,
if they are not in conflict with the municipal law
can be relied upon and thus,
the court read
the precautionary principle or the polluter pays principle
or the sustainable development principle into the indian law
and here the court clearly
mentioned that these tanneries should not release water without
doctrines have been used by the higher judiciary in the process
proper water treatment plants
let us now take up m c mehta versus union of india
as you know in the m c mehta one of
the finest environmental activists and he filed a number of cases
in one case which is otherwise known as taj mahal case
certain coke and cold base plants in the taj trapezium area
were causing serious atmospheric pollution and they were
endangering world renowned and protected monument
which is regarded as a part of a world heritage
now, in this case, the court having regard to the
of public interest litigation dear students, welcome to mooc
precautionary principle, having regard to the
polluter pays principle asked for a relocation
of the is coal and coke based industries and the court also
said that this particular precautionary principle and
polluter pays principle are part of the environmental law of india
let's come to the one more case file by m c mehta which is known as
m c mehta (ii) versus union of india, which is also known as
ganga river water case here, the court having regard to
the precautionary principle directed all the municipalities
on the banks of the ganga river to ensure that there is no
on human rights in india
effluents, no untreated effluents are released into the river ganga
in one case filed by m c mehta
music
involving vehicular pollution in the metropolis of delhi,
in the capital city of delhi,
the supreme court order that vehicles which are more than
twenty years old should not be allowed to be operated in the capital city,
in the interests of
music
preventing damage to the environment
in this module, we will take up the
music
right to compensation has been recognized as an integral part of
right to life and liberty under article twenty-one of the indian constitution
the national commission for women ncw
was directed to evolve a scheme for providing
adequate safeguards to these victims
let me turn to another important case
chairman railway board versus chandrima das
music
the facts of the case are as follows chandrima das was a
bangladeshi national and she was raped by
music
music
few
music
government personnel, railway personnel in a rail yatri nivas
music
and
music
this case was brought to the supreme court
as a public interest petition
and the court ordered
what are the broad principles laid down by the supreme court of india
music
a sum of ten lakh compensation to the victim
and held that
music
even a foreign national is entitled to protection
of the right to life under article twenty-one
in a number of other cases involving rape
music
the supreme court followed on the
broad guidelines or parameters issued in the case of
as u have seen in the earlier modules,
delhi domestic working women's forum
let us turn our attention to another important
facet of the pil relating to gender justice
namely the sexual harassment of women at the workplace
there was a class action brought by a series of
public spirited individuals
and non governmental organization which came to be known as a
vishakha versus state of rajasthan,
the facts of the case are as follows
there was a social worker who was carrying on with her work,
public interest litigation enables
but who was brutally gang raped in a village in rajasthan
this case is important for several reasons,
here is a violation of article fourteen
relating to right to equality and article fifteen
article nineteen dealing with right to practice, profess any trade
or profession and also article twenty-one dealing with right to life and
personal liberty
there was no legislation dealing with
sexual harassment of women at the workplace at that point of time
however, the convention on the elimination of all forms of
music
discrimination against women
which is known as by acronym cedaw
music
has issued a general comment terming any such
harassment as a discrimination against women as a part of the
violence against women in the absence of legislation to
framework at that point of time, the supreme court came out with
a series of guidelines
which requires employers to prevent cases of
sexual harassment of women at the workplace
people who for economic or other reasons,
the supreme court defined sexual harassment
music
as including such, quote, unwelcome, unquote
sexually determined behaviour, whether directly
or by implication as:
number one physical contact and advances,
number two a demand or requests for sexual favours,
number three sexually coloured remarks,
number four showing pornography,
number five any other unwelcome physical,
are unable to approach a court of law for redressal of their grievances
verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature
detailed guidelines have also been laid down
to be observed amongst others on the duty of the employer
to prevent, deter, resolve and prosecute such behaviour
as well as institute a complaints mechanism
let us turn our attention to the
another case dealing with right to food
people's union for civil liberties pucl moved a pil
before the supreme court of india drawing attention to
starvation deaths in rajasthan later on, the supreme court
music
expanded the ambit of that case to cover all states of the
union of india
and issued a series of interium orders on the operation of
integrated child development scheme and other anti poverty schemes
in particular the supreme court ordered that food should be provided to
destitute women and children, pregnant woman and lactating mothers
in fact, the supreme court held that right to food not only includes
the provision of food, but also includes
right to adequate nutrition
a few cases were brought before the supreme court of india
in fact, under this bonded labourers, destitute woman and children,
in the form of pil's regarding service conditions,
there was a celebrated case of muthamma
which discriminated women who joined government of india
to notify them of the marriage and there was a
nargeesh meerza versus air india case
and there were other cases which
discriminated women and prevented them from working
in factories in night shifts and in all these cases,
the supreme court redressed and you know, the removed the
discrimination underlying in those cases
and other vulnerable sections have approach the supreme court
dear students
sheela barsy was a journalist working in maharashtra
she was deeply moved by the custodial violence
faced by women under trial prisoners
and she wrote a letter to the supreme court of india
on the problems faced by women prisoners
and in response, the supreme court gave number of directions
on the protection of women under trials,
particularly from the custodial violence
to conclude we see that public interest litigation
has enabled academics, ngos,
and the higher judiciary, through public spirited citizens
music
social workers, journalists and other public spirited individuals
to bring such important cases faced by
marginalized, vulnerable women and
music
in this process, such broad and other landmark guidelines
were given by the supreme court to handle cases such as rape
or sexual harassment of women at the workplace
let me in conclusion and one other important aspect of
female infanticide and foeticide
or non governmental organizations and took up a range of issues
we know in indian society patriarchy is prevalent
as a result of son buyers there was a selective abortion of
female fetus which distorted the sex ratio
in many districts of the country
music
in response to it, the government came out with a legislation called
prenatal diagnostics act, there was
music
cehat which was a research organization
masum which was a non governmental organization
for redressal of their grievances or violations of their rights
and dr sabu george a public spirited individual came together
and brought to that attention of the supreme court of india about the
poor implementation of the prenatal diagnostics act
music
in response, the supreme court gave a series of guidelines
it asked the government to create more public awareness
about the female infanticide and foeticide
it asked the government to amend the act
and also appoint appropriate authorities
in various states and constitute national
let us take up a few important cases which came to the
music
inspection and monitoring authorities
in response lot of action has happened
music
the legislation was amended and a new legislation by the name
pre- conception and pre-natal diagnostics act has been brought
and enacted by the parliament, there have been further measures to
prosecute errant doctors and also clinics
which practice female foeticide
music
supreme court in this process
in conclusion pil as advanced the cause of gender justice
in a number of ways and it also led to the
development of guidelines, legislations yet
there is a long way to traverse before we
music
secure, full equality for women and full gender justice
music
music
the first one is about conditions of women in the
women's remand home at agra
music
upendra baxi one of the finest legal scholars and an academic
welcome to a mooc on human rights in india
was deeply moved by the appalling conditions
music
of the women's remand home at agra
and he moved a public interest litigation
before the supreme court of india
and the court gave a series of directions
music
to redress the issue and also protect the rights of the inmates
and ask the national human rights commission
to monitor the conditions in the agra protective home
music
i'll tell you why this case is very significant
music
the supreme court also asked
the national human rights commission to monitor
the conditions in agra mental hospital, ranchi and gwalior
music
and the commission
music
later on extended it to all the mental hospitals in the country
and appointed a special rapporteur
we start week five with the first module on
music
who undertook many visits and
documented the short comings in institutions
and these have led to
music
important recommendations to the state government's
concerned and also to the central government
and this monitoring has led to a series of improvements
in the women's remand home at agra
at other mental hospitals across the country
public interest litigation and gender justice
let us turn to a case of sexual assault
delhi domestic working women's forum is a non governmental organization
it moved a public interest petition before the supreme court of india
regarding a case of sexual assault
as you know, rape, sexual assault causes a
deep and long lasting impact
it has a psychological impact on the victim
there is a guilt and there are other serious trauma
which is undergone by the victim
often the trial of these cases, re-victimizes the person who is involved
what are the learning outcomes for this module?
let me tell you the facts of this case, there were
five domestic workers who were travelling by a train from
ranchi to delhi
and they were assaulted by eight army personnel
and so in this case, the supreme court gave a series of guidelines
on maintaining anonymity of rape victims,
legal representation to be provided to the victims
and compensation and the rehabilitation of these victims
in fact, the supreme court order that interim compensation
can be given to them even without the conviction of the offenders
in fact, we aim to see how public interest litigation has
it is a which is a very important principle indeed
in fact these are known as broad parameters for the trial of rape cases
let me tell you these broad parameters
music
the complainents of sexual assault cases
should be provided with legal representation
legal assistance should be provided at the police station
since the victim may be in a distressed state
the police should be under a duty to inform the victim
of her right to a counsel before being interrogated
further or advanced principle of gender justice
a list of lawyers willing to act in these cases
should be kept at the police station
music
in all rape trials, anonymity of the victim must be maintained
music
noting that rape victims frequently incur
substantial financial loss and some of them are too traumatized
to continue in employment the supreme court observed that
it is necessary to set up a criminal injuries compensation board
music
and why doing so
is a non governmental organization and deeply moved by
the plight of labourers, who are working in stone quarries in
faridabaad in the state of haryana
swami agnivesh wrote a letter to the supreme court of india
he said there were labourers from different parts of the country
working in these a stone quarries
he also held that many of them were working under inhuman
and intolerable conditions swami agnivesh
held that most of them were bonded labourers, and that
various social welfare legislations enacted by the government,
what principles have been laid down by the apex court?
were not reaching these labourers
in fact, he gave the names of each of these stone queries,
as well as the names of the labourers
to the supreme court with a request to issue writs
in response to this serious human rights violation
the supreme court gave a number of directions
the gist of the supreme court orders in the bundhua mukti morcha case is as follows
whenever it is shown that a labourer is made to provide
forced labour, the court would raise a presumption that
he is required to do so in consideration of an advance
what is bonded labour?
or other economic consideration,
and he's there for a bonded labourer
this presumption may be rebutted by the employer
and also by the state government if it chooses
but unless and until satisfactory material is produced
for rebutting this presumption, the court must proceed
on the basis that the labourer is a bonded labourer,
entitled to the benefits under the provisions of the bonded
labour system abolishan act government of haryana should,
without any further delay, and within six weeks from
here a person takes a debt or advance or a loan from another,
sixteen december one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three constitute a vigilance committee
in each subdivision of a district government of haryana will instruct
the district magistrates of all the districts in the state
to take up the work of identification of bonded labour
as one of their top priority tasks
the state government should drop within three months on sixteen th december one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three
a scheme for rehabilitation of
freed bonded labourers in the light of the guidelines sent by ministry
of labour secretary on second september one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two
the central and state governments will take all necessary steps
say a creditor, and in lieu of which
for the purpose of ensuring that minimum wages are paid directly to the workman
employed in the stone quarries and stone crushers
and not through middlemen , let me
take you through another important landmark order passed by the supreme court
in the neerja chaudhury what's the state of madhya pradesh case
in facts of the case are as follows in the wake of
judgment issued by the supreme court of india in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two
relating to the wanted labourers in the stone quarries in faridabaad district
around one hundred and thirty-five bonded labourers were released
they went back to the madhya pradesh now hear a correspondent,
he or his dependents have to work often with
who was working in statesman newspaper, wrote a letter to the judge
who decided the earlier case on bonded labor,
mentioning that there was no rehabilitation,
even after six months after they release
the corresponded, in particular said, without land, without work,
without state governments assistance, these released bonded labourers,
was starving, and it the petition in fact, the letter brought
do the attention of the supreme court to the pathetic plight of these
released bonded labourers who were to be rehabilitated
in response, the supreme court gave a series of directions
less than minimum wages or often no wages and these are done
it said the rehabilitation must flow quickly follow immediately
after the identification and release of bonded labourers
the court said, if it is not done
the release bonded labourers can lapse back into slavery, bonded labour
the court also said grassroot social action groups,
must be closely involved by the state administration,
by the district administration in the identification and release of bonded labourers
and the court ordered, intensive survey of areas
traditionally prone to debt bondage by the vigilance committees,
working in close tandem with the grassroot social groups
often in conditions like the person who is under
and the court also asked the state governments to constitute
vigilance committees at the district level, and that the sub divisional level
and reorganize them, activate them and have
meetings of these vigilance committees held at regular intervals
for the purposes of identification, release and rehabilitation of
bonded laborers in the series of orders there was yet another
landmark order passed by the supreme court of india
in the case of people's union for civil liberties,
and the state of tamil nadu and others in this particular case,
the supreme court asked the national human rights commission of india
the bonded labour system has no freedom of movement,
to get actively involved in monitoring
the progress of implementation of the bonded labour system abolishing act
as well as the various policies for the elimination of bonded labour
and also the follow up action
after the supreme court directions on the issue of bonded labour
the supreme court asked the state governments to submit
affidavits once in every six months,
giving details of the steps that they have taken in format provided by the nhrc
and the court also asked them to take
proper rehabilitation measures
and has no dignity of work or dignity of labour
to rehabilitate the release to bonded labourers
and the court said the rehabilitation should be
land based or non land based it could be art skill,
or a craft based rehabilitation
the court also asked the government to sensitize officials at various levels
, let us take up people union for democratic rights
versus union of india case this case is known as a asiad workers case
in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two asia games were held in delhi
ahead of these games, the delhi administration engaged
over one lakh contract labourers, through the contractors,
he or she cannot change the occupation
dear students, welcome to mooc on human rights in india
and they were held in such conditions
they will make to work in such conditions
which did not follow the labour laws
and these were brought to the attention
of the supreme court by a journalist
and in response, the court gave a number of important directions
as i said, people's union for democratic rights
is a non governmental organization based on journalists
report in the mainstream magazine
the people's union for democratic right,
, in some substance, it amounts to
sent a letter to the supreme court, drawing its attention to the
violation of the labor laws, drawing its attention to the various
human rights violations in the asiad workers case
in response, the supreme court held as follows
the court said, we are therefore of the view that
when a person provides labour of service to another for remuneration,
which is less than the minimum wage, the labour of service provided by him
clearly falls within the scope and ambit of the words
"forced labour" under article twenty-three of the constitution of india
, this judgment, when you read it along with the judgment
a serious violation of the individual's human rights
in the case of bandhua mukti morcha versus union of india and others of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four
we can infer that, a, where a person gets a remuneration,
which is less than the current notified minimum wage
under the minimum wages act one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four
for the particular scheduled employment
the labour or service provided by that person clearly falls
within the ambit of the term forced labour under article twenty-three
of the constitution and where a labourer is made to provide forced labour
he is presumed to be a bonded labour in terms of the bonded
labour system abolishan act one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six
if you look at the domestic legal provisions
in conclusion, we have seen that a number of cases in which the supreme court
came to the rescue of bonded labourers in response to letters or
petitions sent by public spirited citizens ordered
release of a large number of bonded labourers working in stone quarries,
ordered rehabilitation of these bonded labourers
and also gave a number of other important directions,
including payment of compensation
and a asked the states to be vigilant
in fact fashioned a number of creative reliefs
it has shifted the warmness of the burden of proof
the constitution of india clearly prohibits beggar and forced labour under article twenty-three
to the employer to prove that a person
who complained is not a bonded labourer
music
in particular, article twenty-three ( 1) prohibits beggar
and forced labor it also criminalizes its practice in any form
the fundamental right, which is contained in article twenty-three ( 1)
is further complemented with several articles under the
part four, dealing with the directive principles of state policy
for instance, article thirty-nine (a)talks about> right to
in the week five, module two, we take up public interest litigation
adequate means of livelihood for both men and women
article forty-two talks about just and humane conditions of work and also maternity relief
article forty-three of the directive principles of state policy
talks about payment of a living wage and these constitutional
provisions have been further complemented with the
adoption of bonded labour system (abolition) act in the year one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six
and also inter state migrant workmen act of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine
, let us look at some of the provisions of the
bonded labor system (abolition) act one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six the movement this act was adopted
in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six it extinguished all the debt that has been taken by the
relating to bonded labour before we go further,
bonded labour and this act is a very stringent act
it provides for a summary, trial by a executive magistrate
there are several salient features of the act
which will take up one by one
one on commencement of this act, the bonded labour systems
stood abolished, and every bonded labourer
stood freed and discharged free from any obligation
to render bonded labour number two, any custom agreement
or other instrument by virtue of which a person was required to render
any service as bonded labour was rendered void
we need to understand what is meant by bonded labour
liability to pay repaid bonded debt was deemed to have been extinguished
number three, property of the bonded labourer was freed from mortgage etc
number four, forced labourer was not to be evicted from home states
or other residential premises,
which he was occupying as part of consideration for the bonded labour
number five district magistrates have been interested with certain duties
and responsibilities for implementing the provisions of this act
number six vigilance committees are required to be constituted
at district and sub divisional levels
number seven offenses for contravention of provisions of the bonded labour
and in this module, we will see the domestic legal provisions
abolition act or punishable with imprisonment for a term,
which may extend to three years and also with fine
number eight purpose of judicial magistrate or required to be conferred on
executive magistrates for trial offenses
under this act, offenses under this act could be tried summarily
every offence under the act is cognizable and bailable
in section two of the bonded labour system abolition act,
music
the term bonded labor has been defined bonded labour talk refers to a
person who has taken either a loan or a debt or advance
relating to bonded labour, as well as the international
and in lieu of which he or members of his family often work with
low wages or no wages for a specified or unspecified period
and the system also prevents the person from
changing his job or restricts his freedom of movement
music
this is substances the definition of the bonded labour
as given in the bonded labour system abolishing act
, let us turn our attention to the international legal provisions
relating to the bonded labour, international labor organization ilo
adopted a convention on forced labor( 29) in the year one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-four
legal provisions on the bonded labour we will also see
india is a signatory to the ilo convention on forced labour
and in fact, this convention requires
all member states to move quickly and take steps to eliminate forced labour
in addition, article four of the universal declaration of human rights one thousand, nine hundred and forty-eight
prohibits slavery and servitude
it requires all countries to eliminate it in all forms
the udhr or the universal declaration of human rights provision
finds its echo in the international covenant on
civil and political rights that was adopted in the year one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six
india has also signed iccpr
what kind of interventions have been made by the higher judiciary
in addition, the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights of one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six
music
refers to the right to work and just and humane conditions of work
india is a signatory to all these conventions and has
undertaken legal obligations flowing from these
international human rights standards relating to forced labour
or bonded labour students,let us now turn our attention to
the supreme court's directions in a number of cases involving wanted labour
first, let us pick up a case filed by bandhua mmukti morcha
headed by swami agnivesh he wrote a letter bandhua mukti morcha as you know,
on the issue of bonded labour, and in the process,
judgment, it was in very important judgment,
and in which the madras high court
clarified a number of aspects the courts specifically
drew a distinction between human rights commission on the one hand
and the human rights court on the other
it also said the production of human rights act provides
sufficient guidance on what are human rights offenses
if we look at the definition of human rights
under section two (d) it says these are rights
relating to life, liberty equality and dignity
governing the human rights courts and we will also see
music
as mentioned in the constitution of india
or in the international conventions, and the international conventions
have been further defined as the
international covenant on civil and political rights
and the international covenant on economic social cultural rights
music
or such other international covenant that has been adopted by the
un general assembly, and which may be specified by the
government of india through gazette notification
what are the practical difficulties which hamper
and , whenever there is a
in fact, the human rights courts can always draw
and interpret any human rights matter in the light of these
provisions in order to understand whether a human rights offense
has been committed or not in fact,there have been several other
public interest litigations which had been going on in other courts
trying to seek greater clarity on this matter
for instance, a public interest litigation was filed in mumbai high court
specifically with the directions to set up
or designate human rights courts in every district in maharashtra
or hinder the effective functioning of these courts
and also appoint special public prosecutors in these human rights courts
and also give training and other address, other aspects
, this pils is still going on
the supreme court of india itself,
in a number of cases, has drawn attention of different state governments
on the need to establish these courts
in fact, in two thousand and fifteen the supreme court pointed out
the provision in the production of human rights act
which required all states to establish human rights courts
and asked them to take appropriate action to establish them
and the efforts made by the national human rights commission and the courts
music
there was a case where the national commission for protection of
child rights moved against the west bengal government
it was about the protection of child rights
and the here there was an order from the kolkata high court
stating the intervention of the national commission for production of child rights
, this matter came to the supreme court
and the supreme court while staying the operation of the
kolkata high court order underline emphasis the need to establish
human rights courts in all states again, there was a law student,
for legal reform or for institutional reform in this direction
who was deeply moved by the custodial violence
was deeply moved by the increasing number of deaths in police custody
and judicial custody over the years
as have been documented by the national human rights commission,
in its annual reports this student moved the supreme court of india
and the court again, while handling this
while emphasizing the need to address starcher asked,
and in fact, it completed all the twenty-nine states of the union of india
and in july two thousand and nineteen the supreme court
again emphasis the need for all
human_rights_in_india_6913
states to designate a human rights code in different districts,
, we see that though the protection of
human rights act talked about the
establishment of a national commission or an nhrc at the national level
and shrc,state's human rights commission's at the state level,
human rights courts in different districts of the country
there are legal infirmities lacuna,
in the legislation regarding the what kind of offenses can be
tried under this human rights court, and about the procedure
to be adopted by these court
if you look at the protection of human rights act
these have hampered the effective functioning of the human right courts
, now with the supreme court taking up this matter
one can hope that in the years to come, there will be
greater clarity on this subject
and all the states will take appropriate action to designate
a court of session in every district as a human rights court
thank you
see you in the next module
music
in the chapter six, there are two sections
which deal with the human rights courts
before we go into the human rights course let us see the preamble of the
dear students, welcome to the mooc on human rights in india
protection of human rights act it talks about setting up of a
national commission at the national level
state human rights commission in states and human rates quotes,
far better protection of human rights , we see these levels,
there is nhrc at the national level, and then state human rights commission
in various states and human rights courts in the districts
and, as you know, it's very important to have a decentralized
redressal missionary for violation of human rights
in the this such machinery should be closer to home,
and it should enable an individual whose rights are violated,
today we take up the module on human rights courts
to take recourse to the remedy provided under the
protection of human rights act and seek relief
, what does chapter six of the protection of human rights act say
section thirty under chapter six of the protection of human rights act says
every state government with do consultation of the
chief justice of the concern high court may specify, may designate
a court of session in every district as a human rights court
to try certain human rights offenses
this is a very interesting provision in itself
and section thirty-one of the protection of human rights act
as we have already seen, the higher judiciary has a role
further says that the concerned state shall also appoint public prosecutors
or designate any advocate with at least seven years experience or more
to function as a special prosecutor,
to function as a public prosecutor to assess the human rights courts
pursuant to the enactment of the production of human rights act
a number of state governments have established human rights codes
they have designated a court of session
in different districts as a human rights codes
these include andhra pradesh, assam,
tamil nadu, sikkim, west bengal and uttar pradesh
as the custodian of fundamental rights under the constitution of india
but there are some legal infirmities are lacuna in the parent act
which really affected or really hampered the effective functioning of these courts,
for instance,the human rights courts or for training, human rights offenses
but the protection of human rights act does not define
what are these human rights offenses
it also doesn't clearly describe the procedure,
which can be adopted by these human rights courts
for handling these cases of human rights offenses
music
, who will take cognizance of these violations?
we have already seen the public interest litigation
is an again another important question
and what are the timelines for
disposal of these cases of human rights offenses
, these are the matters which have been
left silent in the protection of human rights act
as a result there has been, what you can say,
lack of clarity ambiguity and ,all of this
led to the situation that though,
some states have designated court of sessions
in many districts as a human rates courts it
in this module, we will see another dimension of the role of
in practice, they proved ineffective they proved dormant
and they proved inaccessible in the light of all this
music
there had been several attempts at law reform, at legal reform
to overcome these practical difficulties in the way of
the effective functioning of the human rights courts
for instance, the nhrc itself looked at its own founding statute,
and made a number of recommendations
to the government of india for amending that act
and these amendments suggested also include
judiciary with regard to the protection of human rights
music
amendments to the provisions relating to the human rights courts,
and these have been suggested based on a
high level committee headed by justice ahmadi
, the protection of human rights act was amended in the year two thousand and six
and again in two thousand and nineteen but the government really did not amend the
section relating to the human rights codes
in addition, there was a petition,which came before the madras high court
it was a criminal revision petition
and the people's union for civil liberties,
in the form of human rights courts what are the learning objectives
also moved the madras high court regarding
this ambiguity surrounding the human rights courts
music
the madras high court, in fact,
took it with the utmost seriousness, and asked
the response of the national human rights commission
in fact, about twenty-five questions were framed
on various aspects of the function the human rights courts
these include the sweep, the scope, the amplitude, the jurisdiction
of this , human rights courts and it was a very interesting
for this module we will see the relevant legal provisions
article forty-six which tries to take care of the
educational and economic interests of tribals
music
is a very important article
and the state is required to keep it constantly in view
while preparing legislations
, let us come to the background
to the setting up of the national commission for shedule tribes
soon after the constitution came into being a special officer
was created by the government
national commission for schedule tribes
music
to review the safeguards provided in the
constitution and other laws for tribals
and that's how
music
the commissioner for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes was created
subsequently
music
in need was felt,
music
, first let us take up who are these people called tribals
for moving from a single member body to a
multi member national level
advisory body, and that's how, in the year one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven
the national level advisory body was created
music
subsequently,
music
through a constitutional amendment
music
in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two the national commission for schedule caste
music
and sheduled tribes was created, and in the year two thousand and four
music
again to another constitutional amendment, these two have been separated
into a separate national commission dealing exclusively with
shedule cast and the separate national commission
exclusively dealing with scheduled tribes
, let us turn our attention to the functions of the
national commission for shedule tribes
music
i invite your attention to the following graphic
historically, some communities
which deals with the functions of the national commission for
shedule tribes in article three hundred and thirty-eight
a class five, the functions of the national commission for
scheduled tribes have been detailed
music
it says that the commission shall
music
review
music
safeguards provided under the constitution and other laws
had been living mainly in forests,
music
and make recommendations
music
for their implementation the commission
music
which is a constitutional body
whose origins are mentioned in the constitution of india
is also required to inquire into
music
individuals complaints from tribals
music
music
relating to the deprivation of their rights
music
and other safeguards
music
the commission is required to submit a report to the president of india
music
once in a year or at such intervals as it may deem fit
on theworking of
music
remote hilly areas,which are generally cut out from the rest of the society
various constitutional under the legislative safeguards
and giving its recommendations for
better implementation of various measures
, if you look at this graphic further,
the functions of the national commission for scheduled tribes
have been further expanded, amplified by the
ministry of tribal affairs through a government order
the ministry has asked the national commission for schedule tribes
to handle certain activities in relation to the protection
welfare and development and advancement of the
for generations together
sheduled tribes
music
particularly relating to ownership rights in
respect of minor forest produce to hts living in forest areas,
music
rights of tribal communities over mineral resources,
water resources, livelihood strategies,
relief and rehabilitation measures for tribal peoples
displaced by developmental projects,
, on, to address
music
issues relating to alienation of tribal people
from the traditional land and the habilitated such people
in case alienation has already taken place
music
involvement of tribles
music
in protecting forests and social afforestation
music
and take measures
music
and had been leading a unique life
dear students, welcome to mooc on human rights in india
for implementation of the
music
provision of panchayat extension
to sheduled areas act one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six
music
and reduce and ultimately eliminate
the practice of shifting cultivation by
tribals that lead to their continuous
disempowerment,degradation of land and environment
further, under class nine of article three hundred and thirty-eight (a),
which is intertwined with their
the union government and every state government is required to
consult the national commission for schedule tribe
on all major policy matters affecting st
dear students, we have already seen
the functions that have been entrusted
to the national commission for sheduled tribes
under the constitution of india
under the orders of the ministry of tribal affairs
,
music
music
it also has been given certain powers
in order to discharge the functions given to it,
particularly in relation to complaints while handling
let's say violation of rights, etc
the national commission for schedule tribes
has the powers of a civil court trying a civil suit
it can ask for any report, it can summon people
it can record evidence on affidavits
and do a number of things in order to redress the
complaints that have been sent to it
habitat intertwined with their
the commission cannot entertain
complaints which are sub judice in any other legal forum or complaint
which have already been decided by a court of law
while dealing with
music
individual complaints of human rights violations faced by
persons belonging to scheduled tribes
the national commission for st basically checks whether fir's have been properly
filed and all the accused persons have been named or not
whether investigation has been properly conducted by the
ecosystem attached to their land they're attached to their
police officers concerned particularly the prevention of atrocities act
requires that some senior police officers shall going to
or shall investigate these violations faced by the tribals
music
and whether special public prosecutors have been appointed
and whether these cases are being dealt with by special courts
as required under the prevention of atrocities act,
and whether medical assistance has been given to victims,
whether compensation has been paid to the victims
this in some talks about the individual complaints mechanism
traditional ways of culture, religion, and
under the national commission for shedule tribes
, let us look at the organizational structure of this commission
it has its headquarters in new delhi
there's a number of regional offices in different parts of the country
which act as a bridge between the national commission at delhi and the states
and basically, these regional offices
act as the eyes and ears of the national commission
and the work of the national commission is divided into several departments or wings
there is one the one hand administration
and establishment wing and there is a economic and social development wing
as a result of the disconnect
and there is a service safeguards and coordination wing
and fourthly, there is an atrocities swing
first let us look at the atrocities wing
we are all aware of the scheduled caste scheduled tribes
music
atrocities prevention act of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six rules have been framed under these atrocities act
which have been recently modified the national commission
music
is required to take up individual complaints
in relation to the atrocities faced by tribals
with the rest of the population that been facing
music
and take them up with the concerned police officers
and also monitor whether proper
redressal has been done or not the under this atrocities wing
the national commission also checks
music
complaints relating to
music
bonded labour abolishan act faced by persons belonging to tribal communities
or non implementation of the minimum wages act
social backwardness that had been facing certain other issues
, let us turn our attention to the service safeguards and
coordination wing
music
as you are aware of the constitution of india,
as provided for affirmative action by the state,
there is a reservation policy
and when tribals have complaints relation to the
implementation of the reservation policy, these complaints are taken up
by this under the service safeguard and coordination wing
at all related to complaints relating to
music
implementation of reservation are handled there
the economic and social development wing
music
looks at the implementation of the tribal sub plan
by the ministries of the government of india
or the ministries concerned in the states
and whether these things are being properly implemented or not
asked for reports through questionnaires
and also conducts detailed reviews,
with these authorities to see that
and in fact, when our country became independent
over a course of this module and the coming module,
the developmental plans reach tribals
this wing is also responsible for
various land reform acts and also the
making recommendations for educational development of tribals
the admin and establishment wing as its name suggests,
handles all issues relating to the staffing, budgetary
issues of the national commission for sheduled tribes
in conclusion, we have seen the definition of tribals
we have seen the human rights challenges faced by the tribals
you have see in the background to the establishment
and after the adoption of the constitution of india
of the national commission for scheduled tribes
we have also seen the complaints mechanism
we've also seen the working or organizational structure of the
national commission for scheduled tribes
music
we will see the issues relating to tribal
in further detail in the coming module
thank you
music
in fact you look at article three hundred and forty-one and three hundred and forty-two
certain communities have been designated as tribals
and requiring further support by the state
music
what are their human rights issues? as we discussed,they had been
music
leading a
music
secluded life away from the rest of the society
we will take up the national commission for schedule tribes
and because of the geographical disconnect,
because of the poor infrastructure
music
they had been facing social and economic backwardness
music
and if you look at the the literacy levels of tribals in particular
there woman, there is a big gap between
general population on the one hand and the scheduled tribes
on the other hand, same is the case with the enjoyment of the right to health
and they had been practicing some primitive agricultural practices
before we go further, let me outline the learning objectives for this module
like you know, cut and burns, or slash and burn or june cultivation
all of these had been contributed
music
to a series of violations
in fact, the areas inhabited by them are rich
in mineral resources, rich in water resources
music
and
music
there have been many developmental projects
who are these tribals? what are their human rights issues?
music
bead mega dams, bead industrial projects, bead mining projects
music
some of them had displaced
music
these persons belonging to tribal communities
without any work to while relief and rehabilitation
preferred land alienation is a major issue
regarding are faced by the persons belonging to shedule tribes
music
what is the mandate of the national commission for general tribe?
in fact, unplanned related distress
land related unrest is a major
music
is a major contributory factor to the left wing extremism,
which has affected a number of parts of the country
in other words, if you look at the tribals
music
with poor socio economic development,
music
with social economic backwardness had faced a number of
what is the structure and functions
important human rights challenges
and for this reason,
music
the framers of our constitution, in the article forty-six dealing with the
directive principles of state policy
music
have clearly mentioned that the state shall promote
music
with the special interests,
music
of the national commission for schedule tribes?
the economic interests, the educational interests,
of backward classes of citizens, and in particular,
those belonging to
music
scheduled castes and scheduled tribes
music
and prevent
music
social injustice and all forms of exploitation
music
and can we make a critical assessment of the performance of the
﻿hello everyone, welcome back to the session so, in this session we will learn about the texturing,
that is a smart to leave the ultimate adjustment or the final adjustment for
later on we can easily adjust the lighting and the color adjustment in compositing pipeline
before we start to explore all the techniques and the theory that are involved into the process of
texturing it is essential to see the world around you so as you allow you to understand specifically
what you required to create within the computer generated or the cg environment for your scene
a truly essential tool for just about any texturing artist is to make a grid reference library once
you stumble upon a great picture of any type of <?>cysteines</?> or the <?>sapheseria</?>
scan it, capture it into your personal hard disk and stack it for upcoming reference
for the further requirement this can help you enormously as you must never function without some
basic notion of what you are likely to create, to become a texture artist you should be observe and
shading, texturing types and how we can assign the texture and the shading upon
go through the world in this way and make a habit of noticing all the tiny information in everything
and how they are alter, how you <?>perceive</?> the real surface these are the facts you need
to create to make interesting and the believable texture and it will really
help you to become a good texture artist so, now we are learning the difference between
the shading and the texturing so, shading, shading must be the crucial stage of the procedure
whereby we start to create our lighting and begin assigning basic ideas to each one
of the model surface area parameter, for example color, diffuse, specular, reflection, etcetera
to ensure that it reacts to light properly, shading may be the trickiest portion of the
process generally but determining the right value for every of your surface
attribute could be the painful process for a small tricking looking forward the render
any model hope you have enjoyed the modeling and now you are able to create
so, whenever you are putting a tiny details in any shading, definitely you should give
a lots of time, you should understand real time features, what shade are required for example if
you have to make a glass shader definitely you should understand about the refractive index
how the glass would be reflect and what transparency required in that particular glass
now, we move onto the texturing or the surfacing process, after shading the texturing required now
it is actually the procedure where we in fact create average percent texture
for our surface where either using we are pictures or we can use the procedural texture
we will discuss about the bitmap picture or the procedural texture in upcoming sessions
the level of addition detail required depends upon the surface at hand while the shading meet the
surface reacts properly to the light, the texture we create simply use those same shading value
any kind of prop model in detail in autodesk maya application
as the best to include details onto top to create even more realistic feature into your texture
so, as we discussed, as we said there are some fundamental difference between procedural
texturing and the bitmap texturing so, what is procedural texture?
procedural technique are the code algorithm or the segment that specify some character text of
a computer generated model or effect for instance a procedural texture for a marble surface or for a
granite surface area does not make use of a scan in picture to define the color values rather it
is a use of algorithm and the mathematical feature to look into the color, one of the most crucial
tough feature of procedural method is abstraction in procedural strategy in a stage of explicitly
specifying a strong all detail into the picture or sequence, pack them right in to
the function or on algorithm and evaluate that process when and where required
so, after completing the modeling, it’s a time to start texturing and the shading
procedural techniques permit the inclusion in style of any preferred
quality of physical precision there are several advantage of procedural texture,
so the procedural texture over an image texture as follows, first a procedural texture or the
representation is incredibly compact, the size of procedural texture is normally measured
in kilo byte, while the size of texture image is normally measured into the megabyte or mb
this is also true for a solid texture since the three d texture images are really large, none the
less some individuals have utilized tomographic graphic x-ray scanner to acquired digitized
volume picture to make use as a solid texture there are some advantage of procedural texture,
first is the procedural representation does not have any fix resolution generally,
it could provide a complete detail texture regardless of how carefully you consider it
the procedure of applying the texture and the color to an object to create a <?>drendrable/?>
a procedural representation, address no fixed region, quite simply it is really unlimited in
degree and make over an attributory large region without seems and without undesired repetition
on the texture pattern a procedural texture could be parameterized so it can generate a
class of related texture instead of being limited to one big fix texture images
there are few disadvantage of procedural texture also the disadvantage of procedural texture
as compared to an image texture or the bitmap texture as follows, a procedural texture could
be challenging to build and debug, programming is hard often and development and implicit design
explanation is hard to non-trivial situation especially a procedural texture could be a shock
it is simpler to predict the result when you scan or color a texture image
some social people decide to like this property to procedural texture and call it <?>6:56</?>,
is the called texturing process when an object is created by you in maya
some cultural people hate it and state the procedural texture to hard to regulate analyze
the procedural texture could be slower than accessing the keep picture based texture or bitmap
based texture this is actually the classical period versus space spread off aliasing could be
an issue in procedural texture also, antialiasing could be a difficult and the short anali,
less inclined to be studies care immediately than it really in image based texturing
what is bump mapping? probably the most used surface property along with color bump mapping
is a way whereby we can create the illusion of irregularity or the damage, for example scrapes,
dents, and almost any type of textural green to surface area without increasing or altering
the geometry of the model at all because no surface now days is perfectly smooth, no matter
how smooth it could be appear, all areas you create will require some type of bump mapping
application for example by default the grey color should <?>arrange</?> immediately assign to it,
to be able to create feeling of tangible texture or roughness to the things
clever use bump mapping conveys the viewer a concept for the top would be feel like to be touch
bump mapping versus displacement mapping, just a little <?>step</?> for improving your bump map
is to make sure that your surface has at least small amount of specularity incase if you having
problems with viewing bump map or just wish to improve the after effect of your bump map try
upping your specular amount and this may greatly enhance your bump map effect okay, so we have
discussed the actual fact the bump mapping should not be used to <?>pay too</?> little geometry
well perhaps you have ever <?>9:00</?> that there is a method to create geometry utilizing bump map
there exists a way to achieve that and the technique is called the displacement map but
displacement map is totally depend upon the number of the vertices or the polygon whenever you have
which will let you start to see the object, fill new light and the render the picture or the scene
to generate a high detail displacement in your model you should add a lot of vertices to that
displacement map basically require a texture and deform that geometry of an object
based on the texture used since, displacement map is not actually
a texturing issue, it will not go deeply right into the discussion onto it to as a possible read
about the practical program in maya application how we can achieve the displacement map, how what
could be the difference between displacement and the bump map in our practical session in maya
however, a thing that we do have consider it normally when to make use a simply bump map
texturing, so when to make use displacement that tricky matter with displacement
and normally that get actually great displacing so, you must have high polygons count on your
model extremely which can increase rendering period automatically now, let’s move to the
either texture might appearance different after the animating enlighting the scene
﻿hello everyone, welcome back to the session, so in this session we will learn about the maya shader
along the way you can zoom it out the hypershade window to get the complete picture
you can also view in the shading network in the hyper graph window
but this view does not give you the <?>1:12</?> images types of shader, there are majorly
five types of shaders we use into the maya application lambert, phong, phong e,
blinn, ramp shade up there are two more shader usually sometime we use in maya application,
first is the background shaders and second is the layer shader now one on one we will
discuss about each and every shaders where and when we have to use these shaders
so, we will start with lambert, this material type or this shader type is the most basic
and it doesn’t include any property of specularity this make it perfect for matte
surface that do not reflect the surrounding environment, the lambert shader type can be
and photorealistic shader in maya application, how we can generate the photorealistic output
transparent and will refra-active <?>1:59</?> rendering also but without a specularity
wood, glass this could be the some example of the lambert shader or the lambert material
phong shader, usually we use phong shader to add sharp specular highlight to the lambert material
the size and the intensity of highlights are controlled by the cosine power attribute or the
property this shader can also have reflection from either environment map or the <?>2:30</?>
reflection the phong material is really very good for plastics, so any kind of plastic material,
plastic object we have to create in three d application we can assign the phong shader into it
phong e shader- phong e shader types add a different type of specular highlight
to the lambert the phong e shader includes attribute or the property such as roughness
that control the softness of the highlight, whiteness that color intensity, highlight size
in maya software with the help of some of the maya <?>0:17</?> shader or the arnold shader
we can increase with the help of the parameter we can use the phong e shader for glass,
we can use the phong e shader for making any kind of highly reflective surface
after phong e shader we have one more shader here, usually we prefer this shader for making
any kind of shiny objects, blinn material or the blinn shader, many artist use this material type
exclusively because it offer high quality of specular highlight using the attribute such as
eccentricity or the specular roll off this material type can be edited to
look like a phong editor also which has a <?>sharper</?> highlight in case where you need
better antialiasing of highlights during an animation this material would be really very
good material or the shader we can use blinn material for the metallic surface also
ramp shader- this shader give you the extra control over the way
so, before you start the shading we should know about the hypershade window
color changes with light and the view angle you can stimulate a variety of exotic material
and <?>twick traditional</?> shading in <?>subtle way</?>
all the color related attributive ramp shader are controlled by ramps only
after ramp we have another shader called the layer shader- so a layer shader allow you to
combine two or more material or the multiple material that each have their own quality,
own property, each material can be designed separately then it connected with the layer shader
the top layer transparency can be adjusted or map to reveal part of the layer below
layer shader render more slowly than other material instead using the layer shader
it may better to set up regular material, node that use or layer texture node map to
the color specular and diffuse map can create the appearance of variation in this material
shading network are behold as note that control specific aspect of shading effect
quality of the surface at end of the shader we have one more shader here called the use
background shader- usually we use background shader in <?>compositing</?> pipeline
the use background shader is primary meant for the combining <?>easy</?> and the live action
component this material assign to a stand in geometry that represents surface and the object
in the live action field this material then cast shadow and the reflection from the object into the
scene, many of the diagrams in this session or in these sections would be render with the help of
background shader in upcoming classes in compositing classes, we can use the background
shader also to compose it to add three d model into the live footage also now, let’s moves to the
the network define how various color and texture node work with associated light and surface
the placement of the texture on surface is also control by the node within the network
there are several way of viewing shading network in maya, the hypershade window let you easily
connect node and view the connected attribute you can also double click on any node to open
the attribute editor, accordingly you can change or the modify the parameter of the shader
﻿hello everyone, after completion of texturing fundamental now it’s a time to get some assignment
that’s the pass rendering system works right now we are using the layer shaders,
so you can just have the panels like render pass mode, you can have the render pass mode
if you are working in different texture but right now i am just having this parts
to just and you can see it’s all get faded, if you select it then the wireframe will show,
if you have the render view, you will found that its only just like a mask okay
so, it depends on its color features, if you have the color features like transparency definitely
transparency gonna work as you can see now it’s getting transparent and just
attracting all the things which is just overlapping the same
so, we will select this one right click assign new material and go to maya and here we have the
phong, so there are two different which is the phong and the phong e definitely phong e and
and after that you can have shift d for repeating the result okay so, i have taken five i will
phong are similar to each other but one more thing by default its lustre, shininess, glossiness value
is higher as compared to this one okay both of them you can use in any of the metals or
even to the plastic, right, hard surface okay so, phong and as you can see it has more shine
shininess because its producing by default light which is present inside maya we haven’t use any,
any lighting inside the maya right now, though i going to phong and just have all the panels which
is same, exactly same, so matte opacity just abstract the outer surface of your model
so, i will just off this for a while, you have the reytrace option also so, when you are making
any model and just putting any texture inside it, if you want to just pass any light from inside it
and just bounce into the ground or nearby object you have to check the render option refractions
select all of them and move to the center okay we will select all of them again and go to edit
and after that with a simple amount of tweaking you can have a good result for light bounciness
on ground hope you understand the same, let’s meet to the next session
and here you have the delete by type history so i will its history because history i don’t
required so i will go to attribute editor and now you can see only three things are there okay,
so no problem one more thing we have to group the model so if you can select and control g i
have already did it earlier, so grouping is very important okay, now what i will do, i will just
go to the render settings so make sure that your render using should be in maya software okay
we will focus in arnold renderer later wards but at first we have to understand the concept of maya
software texturing and also its lighting, so i have gone to the maya software and here you have
a couples of different things like common and maya software panels, after that i will close this
of shaders onto the model so, for shading we should use the hypershade option into the maya
and if i select any of them and if you press right mouse button by holding right mouse button
we will find three things which is assign new material, assign favorite and assign existing
so, this is will just allow you to overlap a new material and will replace the previous material
so you can use this assigning material or if you have any material and you have rename the
same so you can go to the favorite material and choose that particularly material which
you have renamed an existing material which is already inside your scene so you can just
put that particular material on your model so, right now i am using assign new material, so
at first as you can see we have a huge amount of panels like arnold maya but
right now i am in maya software so i used the maya software so, there are few things inside
the maya software like this one and this all came in for the mental ray panel
application, so in shading chapter we will discuss about the working with photorealistic shading as
so, like this way arnold and mental ray basically are third party plugin okay, so i will just
select this and just go to this surface so, in this surface there are these materials which is
present inside it one of the most common material is the lambert which is by default
material is present inside maya software if you select or click or make any model,
then by default material is the lambert if i go to attribute editor you will find that the by
default material is the lambert one, will delete the same, will select it go to the material editor
which i have minimized and will go to the maya these are the main materials which you
can found in any version of maya okay so, at first this is the blinn if you click over here
okay now, as you can see it has some short of shininess in it if you press
six it will show the texturing result but, there is no any light in the scene,
well as we will discuss about the several type of textures for example anisotropic, blinn lambert,
so if i press seven all the things will be dark so, no problem we will discuss the lighting thing
in the lighting session, right now i am focusing on the texturing so, we have just used the blinn,
so blinn have some sort of shininess if i go to its property feature which is just
right side on your screen inside the attribute editor, so i will go
to the blinn and here you have the color, transparent, ambient, incandescence, bump
which is all present here diffuse, translucence, translucence depth okay
that means each and everything is given over here, so if you see this if i render the same
we found that some sort of shininess is there so, with the help of the color you can definitely you
can change the color and with the help of the transparency you can transparent the same,
so now it will behave like a glass, see, okay after that the ambient color, we’ll just
phong, phong e and etcetera where we have to use and how there should be some difference between
if you increase the ambient color what happens have a look, it will just glow much more
incandescence value, it will produce some lightning effect as you can the nearby
object will be affected if you just increase the value of incandescence to any them
so, i will put this by default value which is this one and you change your color definitely
okay, i will just put somehow red and now if i go down i have the bump mapping so these are
the important features if you are working in the texture you have to undergo through this process
okay so, there is a huge amount of panel you don’t have to go each and every time,
so that means these are one of the most important thing
if you are uncomfortable with this scrolling up and down because you don’t have enough space for
that you have to just click over the copy tap now it will just have a particular window which
is the duplicate of this part so, you can put it somehow here and you can just drag easily
so, you have the more space to look at your texturing properties as you have seen which
is the bump map if i just zoom this, if i just render the same data using this
one you will found the surface is the smooth definitely yes, the surface is the smooth
and if you increase or just put some texture in the bump
so it basically depends on the texturing if, for example, if i select the wood what happens?
if i have selected the wood and after that if you just drag this, you will found this panel
which is coming at the right side on your screen which the panel of the bump, so you have the
bump depth you can change the bump value, you have the bump depth if you increase the depth
it will affect your model, see as you can see it is producing some sort of
hi everybody, so welcome to this course of introduction to texturing inside maya application
texture but it also have some sort of up and down shape so it’s only illusion that means bump only
gives illusion so, you have some sort of emboss bevel like structure on you model surface if you
decrease the bump depth definitely if it goes to minus, then it will just insert the same,
if it goes to plus then it will extend the same so, i will just put zero
and after that i will just increase little bit okay
if i just go to the render tap and now you can see your model is visible, its shapes are visible but
also the bump texture and the detail as you can see here we have some sort of gap
but it’s not gap in your model, its only in the texture that’s a main reason
for bump mapping and you can change well you click over here and you can change,
you can change the color also definitely yes but, it will not effect on your model okay
so, right now i am using maya two thousand eighteen, so i have make this model so i will
so, that’s the main thing of the bump map so, like this way you can just put the textures
of the bump and all okay so, now i will focus in this part
i will just select all of them right click, assign new material, right now maya and here
you have the lambert lambert is the by default which doesn’t have any any sort of
shininess and glossiness, it’s a dull like as you can see there is a difference between both of them
so this is by default present inside the maya software
and if i just select and just go to its property features same thing you will found here
you have the bump map, incandescence, ambient color, transparency and all
i will just decrease the value of translucent, you have translucent focus, special effects if you go
start the concert of texturing inside this so, let’s get started as what i will do,
to you have glow intensity, so it will only happen when you have a proper lighting on your scene
so, lambert is a dull material like a clay which is present by default in the maya
selecting the other one and just right click, assign new material maya and layer shader
if i go to layer shader you have few things which is the color, transparent, composite flag
and render pass mode so, it allow you to render in a particular pass step by step, what is pass
we will discuss this in pass section i will say you that the pass is basically the different type
of texture which is inside the model and you have to render one by one, at first you have
to render the ramp, after that reflection, after that surface shader, after that ambient occlusion,
after that blinn and all after having render all those things you have to go the compositing
software and just compile all the renders in the single form and just merge and have a good result,
i will just select the model and just make some duplicate control d for duplicate
﻿hello everyone, after completion of shading pipeline, now it’s a time to assign some wrap or
open uv one by one so you can see so, let’s meet to the next session
directly with the help of maya application, with the help of brush and some wiser option also
after successful completion of three d paint, we move to the render setting because
whatever we are doing with through the maya application, for final conclusion or final output,
we should have to do some render output so, for there are several options into the render view,
so we will discuss how we can utilize the render view setting in maya application
for better understanding how we can achieve the best result in maya software with the help of
particular proper lighting, proper texturing and with the help of creation of good model also
hi everyone, so in this session i will build a small and a very easy model and i will use the
uv unwrapping to texture the same so, let’s get started now, i will make a box and i will
increase the size of the box okay now, what i will do in the channel box and the layer editor
some texture or some bitmap onto the model which define the things, what kind of object should be
i will go to down and here we have the input panel which is polycube one
so, i have subdivision width, height and depths, so i will increase by two okay, no problem
and after that what i will do right click and vertex, we’ll select the top vertex
and just move it down a little bit this would be fine and after that we’ll go to the edge
or the face, i will select the face that would be better for me and i will just drag this up
a little bit okay this would be fine as you can see this is a very basic and dummy model,
<?>and</?> that’s making all the things going to the edge and just select both of them and we’ll
move somehow at the up okay, object mode as you can see that’s a dummy model because
at first you have to understand the concept of uv then you can just work for the same
so, right now what happens next, i will make a box by default it’s just forming in the center,
look like into the feature, that could be a part of aesthetic development also now, it’s a time
no problem, just decrease the size, increase all over by and just decrease the thickness,
increase little bit going to the top and just manage like, is it fine or not? let’s have a look,
as you can see the wireframe is not visible, so i have to see the wireframes so, i will
select both of them, go to shading and here you have a panel which is
wireframe on shading, just check the same as you can see, if you don’t select also the
wireframe will be shown on your screen that’s the benefit of it so, we’ll just move it somehow here
okay now, what i will do right click, go to vertex and just select this vertex and just move
it somehow here because it’s very hectic to manage from here or to manage from scale so, i will just
move it somehow here and we’ll just drag it up and we’ll just go to the side view, we’ll move it
here, somehow here and the size is very large and also we have to just move it somehow
to get learn about the uv maps uv map help you to define two d coordinate system of your three d model,
here, that would be fine moving above here and object mode
for rotation if i rotate it will be very hectic to rotate like this okay, so what i will do,
i will just press d, that’s the pivot, it can adjust the pivot here, so i just adjust the pivot
and just rotate the same, so as i rotate it’s very large, control z, so going to vertex again, select
this point and just move it somehow here, object mode okay, now rotate the same, let’s have a look,
it working fine or not? problem we will just shift it somehow here
and one more thing you have to do just select this part,
already the pivot is at here, so just move it somehow here, move it down and also
press d again, just align it, somehow here select this part and we’ll go to the perspective,
i think we have to just decrease its size, so vertex select this and just move it somehow here,
so <?>easily</?> we can paint out three d model into two d map form and later on that two d map we can easily
right click, object mode, select this part
and go to edit and here you have duplicate special, click over here
so, right now i am not using instance because if you click on instance whatever you do changes it
will automatic update in the opposite side, so i’m not using the instance, instead of having instance
i will go for copy so, i will just go to edit and just reset the same and as you can see the z value
is one, so as you can have the look, if you select the model it has three axis the blue is facing to
the z, so i need in this direction, what i will do, i will just select this part and in z i will
just press minus one and apply the same so, right now it has been applied and
just manually rotates the same little bit of it ok, no problem
so, as you can see it has been done and i have to define the boundary also if you need any box to
assign onto the three d model for further use after completion of two d map, we have some
be kept at the top you can kept but right now i will just leave it as it is and we’ll just make
a box and i have to make the boundary, so i just making the new box and just put it over here
one more thing i have to tell that, i will make only one strip of the boundary and we’ll copy
the same because i have to apply only one uv and just copy the same, so it will just repeat,
that’s the main thing so, we’ll decrease the size little bit both of them and we’ll increase
its height so, we’ll put it somehow here and one more thing, right click, go to face and
just select this face, move it somehow here if you press shift, you can have the extrude,
okay so, by pressing shift you can have extrude, so i will extrude it little bit like this,
object mode and i will make a new box again and just move it somehow here,
we’ll select both of them and we’ll isolate it,
<?>projects</?> and techniques also available into maya application like planner mapping, cylindrical
and we’ll isolate here from here also, and we’ll isolate from here also
and finally we’ll have to see in the front, so we’ll isolate the same, and move it somehow here
and we’ll keep it at between them, we’ll decrease the size,
increase its length, width, move it here, not too much, this would be fine okay
i’m not attaching it, that’s the basics of uv so i’m not attaching it, when you will
have a detail uv classes you can have to attach and have a complicated model to build the uv,
that would be fine, okay but, that’s the basic for uv and as you can see we have just make this
<?>scene</?>, you can say if you have some simple scene also you can isolate that means you will not
get distracted from here or you cannot directly or by <?>incidently</?> you can
mapping, spherical mapping we will discuss this all texture projection methodology in maya
select any of them because you have to focus in this part only, so can have the isolation
that would be very beneficial as you can see here, we have very basic
model of a hut, we don’t have any door, window and all, we don’t have any fence and all
so, one more thing i have to do, i just duplicate the same control d
and just put it somehow here, as you can see each and every part is different from each other
so, that’s the very basics for uv and when you are studying for that you can have a complicated uv,
we’ll do in a complicated model okay, no problem i'm just put it somehow here
and select this part, go to face and just select this one and by pressing r if you select shift
button and just move it, inside it you can have to extrude the same and we’ll delete the data
so, i have a blank space, right now what i will do, i will go to edge and we’ll select the
application also after successful learning on uv maps, shaders and the fundamental of texturing,
boundary, if you select any one of them, just double click it
and we’ll press w and just move downward little bit, not so much because it’s basically dummy, so
right click object mode so, this is the chimney part of the house, we’ll out it somehow here,
it should be small not so high that would be fine okay so, we have only one boundary,
we’ll just copy the same and we have a hut so, i will just save the file,
okay no problem i have saved the file and now in the next session, what i will do, i will just
open all the parts and we’ll go to the,
so you have all the things like uv here and we’ll just switch to the texturing panel for more
texturing view so, we have three d paint and also, we have create psd network so,
we’ll look at it and at first we’ll just focus on the uv part, so we’ll
now it’s a time to get learn about the three d painting tools, where we can easily <?>paint</?> three d model
hello everyone, so in this session i will open the uv of this hut and also this barricade part
in the z direction, so apply and project
is the y, apply and project
finally, this one which we have already worked, so we have the four parts which we will connect this
select this part, just rotate the same, so as you can see if i go to edge and just select
both of them, so as you can have a proper look that both of them can be connected because
if you are select this one, it will automatically highlight into the other part
so, that’s the wrong way, you have to just select each and every thing, right click go
go to uv, if you select this and for a time i will maximize it
if i want to rotate, it’s not rotating in a snap way
so, what i will do, i will select all of them, we’ll go to tool and
here we have rotation so, i will click on its window panel and in tool settings you have snap steps, so that
says off, we will on it and in every fifteen step we will snap the same
same with this one as it is already being in a right way, so we’ll click at the shell,
right click, edge, select both of them and we’ll sew it
so, as you can see, each and every part has opened, we don’t have to require this part
to face, just select by holding shift button one by one
because already as we have told you that, this will be connected to the other
so, we’ll go to object mode and isolate the same of all this and all the parts has
been opened
so, in next session, we will learn how you can add some textures and how it can be implemented
on your model
so, let’s continue to the next session
as you have seen this part has been selected and we’ll go to uv and here you have the planar
so, instant of using this one you should go to have in the window button and after that
when the option came, here you can see its facing towards the z direction, so here is
the projection from z-axis
if you apply then it will just cause the same, after that you have to hit on the project
and then it will close
so, i will just move it over here and we’ll select this part by holding button and after
that we’ll go to uv again, here we have the option
so, as we have discussed that we will just open this uv of that particular part and we’ll
and as you seen that, x is facing this part, so we’ll go to the x and apply project and
we’ll close the same
we’ll move it somehow here, later wards we’ll just put it inside this corner of
the box, so that all the things will be aligned in a proper way
we’ll select by holding shift, so i'm in face mode, now we’ll go to uv and here you
have the planar again, so to its property feature, as you can see z is facing this part,
so we’ll go to the z-axis and apply project, we’ll move it here
this is the front one and this is the back part
we’ll select all of them, it’s forming the square shape but we required the proper
triangulate and the square both
just duplicate copy and we’ll surround the hut
planar, x direction and apply and project
as we have said that the triangle and the square has came
so, this would be the last part which we have opened, this one also and that’s the ground
part, so we don’t require to open it because we don’t have to paint something here, right
click and object mode
make sure that whenever you are working in uv or any other file, you should have a save
and also you should make a new version
after getting save, you will un-isolate it because we have more parts which is at the
top, so i will just select both of them
so, let’s start, so at first i will just select the part and as you notice that our
at first we’ll just focus this and isolate it
go to uv and here you have the cylindrical mapping
as you can see that this structure is like a box but it’s revolve around it, so what
happens now instead of using planar we should go for cylindrical
and here you have the panel okay, apply and after applying its forming the half cylinders,
so i will just click over here and just remove this and we’ll touch it to the end point
as you can see when you open your uv editor, the thing has been unwrapped properly and
after that the top part which is this one, we’ll select one by one, go to uv and have planar
pivot size is small
because that’s only a plane and if you look at your axis which is facing in the y direction,
so y would be fine and apply project
this thing has been removed
that’s the last part, so we don’t require to open it and also the inside part, this
one, if you need to open you can but i think if you just paint something here, it will
just match the same
let’s have a look, go to object mode, control s, make sure that you are saving your file
and isolate it
now, this one, so i will open only one and i will just copy the same here, right click,
face, select this one, so we don’t require to open here but, yes definitely because this
so, i will just press plus sign to increase the pivot size
part will be visible, so better to open it
that would be fine, object mode again, select this one and just isolate the same
if you are opening uv here and if this part is just duplicated over there, we’ll just
replace this one
go to face, select this face and uv and here you have the planar
as it is facing in the z direction, go to apply and have project, now go to uv editor
and just see, it’s forming quite well, we’ll adjust the size later wards
so, i will just put darker color at the corners but i have to remove this face, so uv and planar
so, it’s facing in the z direction, apply and project
so, both of them we have open and object mode again and isolate it
now, at first i will select this part and just go to the isolate selection, as you can
finally, we have this part, which we have just make this, both of them are separate
with each other, that’s a box and that’s you can say the boundary part
select this one and after that go to uv, but at first you have to select the faces, otherwise
the front, at the top and the bottom will also be selected
so, go to face and just select them
i need only this part, that would be fine and after that go to uv, and cylindrical
click over here apply, select the red part and just move it here
now, as you can see the cylinder uv has revolved and also go to uv editor and just see its
result, it’s forming quite well
and now the top and the bottom part
see all the things has been gone
as it’s facing in the y direction, so y-axis apply and project
we’ll remove here, we’ll have to keep the size of a particular side okay, because
as you can see, it’s taking the size of a particular area, so i will just decrease
the size by pressing r and just move somehow here
when we’ll start working in the checker, we will have to adjust it because each and
every box should be at its original size and nothing work should be <?>displaced</?> like
if you have some box whose size is much more as compared to the other parts, that should be wrong
so, each and every box should have the same size and we’ll off this for a while
the downward part we have to remove this, so go to uv and uv editor, at first go to
planar, facing on the y-axis which is already we have taken, apply and project
we’ll go the uv which is inside the modeling tab and in uv you have the uv editor
so, one more thing, this part and this part they have different sizes, the top one is
the larger as compared to the bottom one
that means the top will always been larger and we will kept this top at the top one and
this should be go here
finally, we have the box, and isolate the same to have a look at the box
select the box and right click face, we don’t require to open this part because each and
every boundary will just connected to here and we will have duplicate copies
so, we don’t require to open this two part, we will just open the side one and so we’ll
as you can see this part is just open like this way
﻿hi everyone, as you have seen that we have opened uv of this hut including this one
move it here and here
now, next we’ll just do one more thing
so, i will just select delete and
now i will save the file go to file and save as, desktop and we’ll go to jpeg,
okay, control s and minimize the same will go to maya, and will select this part,
a lots more of history, so first i will save the file i will go to delete by type, history
so, it will clean up the history now, we have lambert and click over the color and here we
i will just go to the image and you have the uv snapshot
have the file click and her you have the image name, click and now we’ll choose the texture
so, here is the texture and will open the same if i press six, you can see it is showing over here,
can fix this in this tutorial only and,
so what i will do, i will just select this from uv and at first, will just
we will go to create uv shell select and move this here and just increase the size
just drag this and just put it somehow here select this and put it somehow here
i will select this file and as you can see, we have
but at first, i will go to uv and select all the files and go to image and here you have the
go to the image and here we have the uv snapshot in image and again will jut browse the same and
so, we have this file and will drag this in photoshop
enter, after that, will just delete the top one right click, rasterize layer and now we
have to just shift all the things so, what i will do, i will do one more thing, i will just
select this part, which is four and will move somehow here
now, as you can see, we have a seam which is been generated over here
so i will go to brush, eraser we have the soft eraser and after that we just erase the seam data
uv snapshot so, as you can see, its image format is maya iff, i will change it to
so, we do not require any seams this is a seam which is forming here
now as you can see, it has formed quite well and also has proper lining
window here, the another one somehow here
and now, we will just open the texture
in this layer only and put some more here
this one is fine we have to figure out if it is possible to remove all those thing, okay, fine
png if you have jpeg then the gray background with the grid will also form so, i don’t
so, i will select all by shift selecting remove this part which you do not require
so, it is removing from here also we’ll delete this data,
delete control d select this file which is four
and delete it now, we have this panel, no problem we’ll select this part,
put it somehow here, okay and, as you can see, it is overlapping,
so, i don’t need this place select the data and delete the data same, control d after that,
we’ll just select this part
and we’ll just delete the same, control d as you can see that, there is a part which is forming
here and we do one more thing, we just go to eraser's data from here and after that what we will do we’ll just
copy the upper part from this portion by holding alt button and we move it here we move it here
require jpeg and i need png and the texture value is quite good increase this little bit
select this and just move select this and just move, select this and move
and
so, save your file of the upper data, and go to file and save as
and go to jpeg and save, so i will replace this, okay
and uv area is tile okay apply and close cut this half and right click, object mode
and will go to photoshop so, right now, i am using cs six and we’ll paint the texture
so as you can see, the photoshop has been opened and i also have some references and
also the texture so, i have this reference i will follow this and will have this amount of
textures for the wooden house so now, what i will do, i will just go to photoshop and
so, right now, what i will do is select this hut and will go to the uv and here we have the uv editor okay
at first i will just drag the uv and now i have just dragged the uv and
i will just make a new layer and will click over here and alt backspace and i will just put
here so as you can see, we have all the panels, this one, this one, if you zoom, you can have
a proper look at your models and at your uv models so, if i go here, if i open my uv editor
and if i go and put it somehow here for the quick examin purpose only
now, as you can see we have this house and right click go to face, so this would be the
front part so, what i will do, i will just go to the front part this would be the front part and
we’ll just import the texture one by one and now, for that i will just go to any of the, i
think this would be fine, and go to the photoshop and just select, just move it over here okay
so, as you can see, we have just inverted the texture and one more thing we have to do
so now, i will just select all the files
and now, what i will do is press t and will stretch this a little bit and will select this
and just move it somehow here so you can see, seams is generating ok and no worry we’ll just
sort it out and both of them i will select both of them by holding control right click,
rasterize layer at first, this is at the top, so i will just select the
soft eraser as you can see here the soft eraser opacity is thirty three percent, no worry
we’ll just click like this, so i should have a clean and good texture
okay that’s very important so, you have to paint the texture like this so, i will merge the layer
and will just select this and just move it somehow here okay
and after that, we’ll go to eraser again and just select and just
by going to uv and will select all of the file and just scale it down and put it somehow here
we’ll select both of them, merge layers then move it here, move it here
as you can see i am overlapping it, no problem okay fine
so, i will just select all of them, merge layers and we’ll just move it somehow here
okay now, as you can see, this part needs to be cut it off, so i will just cut this part
delete, control d,
so that’s the section and what i will do, i will
go up to here and drag this into here and just put it somehow here
and if i delete, it will delete the entire part but, i need this part to deleted, both of them
so, i will just hold control shift and i for inverse selection and delete the same, control d
okay now, we have to lay this out, so i will select this one and just move it here
as you can see, we have deleted the part and just put it somehow here so, if i just off this,
you will found proper look so, i am making the gate and i will just put somehow here
take a brush and just select this, any of the crunch brush so, at first i have to just
examine the first so, i will make a new page so that i will examine my brush
that would be fine like this way you have to paint so, always paint in new layer
if you have to paint, you have to paint in new layer so, capacity would be down
so, randomly i am painting okay and now, as you can see you can just turn
the opacity to be little bit down and also you can change the blending work from here so, you should
just click the downward arrow, as you can see, you can change and also just copy, one more control j
that’s the down part, so we don’t require it so, i will just select this
and go to normal and put it down a little bit okay, so that you have a grunge kind of look
so now, one more thing we have to do we’ll just go to the opacity hundred and
make sure that nothing happens into the layer select one point and click over here click and
shift click over here you have a proper line, click and click like this way and also you have to
okay now, we’ll do same thing we’ll turn off
the upper layer and after that we’ll just decrease the opacity and we’ll just
select this control j and will go to this part and just go to normal and will turn down the
opacity a little bit okay we have a random kind of look and here, we need some window like,
so what i will do, i will just select any of the part i think this would be fine or even,
i think this would be fine, so we’ll just decrease the size,
make sure that your layers should always be at the bottom so, we have this top white layer, which is
the wireframe of the model as you can see here, this one so, that should be at zero after we
are satisfied with our work, i will just off this and will render the same data now, we have this
window and also we need to just rasterize the same after that, we just select this part
and do the same what we did but right now i will just use alt backspace, control d
and that is matching because this texturing also i have taken from here just click and just
select this one and just put it somehow here and select this one and put it somehow here
and we’ll just merge the same now, it’s complete and also we have to select this, which is two,
move it somehow here
as if i go, select this part, you can see this is the part where we have to
put the texture i will just put this texture over here same and here also
i have put the texture and after that make sure
that you are saving the file which is very important we don’t have to put here
so, now what we’ll do, let’s make some more space, control s*,
that should be at the top there we have to just
put the windows so, i will select and just move it here
one i need right now and we’ll just off all those
so, as you can see,
here is the part and just put it somehow here
we’ll start painting for the same,
whenever you are painting, you should always open your model and see
make sure that you are saving your file, continue now, what i will do,
﻿hello everyone so, as we have painted the texture, now what i will do, i will just select
and after that, for a time i will do one more thing, on this and you can see it stretching
quite well that’s why we have to stretch it out so that this square shape will form
and also will decrease the size, okay so, we’ll select all of them,
we’ll go to image and here you have the uv snapshot, click over here and browse
upper roof underscore zero zero one, save the file and apply and close,
okay that part has been applied and after that, next, okay, we have to just
skip this so, i’ll just go here and here we have the files so, i just put it in the photoshop
the roof part exactly so, i will just select this part and will put in the photoshop
this part, go to color and just click over here and just put that particular texture
we’ll just rotate this, so we need minus ninety put it somehow here,
select and move we’ll select all of them,
you can see, is forming quite well
what i will do, i will select this part and delete the same select this part and
will go to edit duplicate special
i need in the z direction, so apply, rotate the same
and now i will just go to this part and will open the same as you can see we have painted
you can put whatever you want here so, you can put it
and now, this part
so, that should be like concrete so, will go to uv, uv editor
now, i will go to r and just decrease the size and just put it here this part,
and now, we’ll select all of them and we’ll go to image, uv snapshot, browse,
chimney underscore zero zero one, save the file go to photoshop
put it here, make a new layer, put it the black color as we have this part,
this one also
and all things is just lined up quite well, like this way, okay so now, i have the top part
and now, rasterize, delete, control d
and the top part, so what i will do is, i will just select this part and move it here
blending so, rasterize layer select the eraser, opacity is thirty three percent rub it
okay, and rest is fine i will put it black, no problem
and also we will just put this texture over here, somehow here control d,
right click, click horizontal, put it somehow here off this black
and just opacity little down, put it here
so, as you can see, we have this part, so, i will just select this area, particularly this area,
so, i will just select this and will go to uv and uv editor as you can see, we have the top part
showing, okay no problem
finally, this area
uv, uv editor
this part needs to be corrected
make new layer, go to the wood texture
which is lying over here so, i will go to uv and just select this one put it somehow here
as you can see, we have just made this and i will just put the black part at the top so,
i will just make a box here and now,
so you can see, we just formed this part and one more thing i have to do is make a box here
select this part, just the top and what i will do is i will go to here and go to labels and
now, what i will do? i will go to maya, select this part,
assign new material, lambert and click over here click here and
and now,
this one we don’t require, so what happens, we’ll just select this part
after that we will select this part, click over here, click here and we will go to the panel,
now, we’ll select this part
as i think at firstly, let us have a check is it working or not go to file, click and select this
i think we have to change the texture,
select both of them, control g, control d,
control g and select this, go to window and here you have the outliner and we will go down,
control d select this, control d
control d
i think we have to delete this
control d, shift d
and now, select this section, control d,
move somehow here
so, control g for group that is the hut region shift control h for hiding all those control g
for group and after that, you can see that the hidden parts get hidden we do not require this
type of group which does not have anything so, i will just select this and delete, delete, delete
and just shift h to unhide the scene as you can see we have just formed this
select the face this is the face, okay so, i have to just go to uv and planar,
so, you can do this by yourself control s for saving your file which is very important,
and as you can see it is facing in the y direction, so y, apply
﻿hello everyone so, in this session, we will start the uv unwrapping of this model
there is that part so, right now it is better to have another,
another uv which is the planar obviously, it is facing on the x direction, apply and
yes definitely, casted by default, it is very large, no problem, will just move it somehow here
select this part this is the top one this is the top, second and this would have to go here,
okay just move it and just scale it down, scale it down again and just move it here okay
so, if you just go to edges, if you just select both of them, as you can see, if you have selected
one, automatically it will show that, this should be attached so, i will select both of them and
do one thing, here you have cut and sew so, you have to sew it, okay so,
and if you have cylindrical surface, you can use the cylinder
your edge will be sewed to each other that’s the benefit of uv and also i on this and just check
whether this is fine or not no, that is not fine so, what i have to do, i will just go to uv and
just select its part and just scale it manually as you can see, now it is working quite well
but, not the small one so, i will just select the small one
and just move it here and have to match the boxes so that’s very important to match the boxes,
okay fine, it’s working quite well the front part is fine but not this one so,
we’ll go to face, just select this one, as you can see, it’s over here
and what i have to do, just off this and now, will just go to uv and just select this uv
at first, just select all of them, just move it downward little bit, control z because we have
selected this one also we’ll select this part and just move it downward and now select by holding
if you open the uv, uv editor, so as you can see, here is the toolkit of uv so, i will just
shift button, one o one point and after that just move it down so now, we have the gap of the,
that should be at the top that should be at the top and
that should be at the down so, we’ll just manage it for a while just open it and just see,
is it working no, that, that’s thing should be maintained so,
i think this is, okay, little bit of problem is there
and
now, the problem has been shut outed and control s, save the file
as you can, we have just opened the uv of all the parts so, right now, we will just focus
on the top because, yeah, definitely we have to work for the same just select the top part only,
we’ll select the top and obviously the side one first i will select the side one,
drag this down little bit, okay, and will just put somehow here so, i can just click
okay now, just go here
as you can see, it is just enlarged, so i have to just match through the same
open this now, the part has been sort out, no problem
that’s very important don’t stretch like this
and also this one, so we’ll off this for a while go to uv and just select points
that’s this one that should here, that should be there,
okay and, okay, rest is fine click over here let’s manage the same
this part need to be corrected at first just select this part, this one
over here and just click over here will found this, okay so, that’s the main feature of uv
no problem if your checker is different in size, no problem you can just save it like this
as you have seen that we have just opened the uv and now, in next session,
we will open the remaining parts, so make sure that whenever you are just working, just save
your file which is very important so now, you have a proper uv which has been opened here
and in next session we will just save the file so, i don’t require to open the uv
at the downward because only paint at front and this side and this one
if the color of the uv is lighter or darker, no problem, you can fix this
well, of all the features and parameters, right now i will just in-isolate it and will just
open the uv of the rest of parts like this one, this one and this one, okay
and click over here, you will just have this uv toolkit and one more thing i have to do
so, let us meet to the another session
so, i need this panel, so right now i will just off this okay
if you see here, you will found the sub tools which is just kept over here that is the panel
these are the few tools like move, rotate, scale, as we do in the normal modeling and will just
minimize this little bit and make sure that whenever you are working, you should have this
area when you working for the uv and unwrapping any of the object you will keep all its file into
so, let’s continue so, what i will do, i will just select the model, open the grid and just move it
this so, i will enter the same and just go to the photoshop for adding some textures okay
now what i will do, i will just make this side and if i select this part,
as you can see, the part is looking like this so, we have to just open this by proper manner
so, what i will do now, i will do one thing is that, i will go to the
as you have seen that we have selected the front faces and now what i will do, i will
just go to uv and here we have the planar so instead of clicking over here, you should go
to its property window as you can see, it is projecting in the z direction, okay
so, if this is projecting in the z direction, we have the z axis and apply as you can see,
it is set over here if you look, you will found this so, i will just move this for a while
somehow here, okay now, as you can see, we have just filled this model and we have to open uv
we have to fix this part, as you can see, it is not showing here but there is this part
so, we will fix this laterwards i will just move it here, somehow here and now will select this back part
by holding shift button and again i think we have to change this, i think to x axis, apply
as you can see, because, you have to look at this co-ordinate points now, this thing has just
as you see the shape is very different, okay, we will shut out this later okay
definitely we have to work for the same, otherwise there would be a huge problem
so, i will just select all of them as you can see what i am selecting, it’s just updating here
that’s the fundamental of uv that’s the main feature of uv
so, i will select all of them what i will do, i will just go to the z axis and just apply
now it’s separated, as you can see so, we have now two parts, this is the front one
so, i will select this part at first and what i will do, i will just go to the uv which is inside
if i go here, you will find that this is the front part and this is the back part
this one is the back one, okay so, here we have some parts left what i will do now,
for a comfort way, i will just click this and have the isolate selection now, i can see easily
so, go to face, select the parts by holding shift button, okay and we have lift this one
so, right now, you can see that it’s facing on the x direction so, i will go to x and apply,
we have to just break this part,
we have left one part, i think two, three, four, five
the modeling panel so, uv, you have uv editor, okay, but at first what i have to do, if i open
part, which we have already so, as you can see, these are the garbage part which is just here
and if you want to open, you can but i think we do not require, but still will open the same let us go
to the uv and have the planar and as you can see, we will allow it to project from y axis so, that
is the main thing as you can see, y axis and just project the same and this has been left okay
so, we will sort out this later as you can see, we have just all sorts of uv which has
been opened by us, and as you can see there is a small panel for grid, checker if i click here, if
your checker is not in square, so as you can see, these are not in square, these are in rectangle
that means your uv is been disturbed and that should be corrected, exactly if
you have like this type of checker forming at your surface that means, this should be
corrected, otherwise if you add some texture, it will just stretch your texture like this
uv, we will find that uv is looking like this so, what i will do now, i will just select the
so, it is very important to examine with this that is very important so, i will go to uv toolkit
and now, i will just off this because i do not require it, the attribute editor okay
so, i have now space, proper space for managing all the things, and i will
just synchronize it little bit because, okay, we have to just examine it
but, few things we have to take from here because this is very important tool, which is uv shell tool
what is this? we will just discuss this in this topic only and as you can see,
here we have some problems so, i think we haven’t opened this let us have a look,
like this one and if i see this is stretching so much, so i will select all of them,
i will on this and just move it like this so as you can see, it’s not stretching too much
part, like one by one i just select the part and will just open the uv so right now, i will just
let us fix the shape it is very important, okay same with this one
which part is this? this is the back part, i suppose so, as you can see,
this would be very hectic, if you are in uv mode, if you are selecting any vertex if you need to
select in one click, you have to click over here, this is the uv shell tool just click over here,
as you can see, all the things has been selected so, i will just synchronize this down and move it
somehow here, okay, and make sure you that you are saving your file which is very important
and also will just check this and just have a look that it is working fine or not
okay, so we will manage this laterwards
okay now, we will synchronize this little bit
select this part
use one or two things like planar unwrapping so, i will go to uv and you have the
that would be this one so, it is stretching quite very, not so high but yes we have to fix it
we have a proper square, then it would be fine, okay
so, move somehow here because we are checking the uv and will move somehow like this
so, now, this part should be corrected this is that part and obviously, yes there is
the upper part which has been connected from here we will shut out the same
so, i am going to vertex and will off this for a while and just select this vertex
and will go to uv and move as you can see this part, this is that vertex which we have moved,
control z so, what i will do, just move this downward, select both of them by shift selecting,
will move this downward and now you can just select both of them
planar mapping, spherical and cylinder so, it depends on the shape so right now, we have box like
as you, this part is the upper one and this is the lower one, okay so, what i will do now,
i will just go to the uv and just select that part also, so will go to face and just select this one
as you can see, it’s been merged here so, we’ll go to uv again and just select
this one by holding shift button so, if you are having this arrow which is very large,
you can just press minus button to small it so, that you have a proper handle, just move it
downward a little bit as you can see, this is the top one and this is the bottom one after that,
here is the last one so by plus you can increase the pivot size and save your file
so right now, what we have next, we have this part so, we’ll select this part
and for that, what i will do, i will just go to face and just select this part,
okay just move it somehow here and just open it as you can see the file is not proper, so just
structure so we will use the planar okay and spherical also, when you have round surface
﻿hi everybody so, in this session, i will make another model which is also a exterior model and
just shift it over here that would be the one pillar and will duplicate the same
but at first, i will just make the center part now, what i will do, i will just go
to face and just select this face as you can see, i am just making from this model only,
okay so, one more thing, i should have proper spacing between them so, just select this part
and move it somehow here go to face and just select this face, will move it somehow here
no problem and will keep it here, will just duplicate the same
and now, that is the time to attach some edges so, i just putting some edges here,
okay and also i need some edges here also so, i will just need some edges here
select this face, select this part, move it upward little bit, select this part,
i will just open the uv for that so, let us start so, i will make a model of a dam and
move upward little bit okay now, we have to make the rest part
like i will just select a box, make a new box and now we will go to channel box layer editor
and here we have some division width, height so, for width, i will press two, i need three i think
okay fine, and rest would be okay, no problem will just decrease the size little bit
will just adjust this laterwards at first, i have to just place it and now, will go to insert
edge loop tool, so i will just put some edge here and only one i require i just select the face,
will delete the same select the face, delete the same select the face, delete the same
now, you had a blank, blank space
so, i am just off the grid and edge, double click, select all the edges this part also select it so,
we have to select it manually, we will select the three of them and just move it somehow here, okay
what i will do, i will just go to box and now i will just select this box and just move it
now, one more thing, right click vertex, will select the vertex
and press v for vertex map as we have snag and just like this vertex, shift select, right click
and here you have merge vertices, okay that is the thing has been merged click here, control z,
okay like this way, we just have to merge the vertex same with this one, press v for vertex
snap and just select this part shift by holding right mouse button, merge vertices, merge vertex
okay so, we have done this and now
what i will do, one more thing i have to do it so, i will go to the front view so,
we have the front view and just on the grid because we have to see the ground level as you
can see this going down, so will select this and just move it here this would be fine, no problem,
somehow here and somehow here, okay i think this would be fine one more thing i have do
okay so, will select this part and will select both of them same we have did it,
wireframe on shading and make sure you are saving your file so, i will save the file, okay
so, i will just save, ext underscore zero zero one we have saved the file and now
we will go to vertex and select the vertices and just move it downward direction and will
select this part and just move it downward again and one more thing we have to do i think this
would be fine and select both of them just move it at a grid let us have a look
so, right now for quick examine purpose, i just transparent it because i have to see the
okay we have to decrease the size, no problem, will just fix it right now
will go to face, select this faces, move it downward, the back
as you can see, whatever i will click, it is just forming in between the grid
and we’ll also select this faces, move it here ok, fine, i think this would be work
this can be work that’s a very dummy model after getting your model to be done,
then i will add some extra segments because we have to open the uv in very low segment then,
we will add some extra segment and just do the detailing, so,okay, one more thing we have to do,
we have to just give some edges here go to face, select this faces, by shift selecting and move it
we’ll just duplicate this one also here only one time i will duplicate this part here and
will duplicate this into all of them okay now, as you can see, we have formed our model
and one more thing we have to do, i am just on the grid for a while, will go to box and just
select a box and just make a box and will put this box at the downward region as you can see here,
so, i will go to create and here you have the polygon primitives
so right click, vertex because, i am forming a dam, so i need a slope, okay object mode and
we have to adjust it here so, again will just go to wireframe on shading, no problem,
will off the grid you can say we have to examine carefully so, will just put it somehow here
and turn off the grid now, what i will do, i will just go to vertex
and just select this vertex only and just move it somehow here, okay here, this would be fine
that is the slope face, select this part, move it down that would be enough
so now, i have to duplicate this also like this way, control d and just select this and move it,
shift d and will duplicate it, okay but, at first i have to go to the texturing and
all and just put some texture, so that we will just duplicate it i think this would
be fine and will just make a new box will turn on the grid and just make a new box
so, there is the interactive creation i will just check this, okay now, if you click here,
put the boundaries
okay, vertex, which i can do it in skill mode also, but, okay let us prefer the vertex right
again, just decrease, okay wait, i think here would be fine object mode and
right click, okay, we have to just insert one edge here, somehow here
and go to vertex, select this part, move it here face, select this part, move it here okay
so, as you can see, we have just formed this dummy model inside maya two thousand eighteen
now, after having unwrapping and after getting textured, i will just add
some more segments so that when i press three, it will not just look like this,
okay for that, i have to just make some segments at the corners of it and will just
you have to drag this that would be fine for me right now so, i will just select this part and
will just increase the size, little bit of it and move it somehow here,
see like this and just move it and now right click, face, will select this face extrude,
﻿hi everyone so, welcome in this course now, i will just open the uv of this part so, at first
as you can see, now it’s looking quite well, okay so,
the top part should be managed
uv and we’ll select this move it somehow here
this part we don’t require because that is the side part and we have to connect it
right click space, select part by part,
okay so, i don’t think so we require the top part and this part is fine
and now we’ll go to uv and here you have the planar so right now, i will just go to z
axis and just apply it as you can see here, it is pointing towards the z direction so now, if you
what i will do, i will just isolate it and right now,
so, as you can see, we have opened all the parts and now we have
this part which is left, so i will just select this and isolate the same
select the faces by selecting, shift selecting
and now, go to uv and here you have the planar as you can see it is pointing
towards the z direction so, i will go to z and apply and now we’ll go to uv and uv editor
just select all of them
go to uv and here we have the planar so now, it is projecting from the y, x direction so i will
if i go to the uv and uv editor as you can see, we have still that particular shape because
so, this part need to be shut out it i will go to uv and just off this checker select this points
and shift select this one just move it and just select this one move it here
as you can see, the square which is forming here is quite well but this portion,
we don’t have to shut out it because we will just copy this and we’ll just put it somehow here
we have to open this and now what i will do, i just go to face and will select this part,
three of them and will go to the uv and here you have the panel so, i will select
this and as you can see, it is pointing in the z direction, so i will just apply it okay
now, at first i have to manage this, so i will just move it somehow here
and after that, what i will do,
i will just go to uv and just select the points like this part and just pressed a new and just
move here, is the top part and this is the center of it same with this one,
﻿hi everyone so, in this session i will just do the texturing here as we had
this one that part and basically if i go to the face, just select this one,
okay so, that’s the main thing and this is the side one no problem right click uv
okay and now, we will select all of them, image
and take a snapshot dam base underscore zero zero one,
and apply and close we’ll go in to the desktop, again we’ll just
go to the desktop and just back, that’s the base so we’ll just select this
and just move it somehow here, okay make new layer, move it at the down and alt backspace
to fill the black color, so that the lines will visible it and rasterize the layer press b for
make sure that it came nearby and after that do the alignment
okay now, one more thing we have to do i’m going to the clone tool and here we have
planars like, this one so, what i will do now, at first i will just go to new and
going to therefore, okay, no problem and if i just paint here, we’ll make a new layer
you can see it’s forming some tiles so, i will increase the opacity,
okay as you can see here,
so what i will do, i will just select randomly
okay, i have selected randomly and we’ll go to the level and just increase the value as you can see
well, so we’ll select both of them, merge layers control t and now we’ll just
small this up, control z
fine, and just crop the same data
we’ll select all of them and just press r, and just scale it down, okay so, you can see, we have
now, what i will do again, define pattern,
here we have the dam base and now just off this for a while
okay as you can see, we have painted but it is not looking
realistic so, what i will do, i will just select this
going to the normal, click here and just move it we have to blend it at first
right click, assign new material but at first, we’ll just off this, object mode
just scale it down and just zoom this out and one more thing, here we have the problem that it’s
so, as you can see, we don’t require to just have in this part because what i will do, i will just
control d and just duplicate the same so, we don’t require that part that’s the main thing
now, we have this part and this part and after that,
getting overlapped, okay so, what we’ll do, we’ll have uv shell and just click here, and just move
it somehow here click here and move it somehow here, okay like this we will arrange the same
data we are in uv shell mode, so i will just put all of them one by one and then i will just see
that which part will go afterwards and now, if i select this part,
this is the side part, as you can see here, that’s the side part that’s the back part,
that’s the front part so, i will just put this one and this one here, okay this one,
already did the uv unwrapping in the previous session, so in this session i will just mainly
that’s the top and maybe at the bottom, no problem, we’ll just put it somehow here
so like this part, this is the bottom one, okay, we’ll select over here and this one,
this should be go here rotate the same
and select this part, move it in between them
you can see, we have aligned it select all of them and scale it up a little bit
we are at proper vision of the data, so that would be fine and just select and just move it
somehow here, okay now, as you can see, we have just aligned it and make sure that whenever you
are working, you should have a copy so, i have already make a new copy and then also i will just
make some copy because the version is very important, okay so, underscore zero zero four
okay, continue now, as you can see, we have just
put the painting over here and also we’ll just complete the same and we’ll just duplicate it
used the alignment and after that we’ll just select this and we’ll go to the image and here
we have uv snapshot so, right now i am using two seven eight eight png would be fine and desktop
created in the desktop, dam underscore zero zero one, just move it to the photoshop
and we have some cement texture so, as you can see, what else you have to do,
just click a new layer or backspace and now just put one texture maybe this would be fine
and just move it somehow here there is a seams which is generating here so, i don’t
require this seam so, what i will do, i will just go to the clone tool and just right click
rasterize the same and make sure that you have to load the opacity, it is very important
and just with your bracket button, with your right bracket button,
as we’ve discussed that this part should be duplicated here so, let’s get started
it will increase the size of the brush and with your left bracket button, it will decrease it,
okay by pressing alt, you can click over here, take the reference, paint it somehow here,
okay just click click click, so that it just produce a proper blend texture don’t use to just
paint like this you always use click button so that the texture will blend betterly
and as you can see, now it is looking quite well, not bad at all and just select this
texture only and just move it somehow here, okay as you can see, there is a huge amount of
you can say the seams which is generating okay, no problem we’ll just select both of them,
right click merge and just select this, and just move it somehow at the top, okay
make sure that whenever you are cloning something in the photoshop, always use the
click button to clone for the same okay and don’t paint anything in the zero layer,
now, what i will do, i will select this part and at first i need to do one more thing, going to
because that’s the uv layer which we have extracted from maya, okay so,
as you can see there is a problem, so i will just put it somehow here and just paint the same,
okay so, we have to just put it all across our seam so, i just making it more seamless,
as you can see here
and after that, select all of them, merge layers,
select the clone select it and just paint it like this random painting would be fine
make sure that we’ll not work in hundred percent opacity, otherwise it just produce a jerk
and using the soft brush for that, you can change your brush from here,
so i am using the first brush which is the soft brush
shading and here we have wireframe on shading so at first, if you just go to the wireframe on
okay now, as you can see, we have some parts which is here and here so, what i will do,
i will just go to the panel and just put some random texture as i will move here and
just put some amount of random textures, and with the help of this, put it somehow here
that’s the random and,
so one more thing you can do, instead of using this texture, i will just put this one in the
separate panel as you can see, i will put in the separate panel and what i will do, i will just go
to the clone tool as you can see, we have pattern tool also and when you click on the pattern tool,
it form a new pattern at the top, okay so, what i will do now, i will just go to the edit and here
we have defined pattern so i will just make a new pattern, okay the same, we’ll cut this off
and we’ll just go to the pattern stamp tool and decrease the opacity as if you click over here,
shading as we have discussed that if you don’t select also then the wireframe will be shown
it will form at the last, so that would be fine so, i will just make some pattern like this, okay
so, i don’t have to just go to have the image
and just paint for the same i just make some pattern like this that would be fine
so, as we have completed then we’ll just start working on the
color correction and all later wards
so, as you can see, we have painted all the things in the photoshop and what i will do,
i will just go to this tool or even the laso, polygon laso tool, and just select
part by part, as you can see, we have this part,
no problem and i will just select this part, go to uv and we’ll just paint one by one,
and now, what i will do, i will just make a new layer which is the level,
adjustment layer and just drag this down, okay so, you can see and after that,
control, control z because i think here we required both of them
here also
make level again
so, as you can see, we have found this i will just rendered the same data, control shift s,
on shading, i’ll select this part, click over here, and go to file, click over here
okay so, i have this part so, as we have discussed that the uv should be aligned here,
like this way, you can paint all of them and when you are satisfied with your work if i press
three, then the shape has gone so, what else we have to do? as you can see here, we have many many
things like this and this also i will just put some random edges like going to next two line,
just insert some edges so, when we just use the smoothing, it will not smooth so much,
okay if i press three, as you can see
by focusing this part only three,
so you can see, smoothing quite well not the upper one, but the lower one because
it has proper segment here but not there so, like this way you can work if it has proper segment,
definitely it will smooth the same data, okay so right now, i am just removing all the
segments, control s to save and now, we’ll just select this part uv, uv editor
what happens now we will just select all of them by going to uv and just select at first just
hello everyone
control d*, move it here
and specially this part
if i press three, what happens?
see
so, we’ll go to insert edges, okay
one thing is that we have to just first select the faces
insert edges
insert some edges
and after that we’ll just move it and just enlarge it
getting stretch, no problem
okay, just press three
examine the same
fine
and just select this part
i think, also have to select this one
so, what i will do, i will, just go to insert edges and just put some edges randomly
and just move it forward, okay
so, that would be fine
and we’ll not use the turbo smooth here
we’ll not use the three button
otherwise it’s just form like this, no problem
but, we’ll just put it one only and, so as you can see here, we had to just go through
the insert edges and just put some edges
control g for group
and so, we had the outliner here
so, this is the group part
control d*, just move it here
and shift d, control z
now, we’ll select this part, right click, uv shell, select this and just move it somehow here
control d*
select this part, both of them
move it at the centre
this part
control d*
or you can do one more thing
hi, everyone
so, in the previous we have just setup all the things and in this session we will just
make some duplicate copies
so at first, i will just select this and as you have seen that we have just moved the
i think that’s the part, okay
p word by pressing d* here
and what i will do, i will just select this
as you can see that its facing in the x direction, which is here, in the x direction
so, i will go to edit
and here you have the duplicate special
we’ll click over here
and as you can say the scale value, which is x, y and z, which is all in minus, okay
so, i will put the x value in minus one and apply the same
so, it will just create the copy over here
and, okay
no problem
one more thing we have to do, we’ll just go to duplicate special
at first we’ll reset it and then we’ll just minus one
apply, close
so, the problem is sort outed because as you can see here also we have the minus one earlier,
so the problem is sort outed
and here, just click over here, and press d* again and just move it at the corner, okay
i think here would be fine
i’ll select this and just move it somehow here
here would be the, here would be fine, okay
now, we’ll go to edit and duplicate special
we will increase the size
click
as we have just did the duplicate special, so i will just put somehow here
and we’ll put somehow here, okay
control s, make sure you are saving a file which is important
select this control d*, move it here
so, this control d*, move it here
like this group, control d*
move it here
and select this part, control d*, move it here
click the checker
as you can see we have formed this
select this, go to the front view
first save your file
and as you can see, like this i will put, because i don’t have to open the uv here
i will just put somehow like this and we’ll do the editing in the compositing software
so, hope now you are understand the concept of uv, how you can just put the texture and
all into that
work in only one and to the copy of all
so, like this way you can work
and i will just save my file in a new scene
this would be connected, so we don’t have to paint the texture of this
continue
like this way, you can work quite well
so, we have focus this part and also the top, that would be fine
because, this part will connect to the rest of them
in previous session we had just opened the uv and also lay out the same and just putted
so, we don’t require to just take the texture
and now, what happens next, we have this part which is the this one
so, i will do just increase the size
move it somehow here, select them and just move it here, okay
that is the down part
this one specially
click and just have a look at the texture
it’s stretching
we’ll rotate this, okay
we’ll just rotate somehow here
the texture over here and here
same with this one
this is off, so we don’t require it
obviously if you want to paint, you can
and, okay that is the side one
and this is basically the back part, so we don’t require this
so, i’ll focus on this one, the top, and this one, then the side one
we don’t require to just focus on the side
this part and we’ll just put somehow here
this part also we don’t require
so, we’ll just scale it down
and so in this session, i will just put the texture here as we have already opened the
yeah, this part we require and what is this?
no, we don’t require
and, and the last one
this one
okay, so just click on the checker board
rotate the same
so, now we had a proper layout and we’ll go to uv
just select all of them, image
and this would be the side part
uv, but i have to align the same
uv snapshot, dam, side underscore zero zero one
apply and close
this one
move it to photoshop in a new tab and just go, you’re the previous file and previous
texture and we’ll just go to photoshop again
make a new
and after that what else we require, we’ll just select this part, shift and drag here
we’ll move somehow here
and after that what else we have to do, just go to the clone, clone tool and we’ll just
so, what i will do, i just select all of them and by holding uv and just select all of them
click manually
so, right now, i am just selecting this texture and just put it somehow here
just move it
increase the size
and go to blending mode, move your arrow button
you have a clear examine
just turn the opacity down
okay
so, go to maya again
and just go to press r button, just scale it down little bit and just pull it here
and the rest is i think fine
so, we’ll just select this, that’s the top part
that should be this one, darkened
okay
as here we have the gate region, so i’ll just select like this manually and just make
a new layer
click, go to level, okay
now, one more scene, control t if i just drag this, you can have more space for that
okay
and now let’s have a check, but at first one more thing i have to examine
so, what i will do now, i will just select one of the part
at first we have to just make the copy and we’ll just save scene
and, and after that what happens next, we’ll just, as you can see, you can fix this and
you know how to fix
i’m not using the back part, that’s why i just leave the back part
so, because we have scene from the front
so as you can see, this is the front part as this region, specially this one
we have to scene from the front end
we’ll extrude it, okay, little bit
some edges like this and you are opening uv, that would be very hectic
putting some edges here
now, you have a smooth result
if i press one, here a hard plus three that is smooth
select this part
so, that should be here
﻿hello everyone, welcome back to the class so, today we will discuss about the three d painting,
what i will do, i will just focus on this model and just paint it i will use this color also,
manual color and also the paint effects for that so, what i will do, i will just select this
as you can see, if i press five, the texture will be gone, because we are in shaded mode
if you press four, we are in wireframe but if you press six, then we are in texturing mode
and if you hit on seven, it would be black, because there is no light present hit on seven
as you can see, there is no light present i will just select this model and delete the same
subdivision mode which is three if you press one, definitely
you can go to the hard end view okay so, i am pressing three and now i will just
drag all those things and i need some more space so, what i will do, at first i will go to one,
and as you can see buttons are separated from each other so, right now i am not using the buttons,
but i will just paint in this area and for that, what i will do, i will go to rendering tab, as you
can see here and we have the texturing panel if i click over here, you have three d paint and tool so,
at first i will show you in a sphere, if i take a sphere, okay and just put it some more here
and if i just select this sphere, make sure that whenever you are working, you should
always just clean the history because the history we don’t required this is the sphere,
right click assign new material and i will just put lambert okay, no problem as we’ll off the
texturing with the third party render engine in maya application as you have now a clear
attribute editor for a while just select this sphere, go to texture and here you have the three d
paint tool instead of clicking over here, i’ll go to its property features as you can see,
whenever i just click, the window will come just left of your screen okay
so now, as you can see, we have some sort of brushes which is present over here
we have scale and width value also we have paints effects and this one, this is the gate to brush
that’s the color, that’s the floor so, we’ll discuss it one by one
and we have lots of more features few of them are hidden because we haven’t taken the brush
so, i will start from this, soft brush as you can see, i am going here in the new model, it is not
updating and it is not working, as you can see the brush pointed is just forming the cross sign
that means it will not apply on your model, okay so, what happens now, if i go down as you can see,
idea about how you can generate uv maps and how you can work with a uv editor in maya software
we have file textures you have to define the proper space where your texture want to go
and where your texture will save and where it will generate some cache memory
so, file texture is very important assign edit textures just click over here
you have assigned edit textures so, i will increase the size by default the value would be
around five twelve so, you can increase this so, i have just increased by
two thousand forty eight, okay fine and the image format which is maya f,
so i will change it to jpeg that will take little amount of time and do assign edit textures, okay
now, as you can see, it has been updated and it’s not producing any kind of cross sign
so, here we have the color click over here, you can have all the colors which you want to paint
you have the second, first the primary color and i will just change the primary color
so, in this session, we will discuss, how we can directly paint on to the model
so, whenever you are painting, you will found that it will overlap on your model, okay
if you want to paint, you can definitely, if you want hard brush, you can have a hard brush
if you want the corner soft brush, you have the soft if you have the faded brush, you can have,
okay there are different mode scenes like if you are painting like this, if you go down,
and you have the blur so, if you click over here, you will found that
it will just allow you to blur the same as you can see, it will allow you to blur
that means, you can have the freedom of having fully painting things
so now, it is just blurring your you are blurring your whole painting if you go to paint, if you
want to erase, you can just put it over here it will erase off your file which you have painted
okay so if you want to increase the brush size, definitely you can increase from here
with the help of several brushes available into the maya software let’s switch to the
but for the shortcut, if you press b and hold your left mouse button and just drag,
you can find that the radius of the brushes gets changed
now, you can just erase all the things which you have painted,
okay and we’ll just press b and just drag your left mouse button again and we’ll go to the soft
brush and i will go down and just go to paint, okay so, here are much more things if you want
to just add some images, you can add from here, okay if you want to add some painting effects,
you can add from here and few of the given here which is this one, this is the vicer part
so, here we have the paint effects so, as you can see, these are the small presets which is formed
here and which is always been there in the maya so, if you want to work for any of the preset,
you can work as you can see, here we have the flowers, flower mesh and all if i just click
over here, and we’ll just close this for a while, and as you can see, it will update on your sphere,
okay there is a seams in between them because the image which you are painting
is been the over from this position and we’ll start from there so, that’s the seam okay
like this you can paint easily, whatever you are going to paint you can also add some colors, that
means you have to go to this brush, click over here again and just paint the same, okay, control
z i will click over here now, if you need little bit of randomness you can just paint like this,
okay so, it depends on you that whatever you want to paint, you can definitely paint and the
next tool which is the paint operation, the paint erase clone blur will all effect in this as you
can see, it is effecting on your screen and also it will effect your vicers which you have taken,
which is the presets this is the blur intensity if i increase
hello everyone, so in this session we will learn about the process of three d paint and texture
this to twenty, it will just have a huge amount of blur, if i decrease this by three, it will produce
some small effect of blur on your painting so, if i just increase this to ten, it would be fine,
okay so, it depends on your that means you have to keep on changing
and after that you have the stroke, okay stamping space if you are painting something like i have
taken this brush and also if i paint, as you can see, if i go downward, which is the stroke,
if i just increase the value, what happens? you will found that the points is forming because
the continuity has been breaked so, if you just click like this, the value is
zero point zero and if i increase this little bit, now it forming some sort of points so, i
pressure if you are using the pen tablet, you can just put this stylish pressure on and you have
inside maya application so, as you can see, we have this model so, i will just do the
the display, which you have seen here drawing outline, okay, drawing brush feedback okay
that means it will be shown in the viewport no problem and here we have same thing which
is assign edit textures and if you want to save your texture as a proxy file, you can definitely
click over here and just define a particular path your file will be saved right now,
i have just selected this part at first then if i click over here, it will definitely go to my
document folder of maya, okay so, paint operation its fine and you can change from
anything if you want to erase, you can erase and these all things are painting in only one
layer, okay so, you can erase, or even clone or even blur that depends on you opacity,
definitely if, if i just click over here, and just make some new color, like red and if i click,
as you can see, the color is very harsh if we just decrease the opacity, as you can see,
three d paint and texture in this model so, if i select this, if i press three, as you can see,
it is getting affected, okay like this way you can work
now you can see, it is really getting affected so, this is the hundred percent
this has been decreased and this is much more decreased so, i will just put it one,
which is by default present in maya and you can say hundred percent, okay like this so you can
have some sort of brushes this is the projection brushes you can just click over here and just put
some images if you want but, you have to take the images from, from the image folder, okay
so right now, as you can see, we have a couples of different things
if i go to print effects, and if i just go here, you have pastels, paper,
you have that’s tree, tree mesh and all the things which you want to make, okay so right now,
the model is simple and also it has the shape, and also the polygons are smooth because, we are in
hi everyone
and if you go out, it will just stop, because we have applied this one to here
and after that just go to assign edit texture, same, edit texture
and now you can have the freedom to just a proper painting eo model and you can achieve
a good result with simple painting inside maya application
so, let’s meet to the next session
and now what i will do, i will just press three for some division access
or even you can go to one and after that, we’ll just go to the rendering tab, as you
can see here in rendering tab
and at first you go to texturing, here you have the three d paint tool
so, i will click over here
and now as you can see, we have this painting which is not applying any model that means
just go down and you have the assign edit texture, click over here
its size is which we have taken two thousand forty eight
and this is in a square, okay
so, assign and edit texture, okay fine
so, in this session we will learn about how you can paint the three d texture and how you can
define and as you can see, if i just paint, it will just allow me to paint in the model
so, that’s the main thing
if you press three, sub division access happens, so don’t worry about the scene
what i will do, i will just paint some textures over here
so, let’s start
so, i will just click over the color
and just paint somehow little bit of pinkish, like this one
and what i will do now, i will just press p and hold my left mouse button and just increase
the size
so, i will just paint like this at first
just put the texture over here with the help of maya
as you can see, if the model is been separated from each other, then means, that means you
have to just select that model scene go to texture and three d paint tool
if your uv is not been open it will produce some amount of problem, as you can see here
so, you have to just keep on just driving your brush, then it will be sort outed, but
make sure, whenever you are working in any of the file, you should have opened the uv
at first
because, you know how to open the uv
and as you can see, we have just painted the texture over here
each and every part is kept spendthrift
so, i’m in maya two thousand eighteen
and now, we’ll just press v and just drag your left mouse button to give you the size
what i will do, i will just go here and have this particular one
so, here we have a different things, like whatever you want to just make, you can definitely,
you have to just go through the same and just pick any of them
so, i’m picking the this one, this is the flower, so i will just click over here
and as you can see the opacity is hundred percent, which is one point zero, okay
i will just put some amount of flower here and we later change it
here, we will put some amount of random flower like this
spread these thing some amount of seems there, no problem
so, at first i will just select the model and just go to the edit and here we have the
so, like this flower i have just putted and after that i will just go to the top, click
over here and have some different material
so, i will go to the flower wheel, have some shot of flower mesh also with this just at
your screen
so, we have this flower
so, you can put it anything if you want to put that means, if you just want to put that
thing, you can just click like this
definitely it will just allow you to just put on your model
so, as you can see, the part which is not open in uv is getting print out, that means
the opening of the uv is very important
delete by type stream
now, i’ll just put like this, no problem
you have to open the uv at first, then you can just work for the same, like this way
and for this, i can use the simple texture
and as you can see, there is a strip line, so i will just go to the brush again, click
over here and just go to the table* of art improve
i have to define just the shape, so i will just select the heart brush and now, what
i will do, manually i will just go to b and just drag this down and i think this will
so, i have just printed this part which is the rough part
i, you can just paint well with the help of proper uv opened and then you don’t have
so, i will clean the test <?> </?> first and then i will select the model right click,
just about the problem which we are facing here
so, as you can see here, also we have some problem, you can just do it well
click over here if you need to add the color
click and that color has been added, you can just drag it like this and just press b and
at first just increase the size, just drag it like this, definitely it’s going to work,
as you can see
you have to keep on painting like click and click
that would be applicable
if you want to just paint in this part, you can have to paint and for this part also,
you just go to color and just go to that particular color and just click over here
and here you have the assignment material
click here, somehow here and just press b and just drag it out, you can just paint like
this
so, if you open the uv, as you can see, there is a problem here
you have to just click and click
then you don’t have to find this type of problem
so, it’s facing right now, okay
with the help of painting, you can just achieve a good result and with the help of a simple,
you can say, simple modification of your brush, you can have a good, as, as you can see here,
we have the clone angler and all
and here we will go to the lambert
so, as you can click over the blur, you can blur this out easily
so, we have discussed this in previous session
so, you can just blur this out easily and you can work for twelve with the help of the
modification which we are having here
so, with the help of this common features, you can just do it well
so, hope you understand this, the concept of this painting
if you want to just select any other model, just select that model and do one more scene,
right click, assign new material and lambert it again
so, later to be separated, that would be fine texture and three d paint, click over here and
same what we have did it, click and it’s not replying
so, that thing has been assigned
﻿hello, welcome back to the session so, today we will discuss about the most important thing
you want to hide, you can hide your thing or double click, you change the name if you
want to or even you can just put the color so, when you are hiding,
okay, that thing will be changed so, right now, leave it here and so whatever you are
going to make, you can make in layers that would be fine and also that would be beneficial when
you are working in layer render so, what is render layers, we will have a proper class and
a separate class for layer renders so, hope you understand the concept of uv,
how you can just produce the uv map and how you can unwrap the data from the model and after that
just make one and just copy the same data, okay so, let’s continue to the next session
will just make some duplicate copies so, at first, i will just select this
and as you have seen that we have just moved the p word by pressing d here and what i will do,
i will just select this as you can see that its facing in the x direction which is here, in the
x direction so, i will go to edit and here you have the duplicate special will click over here
and as you can see the scale value which is x, y and z, which is all in minus, okay so, i will
put the x value in minus one and apply the same so, it will just create the copy over here
and okay, one more thing we have to do, we’ll just go to duplicate special at first we’ll
reset it and then we’ll just minus one apply close so, the problem is sort outed because
s you can see here also we have the minus one earlier, so the problem has sort outed and here,
just click over here and press d again, and just move it at the corner, okay
of any three d application, that’s called the render or the render setting so, whatever we are
i think here would be fine i’ll select this and just move it somehow here
here would be the, here would be fine now, we’ll go to edit and duplicate special
click, as we have just did the duplicate special so, i will just put some more here and we’ll put
some more here, okay control s, make sure that you are saving your file, which is very important
select this, control d move it here so, this is control d, move it here
and we’ll go to window and here we have the outliner select this group control d
move it here, and select this part, control d move it here
as you can see, we have formed this select this, go to the front view first save your file
and as you can see,
like this i will put because i don’t have to open the uv here i will just put somehow like this and
working into the maya application or any kind of three d application, definitely if you not follow
we’ll do the editing in the compositing software so, hope, now you understand the concept of uv,
how you can just put the texture and all into their, just work in only one and to the copy
of all so, like this way you can work and i will just save my file in a new scene
continue like this way, you can work quite well
so, if i click over here, that’s the render setting so, you found,
we are using maya software, definitely yes and you have all the features like file output which
format you want to save and i will save in jpeg and what would be the frame range so, if you are
animating something, you should just put the frame range and perspective is fine preset which is,
i think i will use ten eighty p right now and also just put it some more here,
like this and if you just click over here, you have the film gate so,
the particular proper render settings, the output would be not appropriate so, after completion of
this part would be renderable i will just zoom this quite a bit, okay if i just click over here,
you will found that the thing is get rendered in the maya software
as you can see, the thing is get rendered and yeah, we have to just adjust the light, so it
will just produce a good result so, here we have the exposure and the gamma gain value so, you can
just manipulate your thing from here also and also we have, if you just click like
this and just go here, you can click over here and just the render view will change,
okay that’s the thing where you can work for the render if you want to work here only,
that means you want to render in this part, i will just drag this and just click over here now,
now, it will render only this part, okay, not the whole one that’s the snapshot that means you will just
skip the snapshot of the particular model and as you can see, it’s generating in the
this all, generating uv maps, three d painting tools, the types of shader, now it is time to get learn
wireframe so, i will just go to the render view again and just render the same data
so, like this way you can work, okay so, here we have more features like keep image if you keep
your image, you can have a quick comparison if i just increase keep image click, as you can see,
there is only one image and how much image you want to keep, you can if i just rotate this,
and click over and have another view and if i just go here, as you can see,
we have both references at first we have keep the image and then we have just another render
so, like this way you can keep as much as image as you can, click here, so it will just have three
frames, as you can see so, the last one, i will just go here, somehow here like this
and just render the same data so, as you can see, we have three, one,
two and three so, like this way, you can keep your image
how we can go with a proper render settings so, there are several tools, several menu
you can delete your image from here you have render setting which is just
present here you have file, where you can just put your file and just call up your images you
have the view region, you have the rendering tab which you are getting here, which all came
in this particular you have the ipr, so ipr render, you can have the perspective, because
i’m working in the perspective click here and now it will generate the ipr render engine
as you can see, okay so, we have generated the ipr and you can just click and just refresh the
ipr image so, as you know that ipr stands for the interactive photo realistic rendering, which
is only available in maya so, it will produce some amount of photo realistic rendering but,
you have to undergo through lighting on many various textures also so, we will discuss
this step by step, okay and you have the gain and gamma value, so by default value would be one
available into the maya render view so, one o one, we will discuss all the render view option
and here we have the value which is also one so, you have the display panel all channels if
you want to click the blue, it will show the blue, green, green and red rend and you have the alpha,
it will just produce the alpha channel, okay so, like this way you can work
quite well and also you have this play and pause button so, as you can go here, we have
the maya software so, the quality is custom and the edge unrealistic is low quality
if you go to high quality, definitely the timing will be more and also if you are using any kind of
motion in your scene, you can check the motion blur, which we will discuss in the animation
chapter and here you have rate racing quality if you have something which is transparent and
have glassy kind of nature, then you can check the rate racing so, if the light get bounced,
that thing will just produce some amount of effects into the nearby objects
in maya application let’s switch to the software to get better understanding how we can utilize,
so, if you click over here, you have reflection refraction so, in lighting session we will just
work for the same and here also we have ipr option, so make sure that its check
when you are working in here and if you are just rendering the same data, you have the panel, okay,
you have particular panel so, you can undergo through many changes with the help of the
maya software, the common, common is basically the where you want to keep your image,
or where you want to change the image size and if you need more exactly the more size,
you can go for four k and resolution is seventy two so, you can put it three hundred by default
the value of resolution in maya is seventy two so, if you putting three hundred, definitely
little bit time will be increased and also we have pixel inches, okay because we have
just set at this pixel inches, by default value is also been the same
how we can use the render view with the help of maya software render view settings
expect ratio would be a pixel and the maintain ratio set at two pixel, no problem
and one more thing, as you can see here, the image size is showing with seventy two dpi, and also
if you go here render using, we have this anrold render engine so, it’s a third party plugin, and
also it produce some amount of realistic render if you click over here, the panel really changes
so, it depends on your render engine so, we have separate classes for arnold render engine now, i
am just working in the maya software because it’s a basic and you have to start from here okay
master layer is fine, because we are rendering the master layer because all the things which is kept
here is the master layer, so i’m just off the grid and the you can get also, if you click here,
going to the channel box, as you can see, here you have the layer option create new layer now, you
can just click, right click at selected object so, if you want to hide, you can hide, okay if
hi, everyone so, in the previous we have just set up all the things and in this session we
hello everyone, welcome back to the class so, in module fourteen,
so, we will not focus in this, we will see laterwards
go to indirect lighting and there is the physical sun and sky
just create and when you create, in the right- hand panel you have the attribute editor
in attribute editor there are two different tabs which have been created when you created
the physical sun and sky
when you created the two tabs has opened
this is mia physical sky one
this is the sun direct
this is the coordinate points of the sun
and this is basically mia physical sky
so, now, let's switch to the maya application and have look how you can work with the ibl
as you can see here, we have our physical sky and sun
somehow over here
it's very small
whenever you are making physical sun and sky, this directional light will form
so, what you have to do press r for scale
i will just scale this up
now, as you can see, whenever we have created the physical sun and sky, final gather will
on automatically so, final gather is very important
it will just smooth enough your whole you can say your whole image, and your whole render
and to the physical sun and sky
and it will generate some soft glow and soft light into it
so, accuracy, if you increase the accuracy, definitely your quality will be enhanced and
also the render time will increase
so, now for this time i will just off this render setting, but we will do in further
you can say further experiment laterwards
so, i will just off this
now, as you can see, we have just increased the size of the directional light which has
been formed by applying physical sun and sky
so, if i entered this, i will go to view and here we have the bookmark view one
you can also use camera, but for camera we have separate tutorial you can look at it
hello everyone so, in
now, i will just render the same data, and what we will found as you can see, the image
size has decreased because we are in very low amount, low quality image
so, if i zoom this, as you can see, it's like morning light
so, i will just put over here somehow
if you just rotate this light and what you will found if i rotate like here and if i
rendered it again and what i will found, let’s have a look
now, you can see that it's get little bit of dull okay
as you can see it get little bit of dull and also when you rotate much, then it will dull
the whole scene
so, what we have else
this session we will learn about the mental ray, physical sun and sky
if you just put like this what happens, let’s see
but, at first, i will make a new version so,
we will save this file
we have already make a new version and we will make another version, so ‘great britain
scene zero zero two underscore zero zero two’
save
i just saved in maya binary
continue and if i have just rotate this particular direction of light, and if i rendered the
scene, what i will get? see
animations_1717
so, let's continue
as you can see it just gets more darker and it’s kind of afternoon light
if you rotate this, it will just rotate your temperature also
if this is <?>slantly</?>below, the arrows are <?>slantly</?> below, then what happens?
the light would be much more brighter as compared to this one you have the sharp shadows and
it is also called morning light
as you can move like this, i will just cut for a time
as you can move like this, your rendered will be more darker as compared to the previous
one
so, like this way, you can adjust
as you can see, it's getting quite darker
as you can see, we have this model and we have just putted one plane
as you can see, that it's a late evening kind of light
and also, as you look that sun is i think below here
so, it’s reflecting and it’s casting the light over here, over here also
as there is a little bit of bounciness as you can see, the upper part is darker and
the lower part is lighter
so, gradient is forming in the sky and also, we have some sort of bounciness of light
as you can see, so like this way, you can add your mental ray physical sun and sky,
it's very important
so, if you are working in one light, you should work two or three lights more, you can add
two or three lights which we have discussed earlier
at first you have to define the camera
and also, one more thing is that, if i go to attribute editor
so, you have mental ray physical sky and you have one more thing which is mental ray physical
sun
if you go to physical sun, you have the shadow softness which is just below
so, if i select this and you can go to attribute editor and here you have the mia physical
sun one
so, inside it you have physical sun attributes
by default, it is just taking the rotation axis of your, if you rotate the value will
definitely change because it's linked to it and also you have one more thing which is
shadow softness
so, what i will do, i will go to here, which is film gate and just put it so whatever come
so, by default it is one
so, if you need a little bit of you can say soft shadow, so you have to just increase
it and what you have to do if one more thing is that if your light is just like this
if i render this <?>e</?>, what you are getting?
let's see
as you can see, it's getting quite harder and also you can say the intensity is also
high
and put somehow like this
what happens let's see
inside it, it will not render the same
see the front part is getting darker and the back part is getting lighter and also the
shadows generating here
so, here we have the light which is very much, you can say have high intensity
so, what i will do, i will just control z or even command z, if you are in mac
so, but you can just change like this and so i will just move this little bit and we'll
i think this would be fine
so, as you can see the part of the shadow
so, i will just do one more thing
it will only render this part so you have to just zoom it
we will learn about the getting familiar with image-based lighting
we just increase this a little bit
as you can see, your shadow is not so hard or not so soft
because you don't have the crease point like here or you don't have the gradient
so, if you go to a mia physical sun one which is inside attribute editor and it has sub
panel like physical sun attributes
so, here you have the shadow softness
so, what we will do, we will just increase the shadow softness, by twenty two or you
can also put some texture into the shadow softness
as you can click over here, the create render node will be formed so you can call up your
i am pressing alt and right mouse button to zoom
file or use any of the texture which is situated over here
now, i will just off this and cut the scene and we have samples also
but at first, we should check this part
what happens let's see
now, as you can see it's getting quiet
you can say merged and also it has very much <?>feather</?>
so, you can increase the part of shadow softness if you increase more, it will spread more
so, we will not increase more
and you have the samples
as you can see the grains are forming over here
after that just position your scene, so that it will render that particular part
if i zoom this, as you can also know that we are in low quality
but, if you still want to work in the grains, here you have the grains
so, what you have to do just go to shadow softness, and we have just increase it by
twenty-two okay fine
but we will go to samples for targeting this particular grains
so, samples we will increase somehow around, i think seventy
so, you can increase it according to your need
as you can see, the grains has left
but we have still little bit of grains because we are in low quality, that's why it's pixelating
so, i will put somehow like this and what i will do, i will go to view and here we have
your image
so, if you increase the samples around seventy to hundred, then it would be fine
otherwise, it will take a huge amount of time also
so, if you're increasing shadow softness, you have to increase the samples also, because
you have to trigger that particular grains
as you can see, it's softening quite well and also the grains which are forming there
is also lost
so, like this way you can increase and one more thing if you want to add extra lights
with it, you can do it well by going to rendering and you have the another lights
as you know, just click in the light and it form a new light, and you can just use it
the bookmarks, so edit bookmark, and i will just define a particular bookmark
and also make sure that whenever you're working in a file, you should at least apply some
texture
so, that it will look quite well
and also, one more thing is that, whenever you are using the mental ray physical sun
and sky, make sure that always your final gather will be on
and also, we will be on the global illumination
so, you can increase the accuracy if this is hundred by default you can increase by
one twenty to one fifty
but if you have a good pc configuration you can go beyond one fifty
so, one more thing accuracy in global illumination is entirely different as compared to the accuracy
in final gather
so, we are not using any caustics material here
so, we will not include the caustics
what is caustics we will discuss it next session
in common tab you have a few features like image format, we discussed this and also compressing
quality
compressing quality will work basically, when you are doing some renders into sequence which
is also called batch render
enable colour management we don't required colour management because we are using our
own thing and <?>own light</?> and all
after that, what we will do?
so, yeah, the size of the image is also very important and it’s resolution
so, by default which is seventy-two
you can increase this to three hundred
that means you can zoom and it will not pixelate as compared to this seventy-two resolution
and yes, maya is a vector software
but if you are using any model and you are working in a model and you are just having
the final output, it can pixelate if you are working in a model and the final output is
jpeg, png or any other format
so, indirect lighting, this tab is very important
quality, filter is <?>gauze</?> that means, the light which will eject from this source
if we change our view, then we should finally go to bookmark and here we have that panel
will bounce and filter size will be three and three okay, fine
and quality is zero point twenty five
if you increase little bit and have a look, let's have a look at the quality
we will go to view, bookmark and view one
let's have a test render
i think now it will take some time, because if you have a heavy scene, it will take some
time as compared to the single and lighter scene
so, scene is also depends on your graphic processor
if you are working in heavy scene, that means you should have a good pc configuration okay
so, as you can see, the light is bouncing quite well and also producing some shadow
so, it will jump to that particular panel which we have bookmark in that particular
as we can see because we have just implemented like
and also, we have changed the angle of the camera
it's not straight, it's tilted somehow you can say or also it is like two-point perspective
so, you can change your camera view accordingly if you just experimenting and if you need
to set up some camera
you can also add more than one view in bookmark
so, let's see how we can do it
time
so, now, we have a basic model and for a time, i will just off this and after that, we'll
that is ibl
just put some amount of surface shaders and we'll start doing mental ray physical sun
and sky
so, at first what we will have to do, just go to render settings
here you have the render using maya software
we will change this to mental ray but as you can see, we are not finding the mental ray
over here, because there are different <?>render engine</?>
so, what we will do, i will just off this and after that, we'll go to window and here
you have the setting and preferences
so, in setting and preferences you have plugin manager
so, if you click this, a dialog box will open, it will show all the plugins which is situated
and also, we will learn how we can use the physical sun and sky in maya application
in the maya
if this is checked, that means it has been loaded or if this is not, that means it will
not loaded in maya, so you can load it according to your need so,
the auto load is that whenever you just close your maya, after that when you open
it, if you check the auto load, then it will finally come
and if you don't check this auto load, that means you have to just click one by one again
and again if you are opening your maya
so, now if you go down, and here you find a option called maya to mr dot bundle
so, this is basically mental ray
as you have to just loaded it and auto loaded it
the ibl and the physical sun and sky help you to generate the photorealistic
so, we have checked both of them, that means it will load into your viewport and it will
also have a particular panel and whenever you close your maya and reopen it, it will
show okay
here we have just click both of them
now, what i will do, i will just simply close it
now, if you go to render settings, here you found a particular pre-set named ‘mental ray’
so,
as you can see, there are only two tab and if i go to mental ray, then it will increase
so, like this way, you can just put your mental ray and just open through window and setting
in preferences and plugin manager
scene whatever you if you want to render any scene <?>0:42</?> scene in daylight or in sunlight,
so now what we can do, we'll just go to indirect lighting
so, we'll see these settings laterwards
at first, we have to just put the physical sun and sky which is present inside indirect
lighting
so, in indirect lighting you have environment tab and in environment tab you have two option,
image based lighting, which we have discussed earlier and this is the physical sun and sky
so, if you go to create, now it created the physical sun and sky
so, i will close it and if you render the same data, what you will find that you will
find it is as you can see, this small tiles like thing is due to the final gather which
has been checked and we will discuss this final gather laterwards
you can easily go to the physical sun and sky option in maya application
now, you can see it’s casting your light so,
if your physical sun and sky will be off, then it will not show this amount of light
on your model so,
what we will do, we'll just close it and we'll go to render settings
if you delete this, what happens?
see, if i just rendered the same data and you will found that the light is not present
and your screen
that’s why it is quite dull
so, that means you have to just apply the physical sun and sky and the scene is totally
changed
and in ibl, when you are working into the cg object, and if you require to generate
one more thing
at first, whenever you are doing your render for testing purpose, you should be rendered
in a very low quality
as you can see here, you can have this size and also you have the rendered time
so, the size is around nine sixty and five forty
what i will do, i will just go to render settings which we have already opened it and i will
go to common tab
in common tab, if you go down, here find the pre-set which is hd five forty
so, because, we are using test render, so, i will go to minimum which is three twenty
and two forty
some bounciness of the common environment, that should be reflected onto the model
just for examine purpose, if i'm satisfied with my result, then i will increase it to
four k, which is four times hd or even i should go to nineteen twenty, ten eighty p
so, this which is around here, nineteen twenty, ten eighty p but for testing purpose, i will
image format would be <?>iff</?>
so, <?>iff</?> were working, you can work in <?>iff</?> or you can also work in exr
and for render purpose, only for checking your result, i will go to jpeg or even png,
okay but final output will be rendered in exr or even in tiff or targa
so, now, we are in jpeg and compression quality is zero
if you increase this definitely your time will increase, your render time will increase
such kind of effect we can generate with the help of ibl or the image-based lighting
as you can see, our render has done
at first, let's have a test render
as you can see, we have just used only one light
so, it's producing quite well because the shadows are smooth and also it's bouncing
some amount of light from the back
and also, from here and the front part, which is lighter dark in colour and the extruded
part this particular section is getting bounced with the light
so, i will go to settings
at first, when you go to indirect lighting and here you have the
final gathering which is accuracy, which is hundred
now, you have two views, which is view one, as we have set it earlier and the another
okay fine
you go to common tab and here you have the pre-set
so, i will just increase the, we said around seven twenty-five which is half hd
okay, fine
now what we will do is just select the slide, we'll go to the mia physical sky one
so, we have the multiplier which is five
or this is this part three twenty-two forty
we have a test render
let's look at the exposure value of the light
one is view two
select this part and just move a little bit like here, and a have a look
so, we have just settled this thing and one more thing we have to do
as you can go to bookmark one, this part needs to be filled
so, i just want to do one more thing, we'll select this particular section, especially
this part
and when you selected if i press control, it will deselect
if you have selected anything by drag, it will select the other parts by holding control
now, just put it over here and we'll go to bookmark view one
and let's have a look
so, you can switch accordingly
just put in a little bit like this
so, because we don't have to focus in the crown part, as you can see it's floating on
the surface
okay, fine
we don't have to put some model over here because it's not looking
so, it's only for having a good knowledge for you so that you can work in your model
so just for that thing, i just put the model at the top and exporting, there is no nothing inside
you can just make some models here
so, it's not showing in the viewport
let's have a look at this section
it's fine, quite fine
we'll select this slide
we'll go to attribute editor and here you have the mia physical sky
let's increase it by one only
so, i put one and have a test render again
because if you are satisfied with the work, just do some test render, that would be better
and after that when you're done with it, we can just finalize it
so, as you can see what we have to do, i just off this
so, as you can see, we model is looking quite well
we will select this will rotate this little bit, here and let's have a look
hope you understand the same
let's meet to the next session
we haven't used any texture which is by default present in maya
we have just used it which is lambert and also the light is also bouncing, a good amount of light
see, we have the soft shadow and we have just used only one light
you, have to use more than one
you have to just examine the parts
and here we have the size and the render time
if you are getting darker area, you can use any light over here
so, i will left this thing to you
so, you can add extra lights
now you have the idea about both which is image-based lighting or the physical sun and
sky, which are both come under mental ray
so now, one more thing is that, if you want to do some tweaking, you can go by selecting
this part and you have this
you can increase the multiplier as you can, as you want to increase this work light intensity
which is one, if you increase by twenty, what happens?
let's have a look
so, we are using mental ray
as this is the previous image so,
now you can see your images getting burned
so, increasing the multiplier will affect your scene, especially see your image gets
burned, fully burned
so, don't use multiplier too much
if you are in one make sure that you will increase or decrease
if you are decreasing then you should at least take zero point five, zero point three, or
zero point eight according to your need
or if you're increasing, you can use one point five two or even one point eight, two point
two like this
so, by increasing so much it will burn up your whole scene
so we’ll not increase this amount
and as you can see, your whole image gets burned
we have to just make sure that you will decrease the value of multiplier
by default, it is one point zero
so, i will just off this and i will just put, let's see zero point five that means zero
point fifty
and have a look at this particular section
this is the previous file which we have rendered, and now if you are using zero point five,
what happens?
and just change it like somehow like this change
see, the part the particular section is getting dull, and also there are small you can see
the details which gets extracted from light and you have this soft shadow which we have
worked in attribute editor inside mental ray physical sun
and inside that, you have physical sun and, we have just done the shadow softness and
also the increase the sample
so, like this way, you can add your light and also you can add extra multiple lights
and whatever you are making, you should have put particular texture
so, it would look fine and always use soft light and soft glowness that will just add
so much of detail to your particular scene
and it looks a little bit of, you can see real also
so now what we will do will increase the multiplier as by default which is one point zero
and also, we do some more tweaking inside the render settings and inside the mia physical
now, we will just quick apply some surface shaders in this module
and let's examine as you see that we have created this light and what we'll do?
just select the parts, all of them in this part, right click assign new material and,
we'll use the i think, we use the lambert only
and also, we'll go to colour and we'll put some amount of yellow colour like this
we go to view and here you have the bookmark and just go to edit bookmark and here you
blend and we will increase the colour
that we can select multiple, right click assign new material
so, we are using lambert here and now we change the colour
so, we'll apply in this also
so, at first, i will go to file and here you have the save scene
so, i will make a new version
select the last part
we edit this underscore zero zero three
as you can see, our file type is maya binary
have the, g and name it view, view two or you can name according to your
so, we will just put on save and continue
now, we will just put some texture over here also
we will select the file by holding shift button and right click assign new material, lambert
and we’ll change the colour of the lambert
so, we need some amount of shininess
assign new material
we will change the colour
comfort so, add to shelf after that apply
not this plane
go to set limit area, so input lambert only, select this part also
now, we will choose this part, and also this particular section
select all the parts one by one
now we go to assign new material and we will change the colour as you can see, we have
put the same colour
so you can change it and right click object mode
so, we'll go to view, and here you have the bookmark control s to save the file and now
have a test render
so, we have to increase the exposure value of physical sun and sky
just close it
hello everyone, welcome back to the class
so, with the help of mental ray, you can use how you can generate the caustics, when the
light bounce through any kind of class, or the extra refractive surface
now, let’s switch to the maya application and have look how we can generate the caustics
in maya application, with several mental ray parameters
hello everyone, so today in this session we will learn about how you can generate the
caustics inside maya application, so, let’s gets started
as you can see i have selected two models and i have applied a simple texture with the
surface, and also i have increased the transparency value
so, now as you can see it’s getting quite reflected into the surrounding and also it
has some short of shininess
so, in this class we will learn about the generating caustics and the lighting with
so, i will cut this for a while, and i have just stated some basic parameters for caustics preparation
i have this thing and also i have two different objects which is just front of it
so, i have a ground and also a light which is just focusing in it
so, i will just go to the assign existing material or even i can go to the this particular material
so, i will just go to the render and click over here and have a render view
so, as can see the render view is quite happening and also we have some sort of bounciness over here
and we have this panel which is phong, and also we have the colour
so, i will click on the colour and here you found a panel, and will just go to file and
just go to the file pad
third party render engine
and in image name you have the texture, so i will just put a normal texture
and as you can see will go to place two d texture and will repeat the uv
so, i think i should use fifty and also i should use fifty, so now its getting tiled,
and also you can increase the this value as according to your need
if you need to increase more value, you can also just increase the value, and also you
have to just think about, if this looking good or not
otherwise, you have to just open the
uv editor so, right now i am just making a test render, so hope it look good into your screen
as you can see it’s taking some time because as we are in mental ray panel
so, definitely it goanna take some time, if you are switching from maya software to mental ray
third party render engine means indirect lighting illumination render engine
its time will be increased because definitely mental ray is heavier as compared to the maya software
so, the render is quite good, and i will cut these off for a while, and will select this light
this is a point light or a spot light, you can say spot light, you can change the light from here
and we are in mental ray tab, and in mental ray tab you have also caustics and global
illumination, which is by default off
so, click on emit photons and the photons is on and also just check the render view,
and also you can find that the render is happening quite slow
you have to just click on the snapshot and take this snapshot and just re-render it
if you want to do a quick comparison, you can take this snapshot
for example, you can use the mental ray as well as you can use the arnold render also
now, i will go to outliner and here we have the point light, and also we have to adjust
the point ray somehow here
because i have to generate the caustics, it’s also affecting on your viewport
and if you press seven, definitely you can see the light and all the things
but, i think i can do it in six by pressing six or five, even because i don’t need to
just increase the capacity of my viewport
because if these things happened, definitely it will take some time or otherwise your system
get hang up
so, i will increase the intensity by zero point five, decrease the intensity a quick
comparison into a particular
in future whenever you are going to work in with the production of pipeline, you may have
frame i have selected only this part and looking quite good as compared to the previous one
so, i will close this thing off, and also will select this light and use the photon
intensity little bit of it
quite in a good manner
so, just go to render settings and in quality and have the indirect illumination lighting,
so, will generate the caustics clicking over here
as you can click all the panels will be highlighted, because at first its get off and now you can
have the caustics photon, which is off in this panel
one more application called the vray also
and if you just click on here, you will find that it will not change, definitely it will
not work with it
because we have to own these caustics and after that what else we have to do, let’s
have a look
will just click over here, select the light and just i think we have to just increase
the caustics is generating quite well into the crown, and also you can increase it according
to your need
because now you can have the idea that how you can just increase the caustics, and by
simple tweaking some of the parameters you can do it well
but, here because it’s a fundamental or you can say the intermediate sessions of the
and you can increase this photon intensity accordingly, if you need to increase definitely you can
and i will just cut this off for a while and take a sneak, a snapshot, and for having extra
things you have to just quick comparison between them
because comparison is very very useful, and i just put it lambert only in this crown
and just click over here and just click over here for a touch render view, for having a
good render result
let’s see what happens inside the lambert
as you can see, it’s reflecting definitely as the ground part is quite brighter as compared to the
previous, and also the light which is bouncing here is glowing quite well
so, with the help of this you will have good idea that how you can change the panel, and
animation, so here we will learn about one of the render engine in between the same that
how you can tweak between the panels for the caustics
please click over here and just render it according to your need
now, this time i have just increase the size of the render, it’s rendering quite well
and also you have to save the file for a good result view, so, i will just save the file
so, now hope you have the idea how you can generate the caustics inside maya application
so, let’s switch to the next session
is the mental ray
﻿hello everyone, welcome back to the class so, in this stage of production pipeline will learn about
and will select the top part and will delete the same, and i will go to edge and will double click
and will select whole loop and will go to mesh, edit mesh, and here you have the extrude
click, press w and will move further, now what i will do now? i will go to extrude again
and by holding r button i will scale it down little bit will move further,
and after that what i will do i will go to mesh and here i have the panel fill hole,
so it will hole the cap and now i will delete this part and will delete the same,
will delete this part also because i don’t need i think we don't need this segment here,
object mode and here i have the base, so we have to give some amount of thickness
at first i will just off the grid
the rigging in maya application hello everyone in this session we will model a particular lamp,
insert this down a little bit, and edit mesh, extrude again at the top
no worry, we will change it laterwards, we will go to front press six or five or six because we
are not in texturing mode and will just drag this thing like here, and will drag like this
what i will do now? i will just right click,
assign new material like this, we will assign a particular material from here but, at first
i have to complete the whole model, then i will assign the material i will use phong e or phong
because these have luster and shininess followed by glossiness in it so, we will apply this
one of them and will apply some sort of texture also so, i will now on my grid and the base has
been made, and now what i will do i will make it a stick part, so only we will just drag this box,
which is an inorganic model and we will work on its bone structure, that means we will rig
and we will duplicate again control d and what i will do? i will select both of them, and just
have a look that it will alive or not or not it can work, so i when go to top view, will select
this part and will move here select this part will move here, and we will select both of them,
go to mesh and here you have the combine so, now both of them are combined with each other
so, for rigging what i will do, at first select each and every part and
go to modify here you have the center pivot, so it will align this pivot to the center
now, we will add a light, this would be the light, so will add somehow over here
that is fine will increase its size
the same, so let’s continue for modeling, i will go to polygon and after that i will go to
if you have problem with this axis, then you can press your plus key to enlarge it, or you can
thing like here, and will put it over here will put take this and will shift it over here,
somehow here, and now what i will do i will just rotate each and every part one by one,
make sure that you are saving your file so, i will make a new folder, the
one, so you have to make the version which we already discussed earlier and now
so for animation what i will do, if you press insert button you can change its pivot,
so i will put pivot over here, and will select this and will put pivot over here
polygon tab here at first we will change this to polygon, so i will simply make a model
you can have modification like this, so
i have a rotation like this and have a rotation like this so, now our model has been completed,
and what we will do, we will just select all the parts and will go to assign a material and here
we have the phong, and what i will do now? i will go to attribute editor here you have the phong
and you should go to colour, and i will just pick the lightest colour and now i will just select
this part only, will put assign new material another phong and we will put some amount of
like this so, you have a design
and, and now i will just select this part, will go to assign new material i will put blinn
now, will save the file and will start working on rigging, so before rigging
of lamp so, what will, i will do now? i will just drag a cone and will press five button
what i will do i will just select all the part and go to edit here you have delete by type history, so it will erase up
it history history will be deleted and after that will align in the center, if you look that you’re
all the panels is changed so, what i will do, i will do now
just select the part and here you have freeze transform what it will do? it will just
take all the coordinate system and will put zero freeze transformation, now you can see all the parts is zero,
only the scale value is one so, we have turned the freeze transformation, and we have
cleaned the history also so, you can’t found any history, only three things is there, the texture,
its property feature and its attribute editor so, only this amount is have, because we have
just deleted the history, and we have just used the freeze transformation so…
and here if i go to a channel box layer editor, then i have inputs panel which is polygon one
and i will give the cap segment around two, and what i will do now i will go to height,
i think we need height at least two, two is fine, and we don’t need this amount of subdivision axis
so, we will make it as twelve, so as you can see, we just found this thing, and what i will do now? i will go to face
﻿in module number nineteen we will learn about introduction to bone setup and the joint setup
bones now what i will doing, i will not go to this view, i will just go to left or front
so let's focus in this view and now i will go to animation and after that we'll go to skeleton
here you have the joint tool, if i click here, now i will make the bones, click, click,
click, click and click, enter as you can see
we have just made this bone for the feet and this is for the knee, this part basically for shoe
so if i press six, our bone will be lost because it's inside the model so, what we have to do,
we will go to shading and we have x-ray joints now you can see properly,
the joint is showing or you can also click over here,
click x-ray joints now you can easily touch up your joints and we have to modify it if i press
insert now we can modify it because modifications is very important this things will be lied here
in maya so, easily you can rig the character and here we will also learn what kind of things
and this will go upward little bit of it and we'll press insert again
so now, we will go to the front view what i will do just now pressing sticks
and will select the bone and will move here
so, little bit of adjustment we require so, we will adjust in perspective, x-ray joints
or you can also do it by shading, here you have the x-ray joints panel so i think this part
now we have to focus on the spline, so for spline again go to joint tool and
as you can see here this is the parent bone, because we have made it and we have just started
from here and it will just follow the bone so, if you can select here, this are the children,
this are the children, and this is the parent so make sure that whenever you make this spline
we should keep into the mind whenever we are going to draw the joints or the bone in my application
you will start from downward direction, because we don't require from upward because we have to
just make the pelvis as a parent bone so i will click, click, click, click
okay we will make modifications later wards, click and click so, this is for head region,
this is basically for the face, this is for neck, this is for shoulder and this is the spline
one thing you have noticed that this is being curved because our spline is curved little bit of
s- shaped, so we will just make this spline also in s-shape so that would be better
so now, i will press insert and will adjust it like this way, will adjust it
here and we'll just move here we'll select this part will move here,
i think it's working quite well and we'll press insert again
now, let's switch to the software and have look how you can work onto the biped frigging here
now, it's in the centre
oh it's displaced, so no problem okay now, what we have here,
we will just duplicate this bone later wards we have to focus on the hand,
make sure that you will make a new version so, i will go to save as, will make a new version,
and now i will go to top we'll press six button for shading view
and i will just go to shading and x-ray joints so now, i will focus on the hand so,
i will make the left part so for that joint tool, click, click, click
so, as you can see, we have made it
hi everyone, so, in this session we will make the bone structure of this model
and joint tool, click, click and click, enter
click, click, i think two is fine so, what i will do now, i will just select this bone,
go to channel box, we'll decrease it's radius by zero point two same with this one,
because if i decrease from here, display animation and
joint size, then what happens it will decrease all of them, so i don't need that part
so what i will do, i will decrease by manually that would be better
okay, i will keep here and
i kept the size of it like zero point five, that it would be better for me, so
no problem because we have to just select this and we'll just move i think we also have to click
like zero point five so, now it's okay we'll press the insert button and we'll move up over
so, let's continue now, i have a model which we have combined it in previous tutorial
here, we'll press insert button again now, we will just select the both of them and what we will do,
we'll select this part and we'll do the p so, now it's been connected,
okay, if you press control space bar it will maximize your view so, i mean maximize mode
now, one more thing is that i have to add one more bone to it
that's going to joint tool, click and click
because it's a tedious work so you need lot of patience to do the same
that thing will move over here,
now, i have a clear look before getting into bone, you should look at your model that each and
and we'll press the insert again we'll select this part, we'll select this part p to parent it
we'll select this part, we'll select this part p to parent it now, if i press the pelvis bone,
all the bone will be selected control z and now as you can see we had just made the
bones you can do such sort of changes also if you increase the quantity of the bone that doesn't
matter, but if you can arrange it well then it would be fine so it's very important to arrange
the bone and one more thing is that this thing need to be modified little, so what i will do
instead of putting over here i will just put over here and for this i will prefer to go to insert
and will put over here somehow here, and one more thing, you have to give the
every your poly will be aligned properly and you should have a clean poly, as you can see here it
been connected, our bone has been connected and in next session we will just mirror the same in
this axis and we'll also work in the co-ordinate system of it so let's meet to the next session
and make sure that you are saving your files so again i will make a new version of it and will
doesn't have any meshing and all, it has a clean poly, so you should have a clean poly like this
so, now i will just insert some bones, will animate afterwards so at first we'll add some
hi everyone
we want in y and z, let's see, apply, it's added successfully
if this is going up, definitely is going down
so, this is a complete line
so, this is the second axis, this is the first axis and this is the second axis with world
local normal
so, z is the local normal, second axis y is the second and x is the first axis
so, now, we have just made that thing and we have also renamed each and everything into
layer because we have layers
and, in next session, we will just divide this part and we will just implement into bones
this allow you to rename quite well, whatever you select it will show up here
so, that means we will cut the body, make a new proxy and we will start working on the same
so, we will just use this model only, for that particular one
hello everyone
in this session, we will look at how we can generate the proxy model and how we can add
these bones in that particular proxy
so, let's continue
before adding proxy, what i will do now, at first, we will select this thing and make
sure that it's all combined in a single model
so, what i will do now?
i will press combine again
so, this is the outliner
so, yeah, it's combined
and now, what i will do?
i will select all the bones one by one, and i will go to animate and here in display,
we have transformed
so, we will off this particular section
so, locate local rotation axis will be off and so that we will see the bones clearly
so, i will off all the local axis, so we don't require now
so, i will just select this part and we will move out
here also we needed some of the parts
so, i think each and everything, has gone
adjust it here, we will adjust it by here
each and every axis, which we have created by display and this transform display
so, now what we will do?
we will just select this particular model and this particular one
at first make a new version and then we will duplicate the same control d so, this is
the main girl model
and what i will do now?
i will just select the main model and i will put in another layer and we will add the selected
object here and we will hide the same
this is the proxy
we will just divide the parts one by one
now, as you can see, this is the main girl model
so, i will select this part and will hide the bone and as a reference i will keep the bone
so, i will select this part and now if there is a bone, then i will remove this part and
will extract the same
if there is a bone, so i will remove this whole part
like this, i will work
so, we will go to polygon mode and what we will do now?
we will go to mesh and here we have the extract
so, let's continue
go to face, select the face here
we have to just rotate and see if you're seeing in good way or not
so, i will rename girl, and enter
so, like this we will select this file and we will do contol h for hide
panel and what we will do now?
we will go to display and here we have show all, and now we can see the hand so,
now what i will do?
i will go to animation and here i have the skin or constraint
so, we will first use the constraint
so, here i have the constraint panel as you can see here
so, this is the model and this is the bone
so, we will first use the constraint
we will on this thing
we will select the joint at first, after that shift select the shape and we will do the
parent constraint
so, we will open the window and here i will just reset all the things will apply the same
now what happens, see?
it will animate it
so, one by one we will do the same
we’ll select the polygon, apply
so, if you select it, you have numbers of couples of different things
now you can see if i rotated this our whole hand will rotated
see, because it's simulating some sort of cut moments
like this, i will animate the whole body
you can see here
so, like this way, so what i will do now?
i will just make whole body part like this
we will move this upward a little bit
so, in next session, we will do some much more at adjustment and attachment and all
after that we will sort out the mistake in part
just click it’s set of bone and this is the bottom one
this one is the
we will do the renaming process
press control g
now what happens?
you will create a new null so,
in this particular null, i will just put all the things of the model
so, select all the parts, especially this one and what i will do?
we’ll put in the null
so, i just put in the null
so, whatever i want to edit, i will just select this null and we’ll do the same because
each and every coordinate and each and every model is being displaced by its own coordinate
that’s why it is showing like this
so, let’s continue
so, we don't have to worry about
think there are buttons also, transparent
so, these are the bones
these are the camera which you have seen, this one, this one, this one and this one
so, it's all the views
this is the group
so, i will rename it called parts
if you have made the bones, you have to rename it properly
is kept over here
so, make sure that you're saving your file
so, now what i will do?
i will select one by one and we’ll rename it
so, we have to go to outliner again, and just select one by one
then select this bone and this bone has been selected and now this joint, so this is the
upper underscore body
so, we have renamed each and every part you as can see here
it is very important, because after that i will just mirror this bone to this side
so, make sure that you are saving your file and now what we will do?
we will do the mirror
so, for mirror we will use the mirror geometry and we will just flip this particular section
and the downward, this particular section over here
so, we will just mirror this particular joint of the arm, and we will put over in the right
side also and of the leg also
so, let's start, but at first what i will do?
i will go to channel works and here you find two layers, this one and this one
so, we have to just put this model in one layer and we will have to put the joints into
another layer
so, rename is very important
so, i will just select the model and by holding shift, you have to select the whole model
and what i will do now?
i will just select this layer, right click will add selected objects
now the object has been selected, and we will apply it over here
i will go to this part and we will add selected
objects so, both of them have different layers and we will save the same
if you change the colour, definitely it will change and it will show that particular colour here
so, i will rename this
before renaming, what we have to do is just go to edit
and this is the girl
so, rename is very important, as you can see
r will allow you to just freeze that particular thing in that particular layer and t will
allow you to hide that thing
so, r, this is off mode and this is t so, like this way, now you can select the bone
because r is there, click you can select now, if you click over here, it's being off
that means it is transparent
so, like this way you can work
so, i will make a new layer and select this particular one, and right now i will just
hide this
here you have the delete by type history
now, what we will do?
go to display, and here you have the transform display
so, i will just click this thing will move over here, local rotation axis
so here, you can see all the axis is showing here
now each and every axis is showing
now, what we have to do?
so, it will erase a bit history and now we have a clear model with the bones
i will just click, off this thing and we will select the pelvis region
and in skeletal, i may have one more thing is that orient joint, click over here as you
secondary axis, which is this part and the secondary axis world orient this one or this one
so, primary axis will always go up here and there, that means straight
secondary axis will go from top to bottom and secondary axis world orient will go from
this position to this position as you can see here
so, i think we have to check the alignment because that's very important
just select this part and we will do the mirror
so, make sure that you're saving your file
so, what i will do now, i will go to just window, and here you have the outliner
﻿hi everyone, as you have seen that we have just formed the bones now in this tutorial,
snap to the vertex, as you can see here so, i will snap one by one, and i will just
put some, you can say this controller at the bone so, what i will do? at first, we will save a file
as you can see, this has been thrown out from the pelvis here you can see
we’ll go to radius and will increase by three, no sorry, not three, i think one is fine
control d, shift p, and we will select one by one or i will just put the radius over here,
i will make another bone but, at first we have to just make a new layer this would be fine and
this parts
need to go up here, at selected object point now, if i
check this, all the things will be gone as you can see here, you have just hided it,
that's why it's not showing here we will afterwards open that same
we will make some much more modification and we will add extra panels to the bone,
so now, we will focus on our character and bone so, what we will do now? we have just make new
and what we will do? we will add selected object and we will just give the colour,
so that we can recognize easily and we will rename this dummy bone
decrease its size zero point seven is fine, i think yeah, it's looking quite well
if i go to open my bone, let us see okay, it's not bad so, i will select one by one
zero point seven same with this one we’ll make a new part over here
and we will take this part and we will zero point seven fine,
control d we will take this part and move to here
so that we can animate easily so, let’s start at first, i will go to window and here you have
we’ll take this part, control d and move up to
here control d so, you can see i'm aligning the bones control d and
so now what i will do? select all the bones at selected object
now, i will connect all the things one by one so, let’s start so now i will start parenting
so, i will select this child and by shift selecting will select this one and do the p,
any of them it doesn't matter whichever you want to select, this one or this one
i will then select this one and we will select this one press p parent the same
we’ll do it by here also we’ll select this one, and we’ll select this one, p parent the
outliner so, if you see the outliner these all are cameras, the four views of the maya
same and after that, we will select this one, and this one and hit p will parent the same and
we’ll select this one and this one p will parent the same now we have a complete set of bones
we will just select the child bone and we will go to skeleton and
here we have the root skeleton why i'm doing this, i will tell you later wards
and here is the root skeleton what is the benefit of it? as we are giving so much more
controllers to the feet so that we will not touch the bone and we will start working in it,
we will just put so much of controller so that we can easily touch that particular controller
and will work for the same so, like this way, i just adding a few more things so, there are a lot
of more features for the bone so, you can have all the things, see you can do parenting* to see
like this way so, now what i will do,
this is the bone where all the bones are being kept over here,
i will just hide this bone and we will open this particular bone and
one more thing we have to do, we will just select this part and we will use the ik which is inverse
kinematics as we have discussed earlier, that if i go to skeleton and we produce a joint
and as you can see this is a joint which is irregular i will just put it as front
if i if i believed that this would be the neck and this would be the spine
so, if i just select this part and we will go to skeleton and here you have ik handle tool
so, if i click here, you just find two things- which is single chain and rotate plane solver
single chain will only allow you to move in any particular direction but rotate plane solver will
allow you to move plus rotate in any direct pressure i will go to single chain solver
or rotate paint it is much more convenient, then i will touch this part
and this is the girl model and these are the default lights so, we have
and will directly adapt to this part so, as you can see here, a new cross-legged structure
has formed and inside it, there is a line and there is a compass you can see here
so, now you have the freedom to move your bone like this way, so it's very convenient
you can move your bone easily now, we will take another example let us see
now, for rotation you have to rotate manually which is very hectic okay, so what i will do? i will just
go to skeleton and here i have the ik handle tool we will select this part and we will
select this part and now, if you select, you can easily rotate or you can easily move
so, this is the feature of ik we’ll delete the same, with select the bone, we’ll delete this
so, what i will do now? i will just select this part, go to skeleton, ik handle will select
aligned this outliner and we have just renamed each and every part as you can see,
this part and not connect to this one we’ll only connect to this one now we had our ik
now, you can see our feet is moving quite well now as you can see that, we have just applied the ik
we have a lot of connection and can work easily if i select this, it's very hard to
move because we have to just follow the internal feature of the bone so, what i will do now?
i will just select this part, and we will go to skeleton again, we will have the ik
now i will connect this part to this part and now again, we’ll connect this part to this part
so, with here also now after that when it made, what i will do? next, i will just
hide our character, and we’ll open this bone
now, i have to just connect this ik to the bone so, we will start one by one
we’ll select the ik which is a child and we will connect to the bone b we
our parts are being connected with the polygon and we have just divided it so,
and we will select the internal part and select p
we will select the internal part and we will select the internal and hit on p
all the bones one by one as you can see, the foot will move so, control v again,
and here i have the nerves, you can also use ep curve tool or pencil curve so,
i will use the nerve and we will make a sphere this would be the large controller and
right click you have control vertex so, i will just give a shape,
object mode so now what i will do? i will select this bone, shift select this part
it's behaving quite well i will just grab this part we will start from the feet and
and p will parent the same now i will test this and you can move easily
as you can see, this can work quite well so, control d,
duplicate special, minus, apply
close we will select this file and we will delete the same now we’ll apply over here,
we had a bug here that's why it's happening, but it doesn't happen on your system
so, what else we have? we have a couples of different things as you can see here,
we have this thing hand and all we have this part also so, one by one i will do the connection
and for that, i will just go to top view if, you press v you can have vertex snap, i am snapping
it as you can see it align at the centre if you select anything if you press v so it will
we will do control d for duplicate now, as you can see, this part has been duplicated
hello everyone
that means each and every hierarchy will be joined by itself and maximum influence will
be five, drop-up rate is four point zero is okay
so, skin method is classic linear
so, you can change from here
but at first, i will just put over here, classic linear will be fine
so, what else we have, so, i will use the apply
after apply what happens?
i will close the same
i will just off the colour
now, as you can see that each and every bone part is has its own colour
we’ll go to corner strand and here you are the parent
why this happened?
because now it has been applied to the model and if i just click over here, and if i want
to rotate, what happens?
see, now our model is moving
but here we have the problem
as you can see at the top, here we have the problem
so, we have to sort out it one by one
here, it is fine
but at some point, there is the problem
if i want to rotate this what happens?
so, as you can see, now it is being connected
see?
there isn't any problem, but at some position there is a problem
you accept defeat, we’ll select this part
and we’ll move
yeah, you can see it gets stitched
so, there is a huge amount of problem in these shoes because the part is getting stitched
so, we have to sort out one by one, as you can see here, this getting stitched
so, each and every bone* each and every joint has its own influence value
so, what we’ll do now?
right click, here you have a new panel paint skin weights tool
we have connected this part in previous tutorial, as you have seen that this part is moving
this panel is new because we have applied this skin over the model
so, here is the new panel, right click in skin weights tool by holding your right mouse button
you can go over there
after that a brush will came, and a new panel will form right after your left size screen,
left screen
so, now you can easily see which part is getting more affected
so, like this way you can have hand, there are brushes
these are the profile of the brushes, which you can say the pre-set of the brushes
this is the smooth brush, gaustion* brush
this is the little bit of harder but its corners are smooth
quite well, as you can see here
this is hard brush, this is square brush and this is the you can say, colour brush or even
the image brush
so, this will allow you to import some file from outside
this will allow you to add some textures also and then will only allow you to do the colour
or even you can add some texture internally
so, this is the particular bone, if you select the pelvis, if you want to see the left leg
you can just focus like this
so, as you can see here, if i zoom that particular part, just a little bit of more space
white is the most effective part
if it is going, lighter grey that means the part is getting fall off
now, one by one we will do the connection of all the parts
so, if darker will happen in darker will happen that means it is the least effective
if more bright will be happen, that means the part is more effective
so white it is the most effective part and grey, lighter grey is most least, and after
that it will kill off into the model
so, we have to just define the which part needs more, you can say weight
so that each and every part will be fine
and if i go to toe, here you find that this part is affected and the corner part, the
side shoe part is also there
so, there is a problem we have to sort out it one by one
as you can see, it is affected over here also
so, one thing i have forgotten, i have to make the curve over here also and control
so, if you roll down your brush it is rolling according to your model
see, your brush thickness will roll according to your model
there are two process, how you can maximize the size of the brush or minimize the size
of the brush
here is the small size, you can say
if you want to minimize the brush, you can do it by here
by pressing over there, your size will change and your pressure will change
your value will change over here
if you need harder opacity techniques, the darker colour you will have hundred percent
which is by default one point zero
d over here
one is opacity, that means colour will be in full opacity
and if you want to lighter, you can lighter
this is the pressure of the brush, that means the tip of the brush where colour gets ejected
so, it also depend on you
so, you can change the value and for scale purpose, you should go to there
so, if you press b button on your keyboard, and just use the left mouse button, you can
increase its diameter
yeah
if you press the b button on your keyboard, if you want to increase or decrease, you should
press the left button on your mouse
so, what i will do now, i will just off my model, and we’ll start snapping it, because
and by pressing, you can drag
after that you can easily change the diameter or the radius of the brush like this
so, as you can see, there are many more panel, we will discuss the main thing and you can
also examine one by one
so, let us start and what we have we have to paint it according according to our need
and we’ll paint the same
so, we’ll start from that particular point where it is, where we get the maximum thing
so, we’ll see the pelvis region
i think this is fine
and hope you understand the same
we need our pivot to be at the centre
let us meet to the next session
so, we need the snapping, so i will just put the snapping over here that would be fine
so, in this session we’ll start connecting this thing
press v and put this snapping over here
now you find that all the parts have been connected with each other
we’ll put it somehow over here
now fine
and we’ll off the model and this pivot will go to, somehow you can say, by press v, it
will just snap the pivot to over here
so that would be better
we move somehow here and just open the model and we’ll start doing the connection
for connection, what i will do, make sure that i will make a new version and at first,
so, let us continue
we’ll connect this part
we’ll shift select with this part and we’ll press p now, this is the parent and this
is the child
so, like this way you will connect one by one select this part, shift select this part
the part
sorry and we’ll select this part press p
now, if you select this part, if you want to rotate you can see it is sorted quite well
now, select this part and select this part p select this part and we’ll select this
part p select this part and we’ll select this part p so, as you can see, whole of
what i will do now?
your model is moving
we have to connect this part
so, we’ll connect, we’ll select this part, press p now this part has been connected
we’ll select the curve after that we’ll select the joint and there is a constraint panel
so, i will just do the orient, because we need the rotation here
so, i will just do the orient
whenever you do the orient, you just click over here
this fine orient constraint option and here you have to go to the reset setting and maintain
offset should be checked
now apply
i will just select this part, press v for vertex snap and we’ll put up over here
what happens?
see, it is following quite well
select and shift, select this point and we’ll do the click
so, we can move, shift select this and apply
if it is turning into purple colour or pink colour, that means it has been applied
so, the select and can move easily, quite well
select, shift select this part, apply as i move
all the part is moving
select shift, select this one, apply
shift select this one applied and the downward direction has been applied
so, we’ll press v again
so now you had a complete model
as you can see it is moving quite well
you can even rotate the same
if you want to rotate, you can rotate quite well
now your rigging has been completed
in next step we’ll just apply this rig to that particular model and we’ll also work
in space for facial connection and all
so, let us meet to the next session
hi everyone and welcome to this session
so, in this session we’ll do the skinning process and for that what we’ll do?
and now, we’ll do the control d to duplicate it
we’ll replace this model from that particular model
so, let us replace
so, as you can see that we have created the cutting distance and cutting corners
now, we’ll replace this model to the original model
so, what we’ll do now?
so, in this layer, we have our model
so, what i will do, i will just delete this model
most thing is done, just select all the controllers, and we’ll put over here
add selected object
now, we’ll only open that particular file
we’ll put some over
i will just select it, and we’ll delete it
and i will just put it over here
so, as you can see, this model is being completed
and now we’ll open the dummy, and we’ll open the bone structure
so, at first, i will select the object and we’ll remove from a reference and we’ll
select the object
and then by shift selecting, i will select the bone, the main pelvis bone
and what we’ll do now we’ll go to animation
and here i have this skin panel over here
so, in skin there is a pattern skin
so, here is a smooth bind
why smooth mind, because we don't want rigid bind, because that's an organic character
and the polygons are smooth here
so, we need smooth bind
if you have any inorganic character, especially robot car, bike, anything
so we will do the rigid bind
but here we need smooth bind
so rather than clicking over here, i will go over here and we’ll click over here and
here is the option panel
so, there is a joint hierarchy, that is fine
if we select the first circle, after then select the pelvis, what we’ll do?
so, now as you can see, i will just start from pelvis and this is the pelvis part
and if the joint will be gone, and next joint will be found, there would be a gradient
so, like this, where you can add your paint thing
animations_2831
hello everyone so, in this session, we will do some amount of fixation in this model
as we have connected all the curves into the bone and we have also do the painting, weight
painting and all
so, what else we have to do?
we have some problems here
so, we will fix these problems, and we will look at our model
i think rest is fine
so, that is completely unnatural
i think rest is fine
so, we will just select this part and we will move a little bit here
and we have done the weight painting, which is the vertex paint and we have just connected
all the parts
so, to select the bone, what else we have to do?
we will go to the channel box and make sure that the bone is not being locked and we will
off the channel box
now, we will select the bone only
select this part, press w and if you press insert button on your keyboard, you can shift
this bone in the downward direction okay by pressing insert
so, what we have to do?
press again
as you can see, we have just shifted the bone
i will just shift this bone also, by pressing insert and we will shift this bone same with
this one
downward, that would be fine
and so, now our problem has been sorted out
and, let us see this hand also
no problem
in the corner part that means after the joints gets over, the part should be lighter grey
and rest of the problem is being sort outed
okay
as you see the rest of this is going upwards a little bit so i will just do it
select the bone, press insert and just move it a little bit
so, now as you can see, we have just fixed the part after that what you have to do just
press insert again
so, you have just seen all the parts has been done
so now, the character has been rigged properly and each and every part is fine
and also, we have all the parts which gets connected to each other
so, in next session we will learn about the blend shape
that means, it being partially lighter grey that would be okay
so, let's switch to the next session
for lighter grey, you have to just press the shift button and just paint like this and
in some shot also, if you're animating the character, if it's not fitting in this shot
you have to just paint in that particular shot also
so, it's required a huge amount of time and patience also
so, after that, the complete work will be happened
so, i have to paint this area and will decrease this area
now we have our feet, so what i will do is press control and we will just off all the
select the upper part, upper body
i will go to upper body and here is the bone
after that, we will just put the control button and we will paint because we had a bone here
and we need softness
and it’s part is going upward, so we don't need that
for decrease if you hold control, then you can decrease easily
it is working quite well, as you can see
and so, you have to define that particular area and i will just press control and just
let's check, deselect this part
so, we have a little bit of space
a little bit of whiteness, let's check at first is it working or not?
so now, you have the idea that if there is the joint that means here is the joint, you
black is the least attractive part and if there is a pure black, that means this part
have to just paint here also
and you can see your vertex is adjusting, and after the twenty joints gets over, what
you have to do?
just press shift and just paint the gradient part and this part you don't need it
so, you will press control and just paint this black
now, you have the better idea about each and everything
and you will just do it by yourself
if you can do, then you may have the practice and you can follow one by one
so, like this way, see this is the bone so this part needs to be affected, not this part
so, what i'm doing?
has been deactivate over here
i'm just pressing my control button and just painting back, because i don't need this part
to be affected
so it needs a lot of time and patience also, and then it will apply the same
hello everyone
in this tutorial we will learn more about vertex paint
so let's continue
as we have just selected this part and see it is been sorted out, because we had the
problem over here and it has also been sorted out, as you can see
ok if you select any of the control point, or if you go to paint, weight, here you have
the option called use colour ram
if there is a light grey colour, then that means, there is a small influence
here you can see that it is applying or not
the red is the most effective, orange is the least and after that it will fall, blue the
very least effective and after that it will kill
so, it's very important that you should check from here also
and if you want to edit a particular part, see if i go to pelvis
if you want to edit the pelvis then you have to also edit in the supporting edges
as you can see here, this is the edge, but it's also affecting over here
so, what we will do now?
there is the value
if you increase the value by one, then you have to press control, then it will erase
in the joints, there would be the part with which will be white and after that when the
the same, but if you decrease the value, then you have to leave the control
so, if you press the control, it will repaint
so, by increasing the value, you have to press control and by decreasing the value you have
to leave the control
so, like this way you can paint
so, we have just painted the whole model and now each and everything is fine in this model
so, you had a better idea that how you can just paint the same
if i select this part, what we are getting, see if i select this part, we have just painted
very precisely
now, you have the idea that how you can paint
joint gets over, the part should have a little bit of gradient look
each and every part is rotated quite well
by select this area, it's rotated quite well
see, each and every part is fine now
so, now we will move to morphing and we will discuss more about morphing
by select this part, it doesn't have any problem as you can see
so, each and every part is fine here
so, now we will move to morphing and for that, one more thing is that whenever joint you
want to paint, see if this joint you want to paint, go to paint tool and just select
that particular joint
how you can select?
that means, if you just apply harder white colour, then it will produce the brick type
just go to like this
if you want to paint this joint, see what happens
sometimes by default paint would be fine because we have just leave this part, because it is
quite well
if you want to paint just click by control because we have just off the value, so by
control pressing, you can paint easily
so, we may repaint it and this part is fine
after that, by shift pressing, you can call up the same
so, it's very important that you should press the control and shift by following up, if
there is the joint then white part will be there
of look
﻿hi everyone so, in this tutorial we will make a simple dynamics inside maya
so, will load this, will load all of them, will auto load it, so we will work on bifrost
so, i just loaded all the things from and will check any other thing is missing or not
i think these are fine, so will do the refresh,
bifrost which all are come over here so, we will do in nearby tutorials,
so this is the basic tutorial what i will do i just select the car,
press control g, so it grouped successfully, so its group now and what we will we do
we will just rotate it, let’s rotate so, for rotating i will press v for vertex nap
application so, we will work on dynamics and what we will do now, we have just edited this car, and
so leave it, we’ll group it again and what we will do now we will just
let’s see if it is selected or not, control z
its fine, will select the mudguard also,
by holding shift
and now what i will do make sure that you are in polygon and you will go to
mesh and here you have the combine so, now it’s all the things has been combined
and as you can see all the parts has been combined so, will select the part
and will go to modify and here you have the center pivot now, each and every pivot will
be aligned to its center as you can see so, in this tutorial we mainly focus on
what we have get we have just edited this car and we will break a pillar inside maya
the dynamics purposes, so now it’s completed and one more thing i will just select
again, and go to mesh and will combined it again because we just leave the tyre and
after get combined, what i will do make sure that you are in polygon panel, so i will just
grab a cube and will make a ground like this this would be fine,
will make a ground and will decrease its size
make sure that you will manage in any other view, so i will manage here,
so, will put the car over here we have just make the car in a tilted manner, so no problem
and at first what i will do i will animate the car, so for animation i need at least
application so, before going i will go to polygon and after that what i am getting here i will just
two hundred frames so, you can <?>take</?> over here,
enter, now your timeline is changed to two hundred frames
at first what i will do i just press s button on your keyboard, as you can see the timeline
is getting red and all the values of yours is getting red and now, what i will do i will go to
no worry, if this is going out of grid, no worry about it
so, you can also hide your grid from here, we will hide for a time, now, this would be our you can
say glass and this would be our ground so, i will just right click hold my right click button
and i will go to assign new material, and here we have the lambert and if after getting lambert,
go to render setting and here i will go to maya software it is fine and will cut the same
here you have the panel, i will go to lambert and will change the colour somehow to brown,
i think it is quite good and will select this part, and will put assign new material
i will put blinn because blinn is like have shininess, luster and glossiness,
and sorry
and will increase the transparent level
now, you can see from here i will select this wall, and what we will do we will go to mesh tool,
this is fine
and what we will do now will select this, right click go to edge, will select the whole edge and
so, before going to the same what i will do i will just go to window and here we have
detach now, each and everything is been detach
as you can go to face, as you can see that each and everything is been detach properly
now, object mode, will select this file and will go to ndynamics,
so here you have all the things which you needed so, i will select this box and will go to n mesh
make sure that you are in ndynamic panel, and will go to n mesh, and here you have the create
ncloth so, whenever you create any modifier from ndynamics, it will create a nucleus as you can see
here this is a nucleus, this is a control point and you can work with the nucleus
so, i will just select this part, go to n mesh and will use the passive collider, because it
will collide with the wall so, create passive collider and this is also be the passive collider,
so we have another nucleus as you can see here so, this is the rigid body, this is the cloth,
the setting and preferences and here we have the plug-in manager, will go to here,
i will go to nucleus of this particular section we have just imported the cloth and we have just
used the cloth over here, and will go to its nucleus will go to object mode, will go to
its nucleus, and here have a couples of different things
at first ground plane, check the ground plane and after that
there are many more thing, we will discuss one by one so, if i press forward button what happens?
it will collapse at first, the car haven’t be hitted,
but still it is getting collapsed as you can see
its gets collapsed,
the car haven't been hitted, but still its gets collapsed
so, what we will do we will go to forward, i think car need to be,
and here you find all the plug-in which are deactivated or which are activated in maya
no problem, so select this file, go to nucleus and here you have the gravity if
then only it will collide the same so, as you can see if the car touch the surface
then that particular area will collide, otherwise it will not collide so, like this way you can
work, in sixty two frame it will be off and as you can see it’s getting collide quite well
and after that it will come to the surface
so, now you have the idea and if i press forward, if this will
hit the surface, then only it will collide and you have couples of different thing,
will discuss one by one so, it will now collide the same and
like this way you can work quite well, as you can see here all the cracks is been formed and
so, what i will do here we have the obj export dot bundle, so i will check the same and will
so, now we will move further, will pause this for a while, and we will move further
auto load it and in future, we will work in bifrost in this particular session only
﻿hello everyone so in this session, we will make a silencer of a bike and will emit smoke from it
and select this one also
move it here and now, will just go to vertex, select this part, just synchronize the size
that would be our silencer and if i press three, it is going like this so,
what i will do, in mesh tool you found the insert edge loop tool, so will insert some of the edges
to avoid the smoothness and if you press three, that would be fine so,
you can also use your own model i will adjust, eject the smoke from here so, now what i will do,
will go to press one and put it somehow here now, in top, you have to go to the dynamics tab
we are not using nucleus dynamics, we are using dynamics when you are going to dynamics tab, so
in dynamics tab you have fluid effects so i will just go to fluid effects and here you have the
so let’s continue i will go to the front and will just drag a cylinder and we’ll just drag it
create three d container with emitter so, i need the emitter so, i will just click over here
and now, as you can see, a new box has formed with the emitter so, i will just delete this once
again and just go to the fluid effect and create three d emitter now, i will just rotate this,
as you can see, we are rotating in x direction so, i will just minus ninety and just enter it
now, i will just move it here and just move it here so, you can see, am just moving
here and just move it here now i will just select the emitter and this particular part
and will just put it somehow here so, i will just put somehow here and
so, i will select this and just move forward no problem, we will keep it here and will just
move it laterwards so, now what i will do, as you can see, we will just off the grid and just make this
to three hundred so, we will increase or decrease it according to our need now, i will just select
so, as you can see, this is a cylinder so we’ll just form a simple silencer and you can also use our
the container, only the container i will select the container i will go to the attribute editor
and in attribute editor, if i just drag this, i will have a little bit of space so, by selecting
the container, in the attribute editor, you have fluid shape two is because, we have just
deleted the first one and just make the another one, that is why it is returning the two
so, now we have the container properties in container properties, which we have base
resolution which is ten, so i will increase this with forty so, it will add some more details
in your smoke so now, what else we have to do we will just reposition it later and after that
we have the auto resize so i will check the auto resize it will automatically resize the smoke
and after that we have auto resize threshold, so which is zero point ten, so we need so much
more a decreased value, so i will just put zero zero zero two okay
model so, how we can achieve it, let us see i will go to the channel box and here we have the
now, we have the density and in density, density is basically inside the content
details if you go to the content details, you found the density so, panels have the sub panels and as you can see
content details have all the things here so, as you can see, density, velocity, turbulence,
temperature, fluid, colour, all the things are situated in the content details
now, in content details, we have density, in density we will just increase the buoyancy
as you can see, if i just increase this, the smoke is forming at the front okay,
so, as you can see, the smoke is going at the front, so i will just increase the buoyancy by
little bit okay, fine and dissipation, will just increase this little bit,
not so high this would be fine and diffusion, so it will add some random movement into it and
add some random jiggleness also so, okay, i will just off this and in one more thing we have to do
input so, go to poly-cylinder one, we’ll decrease the axis by eight and we need cap which is two,
so, if you need the bounding box, you can just go to the bounding draw and you can just
off it and on it as you required so, if you just go to none, it will just hide but i need it,
so i will just put it here okay so, now what else we have required
just off this all
if you found this sub panels, it will just highlight in this colour, darker colour and
click and here you found this particular sub panels, which is
all came inside so, will go to the density and in density we have the diffusion
so, as we have increased this, now as you can see, if i go to front and just go, so i need some much more
and after that, we have the, so i will just increase this more,
and height we need at least three so now, as you can see, we go to face, our soft
as you can see, it is affecting quite well so, now we have velocity this is basically for
speed and all so, we have swirl so, it will just add some random movement also and just put it like
this and just have a look as you can see, it is just forming some swirl effect if we increase the
volume, what happens let us have a check if i increase the value by ten, see what happens
as you can see, it is forming the smoke quite well
so, i will just decrease this by four and will move here and just have a look so, like this way,
you can increase the size of the smoke and also you have to just experiment
over the panel one by one, you can have the idea because if you do the practice,
you know the each and every process step by step and after that you can do it quite well okay
so now, we have the one more thing, swirl we have done it and after that,
selection is on, so press b to end this by holding shift you can select the faces and
will go to the one more thing, turbulence in turbulence, we have strength
so, will just increase this little bit and let us have a look
so, if you increase this what happens see it is just forming in this, if i decrease this,
it will go so i will increase this little bit
and after that, okay, so now, after having turbulence, you have strength
and speed also so, will increase the speed, what happens?
and now, i am going to shading and here you have the panel, like
all the things, so, if i just go forward now what i will get, i will get all the detail features
inside the shading tab so, at first, if you need to transparent, you can transparent
quite well glow intensity, if you need to glow, the intensity you can glow it
will delete it and one more thing we have to do right click, go to edge, double click and now,
now, we’ll go to the colour tab and you can select, click over here and just change the
colour click and just click, and just change the colour so, i will change it to dark, black,
especially the black and you can just click here to just enlarge this particular view, just click
you have the colour input, so i will just put x, y, let us see okay, it is working quite well
if you go to z, no, i will put just y and just click this colour, like this you can flip
just flip this colour now, also just flip this colour so, you have a darker tone,
which is forming, after that the reddish tone like this way you can work quite well
as you can see here and you have the input bias, you can increase the input bias so, as you can
see, it is working quite well and also, the temperature is glow, as if you need to just off
press r to scale it as you can see, scale it, control z, sorry so, we will just scale and
the colour and just put another colour, you can do it well you have the full freedom to do it
one more thing we have to do what else we needed is to select these faces
﻿so, we have just work in the colour and now will off this all and will go to the content details,
if you just go here, you can found the colour which is producing is very darker and also,
you can just play with your colour as you can go here, you just click somehow here, just click
over here, just play with your colours as you can see, your colour is forming quite well
black colour only, okay done and we are in linear, you can go to smooth and have the smooth result
so, like this way, one more thing i have to discuss that if you are running into the timeline,
then it produce some amount of jerkness make sure that you will not run in the timeline like this,
you will just play here and just have a look at your smoke and all
so, if you need the value of turbulence more, you can just put the value of turbulence more
and one more thing, if you need to animate this you can do it well you will go to the tab like
you have the turbulence tab and in turbulence tab, as you can see, we have worked for the same
just select the container and what else we have to do, will shift select the silencer and after that
just go to the first frame and just go to the particles you have to make colloidal
so click as you can see, it just formed the colloidal
and if i select this, definitely it will select the same so,
it’s working quite well make sure that you will not just play in the timeline
like this okay, otherwise it just form the jerkness and all so, we do not require
okay, so, three or four things are main and each and everything you can just experiment
you have to work with turbulence, lighting and colour,
specially the content details which is density, buoyancy, noise and all
so, if i increase the frequency, what happens see as you can see, it is working quite well also,
just click over here whatever you do, you just do in a fluid shape we have all the features,
panels and here you can do it one by one as needed so you can just put the values
and just check is it working or not, is it fine or not okay, let us meet to the next session
your work cell is increasing this is the work cell so, now as you can see, we have just
make the smoke and if i just click here and you just found the detail of the smoke
you can also work in your colour if you need to work in the colour so,
you have all the things like, you can work in the colour and you can have smooth details, so,
as i think you have understand quite well, so, with the help of this few settings, you can just
work in this particular ones as you can see, we have just transparent it very well so, if i
just decrease the transparent level, you can find this small amount of smoke which is forming here
﻿hi everyone so in this session, we will make a rocket and will animate the thing and will produce
and in emission speed attribute, here you have speed method so, i will speed method to replace
after that we have all the values here so, we needed the directional speed so i will increase
this directional speed, i think one is fine let us have a look we’ll increase this laterwards
direction x i needed one one is fine, okay one is already there and direction y, so after x,
i need the y co-ordinates to be minus so that the fume form in a zigzag motion, irregular shape
so i will just put minus one or ten, i think ten would be fine okay, and direction z will be zero
so, we do not require direction z so, in outliner, again i will just select the fluid which is the container
itself and will go to the attribute editor so in attribute editor, inside the fluid shape one,
as you can see, there are many panels, but i am working here in the fluid shape one okay
so in fluid shape one, we have the dynamic simulation here you found the dynamic
so, now we do not require to go down because we will not focusing in modeling and we are focusing
simulation so in dynamic simulation, as i play this one, in from the first frame, as you can see,
one more thing, is that we do not require the gravity too much so what i will do, i think,
so we have the content details here so, i will increase this as you can see,
when i just open this, it has some sort of sub-panels inside it, which is density,
velocity, turbulence, temperature we will work in density at first and in density we
have the buoyancy so will increase this buoyancy little bit, fine and here we have the noise so,
will increase this noise little bit, so will just increase this a very little bit i think
twenty eight is fine now, we’ll go to the downward and will have the velocity panel which is
inside this particular only which is content details so, in velocity panel,
mainly in dynamics so, will not go to down and just insert some edges here so that i may give a
what else we needed, we needed is swirl so, if i go to first frame in this,
click, so i need some swirl effect so, here we have this swirl so i will jut increase this
i think one point sixty will be fine we don’t require too much of swirl
again we have the noise inside the velocity so, we’ll increase this noise to,
i think, fine so, we have the turbulence, which is again inside the content details
so, in turbulence we have the strength so i will increase the strength amount
and increase this little bit, do not require too much so, first frame,
okay now, what else we needed, we needed the frequency, so will increase the frequency
by three twenty and speed definitely we have to work with the speed
so, we will just increase little bit of it
shape of the bottle and all so, go to vertex so, now i will change my view to the front
hope you understand the same let us meet to the next session
and i will just select this part and press r button and just increase the size
as you can see, we have increased the size and also this one will increase and just
okay, now as you can see, we have just make some sizes and also will just
do one more thing is select the vertex and just move upward and just select this one
and just move upward you press three, you will found a kind of jar like object okay,
press one, so, as you can see, we will not extrude this downward because we will focus on the
dynamics, so here we have this one and required is, you can say cone and after that will go to the
some fumes with the help of this fluid inside maya two thousand eighteen so, let us continue
channel box and select the cone, will go to the channel box and here you have the input panel
so, i will just decrease the input panel, i will just go to the input panel and
will go to the polycone one and here you have the sub-division axis, will
give it twelve okay fine, so, no problem needed and more thing we have to do what else we have to do,
right click, go to face, select this face and go to the edit mesh and here you have the extrude
so, i will extrude this in downward direction and when it gets extruded will go to object mode,
select this part, will move it here and do one more thing, just select the face and
will extrude this again little bit okay, and object mode, will select this and just move it here
and now, what else we have to do, insert edge loop tool and just put some edges, edges is fine
just select this part and move a bit downward and now, the main thing happens is that i will just select
as you can see, we are in modeling tab and in modeling tab, we will just click and draw a
the two faces, three, okay three would be fine and after that, will go to edit mesh, extrude the same
in the outward direction and after extrude, control z, will select
four of them, i think four would be fine now, it is selecting the whole loop, so will go to
extrude and after that will just move it outward okay, so, now,
i will select both of them, will do one more extrude in the downward direction, so
will make rocket like this this is a diwali rocket and just move it here and
will select this part, will move it here and just increase the size, will move it at the top
so, will select this and will extrude, you can extrude it, well you have the freedom
so, i will just extrude it like this so now, we select the vertex will move at the top
as you can see we have made the rocket and will just transparent it and just
cylinder and will just move it over here and one more thing, this cylinder would be the container
move it here so that we have proper spacing and also, we will just put this into
this jar move it here and after that what else we have to do,
just isolate it, sorry, just transparent it, just shift this little bit and just move it here
as you can see, we have just move it and will just transparented it and obviously we have to just
give the support like this what happens now? well, be in one twenty frame, so
will just rename this one twenty because we do not require two hundred frames now will start
animating so, before animating make sure that this button will checked because this is the auto key
so you do not have to put by pressing s on the timeline all the time because auto key is on so,
you do not have to put s button on the timeline so, at first you have to just put only one time s,
just lock its position, will go to the fifteen frames and just move it here, control z sorry,
where the, as you can say this the bottle where the rocket will fly
will move it here and just go to here so, as you can see, it is getting out here
so i will just move it somehow here after that will move it to twenty frame and just
in thirty five, it just move here and just rotated okay, so will just move it like this
and after that, will move it here,
quite detailed okay, i will go to eighty five and just move it here
so, put here select this by pressing shift and just move it here
you can after that in one twenty, it is just gone to here and just rotated its position
so, you have a complete set of animation it is a rough animation you can do it quite fair so
this is for only example so, i will do one more thing one more thing you have to do
so, right now, what i am doing, i will just go to the edge and at first, will go to the mesh tool
each and everything is fine and
we have to work in the dynamics now so, at first i will save my file
i will go to the effects tab and after going to effects tab, you have the fluids in fluids,
you have the three d container so, i will just click the container now, as you can see, the
control h, hide the same this is the rocket, so will select the shape and just rename this rocket
so this is the rocket and so i have this small small emitter, so i will just select this emitter,
will delete the same now, you have the container and also the ground so, will put the ground here
okay, now, what else we needed i think i have to just hide the ground also, control h
and here we have the insert edge loop tool so, just insert some edges like this and just go to
so, now will just put a simple sphere, click and just make a sphere this would be the emitter
f, will click the f, so, delete the face here, so i do not require the face
select the sphere and just move it somehow here
go to the transparent mode okay
so now, as you can see, we have just putted the sphere inside it i will just put more inside it,
so i will just put it somehow here and after that, what else we have to do,
just press five and now, as you can see, we will save the file, one more and, okay
so, i will select the container and in the attribute editor,
so you have fluid shape one so fluid shape one, in fluid shape one, you have the very much
features so i will go to auto resize and will just click in the auto resize so fumes which will
face and just select the top and just delete it now we have a hole here and one more thing we have
generate from it, it will automatically resize and after that, what else we have to do, select
the container and shift select the sphere i will go to the fluid tab here we have the
fluid tab and in fluid tab, here you have the add/edit contents okay, so, in add edit
contents you have the emit from object as you can see, here you have the emit from object
so, what happens if i just click here, as you can see, it is emitting from the object we’ll
pause this for a while, go to the first frame and now, i will select the fluid container only
and go to attribute editor in fluid shape one here you have the container properties
so, you have the base resolutions so, i will just increase this base resolution to around
fifty two, okay fine and now what else we needed will just go to the outliner in window you have
the outliner so, i will go to the outliner here and just drag this
to do is just go to edge select all the edges and this time i will go to the edit mesh okay,
so, in the outliner, you have sphere, which is this sphere and if you open this,
you will found the fluid emitter one so, i will select this one, which is inside this sphere
as we have link both of them and go to the fluid and just add the add edit contents,
so emit from object, so i will select this fluid emitter one and what else we have to do,
will go to the attribute editor and now this time fluid emitter one, fine
we have the base emitter attributes okay, so, we’ll got to the base editor attributes, here you have
the emitter type so, i will change this emitter type to omni now, what else we needed, will just
go here only, base emitter attribute and we have the rate percent so, i will just increase the
percent by one thousand so that we needed more smoke and have some random animation in it okay
now, here you have the emission speed attributes so i will just go to the emission speed attribute
so, i will just extrude the same and will just go to press r and just extrude it little bit
﻿so, now what else we needed? we have the textures okay, so, i will open the texture
sub panels which is here; and we’ll select this sphere and will move it to here by
middle mouse dragging, and just dropping in it, just click here and just drop it
now, you can increase the size of the voxels itself,
then go to the first frame and we’ll save the file go to the first frame, if i play
stop it, so you can increase the size of the voxel as per as your requirement,
and also you go to the first frame now, i will select the fluid container at first,
shift select the rocket okay, so, we will go to fluids and i need some amount of collision, so
i will just go in the fluids and we have the make collide we’ll click here, now it will collide
some amount of smoke in this, and also one more thing we have to do we’ll select the
container and shift select this and in the fluid itself we’ll use same thing, make collide
and we’ll check all of them, and okay so we’ll off the texture and we have the lighting as
and as you can see if i just move it like this, if you select this one, you have
all the features like shading and all you can just work with the help of the colour and all,
you have all the features like colour, you can change the colour from here just click here,
change the colour, as if you need it to change the colour okay so, you have this one and increase it
like this way; we need smooth, so it will smooth the same as you can change the colour from here,
click here, click here, just change the it’s colour if you need more oranges’ tone,
you can do it well, you have all the freedoms so, like this way and also we have input bias,
you can increase the input bias as per your need and the edge drop off will not increase this,
we will not require this here you have the opacity, just can work with the opacity if you need
more opacity, you can work, but like this you can don’t have to work here we have to work between
you can see i am mainly working in the fluid shape and that we will go to here, we’ll have some
them and instead of linear, we will go to smooth so, we can see a curve is getting smoother and
smoother, so opacity is density, you can change the opacity
but, i think density would be fine because it’s getting the shape of here, and also
you can just decrease the size now, as you have seen in the previous tutorial also, we
have worked with the transparency; or you can work quite well because you know all the parameters
right now and we have discussed same thing in the previous session but, few amount of modification
we required in this session so, like this way you can just make your own, own fluid dynamics with the
experiment of this all you can have to work in your bonfire or meteoroid or even smoke and all
so, now you have the idea how you can achieve those results with proper experimentation
adjustments and all so, in lighting we have self shadow, click here to have a self shadow okay, so,
after having self shadow, i will go to outliner again, will select this fluid emitter one and
after that and in fluid emitter we have fluid attributes, so which is currently off
so, on this thing and here you have the density method, so i will add this, okay we’ll not change
this one you have the voxel and section, so we have this part and will increase this by ten;
and put this sphere inside this okay, now, our rocket is moving, but not the sphere
so we have to link it quite so, will select the sphere and in the outliner tab, here you have the
﻿hi everyone, so as we have done the playblast and i will show you the result so, as you can go here
and render it in seven twenty or even if you want to go to higher, you can go to ten eighty p
so, now you have the idea how you can just make the fluids inside maya software,
so we will learn about the end cloth inside maya application so, let’s meet to the next session
and just hit on the playblast, so you can have the playblast so, what the result is that this is the
result, so as i scroll here, as you can see it's forming quite well and see the result is quite
good you can have the colour correction and all in the compositing software so, like this way
it will work, so playblast is very important so, i have just playblast it and these fumes
are going here and there, and the irregular shapes that is forming quite good result
and also you can work in the colour, so you can also make a scene and work in the colour
and put some you can say put some background image and put some lighting you can also work in mental ray
or even in arnold, so like this way you can check with the help of the playblast and
after that if you are satisfied just go to the batch render, and use the batch render
﻿hi everyone, in this session we will make soft body dynamics inside maya application,
r button for scale and will scale this up, so that it will also blow so, now i will select this part
will move up a little bit, and will go to ndynamics, and here you have
the nmesh, which is create ncloth click over here now, as you can see a new
nucleus has formed, this is the nucleus of this ncloth as if i play what you will see,
it’s just going down and nothing happening see, it’s just going down and nothing happening,
so, at first i will increase my timeline to two hundred then what i will do, i will select this
and will go to attribute editor, and here you have the ncloth shape
in ncloth shape, you will find very much detailed panels, so at first, we will focus on pressure
so, here is the pressure, so i will just decrease its pressure, i think four thirty three is fine
so let’s gets started now, what i will go? i will go to polygon and i will go to
minus zero point four thirty three and after that what i will do, i will play one again,
so as you can see, its get synchronize and just falling into the downwards so, i need to fall into the
grid, so what i will do, i will go to nucleus, and here you have the ground plane,
which is just below to gravity and wind so, we will not using gravity and wind from here,
we will somehow use from our upward panel so, will go to ground plane and use plane
when you click over the use plane, then you have the plane frequency also so, i will just increase
it little bit, i think three seventy eight is fine, and if i click over here you will found
smoother view, so i need my balloon to be start from this position if i go here and just play,
as i need that my balloon will start from this position and will blow after that will
polygon tab and here you have a sphere now, i will just drag a sphere and will drag this upward
float in the air, so, what i will do, i will go to n solver, and here you have the initial state
so, i will do set from current, so in nsolver you found this particular one,
and here you have the set from current if i click as you see we are in sixty seven frame
as when i click here now, it will start from the first, this is my initial state,
what i will do, i will select this part and make sure that you will not change the pivot, let it be,
and i will go to attribute editor and here you have the ncloth shape
and after that what i will do, i will go to pressure tab, so, here we have the pressure
make sure that you are in first frame and after that just click over here, set key okay now i will just
will move forward and after that, i will need to start blow my balloon, so i will put
a little bit and, go to input, and here you have the subdivision axis, height so, if you just put
and will go to, but it’s not going upward, so what we have to do? it’s just coming back
and after that here is the magnitude, so will increase magnitude upto twenty five,
enter as let’s check so, its going i think top,
we have to increase the magnitude, so i will put around forty five, let’s check at first
ok fine, so, what i will do? i will select this part, set key will put zero,
and set key again, will move little bit,
fifty five and fifty five that would be okay as we have increase its segments, you can increase it
will increase five, will move forward, will increase five, i think we need
sixty five and will set key now, it’s gone 00:08:39 --> 00:09:12 as you see, its blow and its gone okay, now what i will do? i will just off this and will go to first frame
and now will press five button, and will go to surface sorry polygon and here i have the plane,
so i will make a plane and let’s make a plane because i have to add the thread also,
so this would be the plane and select this and go to channel box and here you have the input panel
i will not increase the width, i will increase the height, and
upward a little bit, will put somehow over here and will go to nmesh
as much as you can, but make sure that your pc will not been hanged
create ncloth and make sure that your ground plane is being checked, use ground plane okay fine,
we don’t have to increase or decrease the plane bounciness or frequency, friction sorry
what i will do just pause over here so, i will select this and will make initial state, set from
right click, go to vertex, select this part and here you have
the n constraint and here you have the transform, click over here now, it sticks to the ground
and what i will do next i will select this part, right click, hold your right click, go
to vertex will select this area and will shift select this area, right click,
go to vertex, and i will stick the vertex somehow from here, by holding shift button
because directly affect your cpu, if you increase its axis and height segments, so after that will
and what i will do i will go to constraint and component to component so, now you find
the two lines which is formed here, so at first i will just select its vertex
and will shift select and will right click, go to vertex and will shift select both of them,
and will go to n constraint and move to component to component now, what happen see
and there are lots many panel, so we have to focus
on a particular panel and so here i will just open my
constraint and the dynamic constraint to which is been stick to the balloon
so, this dynamic constraint we don’t require, but this constraint we required so, if i go
here what i am finding let’s see, i will just put four for examine only and will put the grid off,
go to the deformation and here you have a particular thing, which is sculpt deformer if
let’s have a look,
as you can see it’s not stick to its surface so, we need to stick to its surface and
here you have the constraint method, we have the weld dynamic constraint attributes
so, let’s see press four,
you can see its stick to its surface, just move with it,
press five, as you can see here its stick to its surface now, let’s have a look,
if you need more pressure into the ncloth system, you can put, i will just pause over here now,
you have the idea that how you can create the balloons, and how you can put pressure and all
so, instead of having this, you can also play with any other or even with your model also
i click before i clicking i will just press four, so that you can see it a wireframe and if you
and you can also use textures, if you want to use texture, you just go right click, 00:14:50 --> 00:15:12 assign new material and just use the blinn because that’s a balloon because of shines as you can see here so, what i will do? i will just go to its, okay one more i just have to apply,
assign new material blinn and now it’s applied to its surface, now i will change the colour
to light blue so, much more like this and will do the transparent also
now, you can see and you can also use the background, or just render this thing to
have a good background into compositing software like this way you can also
work, so hope you have enjoyed it let’s meet to the next session
click here, you will found a new thing will form inside it now, what i will do i will just put
﻿hello everyone, so in this session we will understand the features of soft body dynamics
ok,here you have the outliner which we have opened shape is all you see because you need to make
i will go to display mesh again
so, now as you can see there is a note, so here you can read, a water filled balloon is
simulated here by using the volume pressure so, we don’t have to go to this message and all; so,
ok,i will close the same because it’s opening the option; so ok,
now will go to hypergraph hierarchy and what else we have, we have blob, nucleus and ncloth one so,
this would be the output cloth, and this would be the nucleus, this would be the blob
so, if i select the blob,as you can see it’s showing over here;
let’s continue so, at first what i will do will go to polygon and here i have the polygon,
if i select the nucleus, it will show over here if i select the ncloth, it will show over here;
so, this is very important hypergraph hierarchy is basically for doing connection internally;
so we will discuss this laterwards and it has all the sub tools which is
embedded in it as you can see here so, it’s basically the internal collection or the internal
link between the objects and the effects and all;
so, this is very important as you can go over here also, or you can over
connect all the things in hypergraph hierarchy also this is you can say little bit of typical
but it will show after when you open it; it will show block by block that would be easy to find
whatever you click over here it will directly give the information; and in attribute
editor the property feature will be came so, as you can see we have output cloth one and
so, at first will go to box; i will just maximize this particular section of
make sure that whenever you animate, you have to look at your timeline now, we have one twenty, so
i did i did need at least two hundred; two hundred will be fine and now for animation
there is a hot key, which is s; as you can see here there are the translate x, y and z all are
not activated but, whenever you press s button; all the things will be highlighted with
you can sey pinkish colour so, here also your timeline gets animated and i will go forward by
at twenty, twenty five frame and will press s again
s the same, nowyou can see its coming; that means we will just give the translate value
perspective and i will just drag a box and after dragging what we will do
to fourteen and we will put s button, so it’s gets animated; so now play,
i think it’s fine i will increase by two fifty again, will select this;
after two hundred into twenty it will go round here, eight would be fine
so, now we have a like a bounce in and bounce back and will stop at that point so,
as we have animated and we will also change the rotation also; so we need to edit the rotation
so, i need to change the rotation from here; so i will put the value of rotation around
and press s; will go up to here, plus three hundred press s will go up to here
we will put over here, somehow over here and so after dragging we will go mesh
so i play forward
let’s see ok now, what else we have will go to nmesh and
again, but this time will choose the display current mesh; and will play now
ok fine will pause this, now make sure that you are saving your file; so saving is very important
so, i will just make a new folder will name maya dynamics
should have to save in ascii you can also save in binary, but sometimes binary gets corrupted;
but ascii will not corrupt if there is a mistake;
and here you have the smooth so, we will smooth it
then obviously it will corrupt the same so, ascii will be fine and i will rename this
fluid underscore zero zero one, fine
a dynamic properties as we discussed earlier but, this time will go to dynamic property map;
so it will down of the dynamic property just below of it and you can find over here,
so, we will just go to wrinkle map type; wrinkles means it has wrinkles
that means it has structure like irregular shapes and all;
so wrinkle map here you have the wrinkle map and here you have the texturing panel this is the
texturing window, so we will just click over here; and now we have to put some noise so, for noise i
and after that what you have? this shape; so
will go here, you have the noise texture; when you press the noise, now the noise panel will came
so, in noise you have time which is very important; so it’s need to be animated so, for
i will start from here, so will select the time; right click, set key or you also click by s
but, it will animate all the things; so i don’t need to animate all the things because laterwards
if i came to any of the panel; that would be hectic for me to just remove the same so,
will go up to here and just put five on the keyboard at thirty frames,
fifty would be fine; five and set key now, it will change;
are simulating something and if what is simulation means?
now what i will do i will just double click it and now we have the tool setting of this
that means if you are working in effects and all; if you producing anything inside maya
its need to store its data for further use; that means one time it will cache the same after that
the data will be saved to your computer and you don’t have to play one by one again you don’t
have to just put your time in that particular simulation; you have the cache data you have the,
you can say the rendered baked data, you can run across the timeline; and just see if this is
possible now, this is getting not updated at the back; but it’s getting updated at the front
that is not happening in the cache; so i will select the blob data
here the blob thing has been selected, and will go to there you have the n cache
and in n cache you have create new cache; so will go to its panel, and here you have all the things
so, i have the cache directory user, that’s my macbook name, documents, maya, project, default,
particular move tool you know better that if you press w, then move tool will came;
cache, cache fluid zero zero one; so, that is fine you can just put your name blob animation;
so i putted blob animation, and i think everything is fine you don’t have to just
one file per frame is fine, not one file; because it will generate only one image at a time
so, i need one image per frame that means we have two fifty frames; so we need one image per frame
and time slider is fine, we don’t need render settings; because we will do it laterwards
so, it will just generate after one frame, every one frames and before it and after it so,
running quite smooth so, that’s the main feature of cache and you have to rename it properly
if you press e, then rotation will came; if you press r, then scale will came if you want to
more into its detail and its attribute editor and will add some much more modification in this
so, let’s meet to the next session, and make sure that before going i will just save my scene data;
created something wrong in that particular version; you can go to the previous version
or, if your file gets corrupted at that particular version; you can go to the previous version
and you can work for the same; otherwise you have to make from beginning so, that would be hectic,
so make sure that you are making your version so, let's meet to the next session
go to its property feature, just double click it; and here you found the tool settings
and we will also look at byforst inside maya two thousand fifteen; so let’s continue now, at first
so, we will go to move tool and we have this tool setting features; so here what we have?
we will just go to vertex and select the vertex here, and
so we’ll go to x axis; let’s see
so you have the symmetry feature here as you can drag, now because here you have the x axis and
here is the x axis so, if i select this, it will just produce in the x; because we are in object
mode and here is the x, if you go to y; then it will produce somehow over here if you go to z,
then it will produce somehow over here; so, will go to x and after that we will off this thing
now, we will whatever we will do here; it will automatic adjust it in the
what i will do? i will just go to polygon and here we have the polygon features
opposite direction so, i will make this particular thing more thick and
kind of structure; and go to object mode and i will rename this, so for rename
what i will do i will go to window and here i have the outliner so, i will adjust this outliner
viscosity; it has viscosity and it will have a jelly like structure so, i will rename it blob,
ok,now will minimize it; so we have outliner and what i will do next
i will go to mesh again and will just go to smooth; now this time i will not select
this smooth here i will go to its window panel; here is the setting of smooth and here you have
the division level so, i will increase the division by two, i think two is fine
apply, it’s apply over here and will cross the same and go to object mode
so, if you select any of them, if you change any of the panels as we discussed earlier after assets
so, let’s make some much of more irregular shape; if you select any of the part if you press b,
then soft selection will came; as you can see i am holding b button and by left mouse button,
you can drag the size of your brush; so that means if you want to off this of selection
just pres b again; and if you want to on, just select any part, press b now, if you hold your b
and left mouse button, you can increase the size of your brush so, i can change little bit of it,
it is a irregular type shape; and what else we have now or, we will go to modify and
here you have the freeze transformation what freeze transformation does? it will just put
all the value to zero zero zero and only scale will have one so, that means it will freeze to
its position and freeze transformation all the values has gone zero, and only one is there
all the things will be changed from the top; that means each and every panel have their own
now, what i will do i will go to edit and here you have one more thing to do delete by type, history
so, it’s very important to delete and clean its history; so now i will select this file i will
on my outliner and here i have the blob these all are for the four views of maya as you can
see here; these are all four views of maya so, here is the default light which is attracting
over the surface and the viewport there is the default object set, so this is called
the object set tool; so we don’t have to look at it so, we will focus mainly in the work
so, what i will do now? i will just change my panel; will move this little bit little here
so, select it, i will change its panel to ndynamics; so we have two things this is dynamics
and if all the things will come with the nucleus; all the things which come in nucleus it has kept
over here, which is ndynamics; that means nucleus dynamics, so i will just click over ndynamics
property features and whatever you drag here, it will all come over here; in attribute editor
whenever you click over ndynamics, you have all the features change at the top so,
in nmesh you have create ncloth; so i will just create in ncloth, click
and now as you can see in the outliner, if i drag this; a nucleus and ncloth one has formed
this is the you can say the object feature of the ncloth; this is also called the property feature,
and this is the nucleus as in bone, we have pelvis region, and in dynamics we have nucleus; so
this is the center of modification, center of axis and all so, i will minimize it for now and as you
can see if i play; it is going down because we don’t have just edited it, so we will use it;
and make sure that your ncloth has been selected so, it is by default selected and this is the
nucleus what we do now, we will go to attribute editor; and i will just put somehow over here,
here is fine so,
and in channel box to manage its feature dynamics has very much values and also you have to
i will go to attribute editor and in attribute editor, you have two features;
which is ncloth shape and nucleus so, this is the ncloth shape and this is the nucleus all the
property features related to its shape will come over here; and all the property features related
to its behavior will come in the nucleus so, what else we have? so at first will go to ncloth shape;
here you have the preset inside ncloth shape one so, if i click the preset,
i needed jelly like structure; so in preset you have many things
so, i will just go to waterballoon and here you have the replace; so i will do the replace
now, it is been applied over here and what else we have?
and if i go here; we have the dynamic property so, there is a lot of more things, so
the main things we will focus here; because there is a lot of more thing you can
go to through it very thoroughly and you have to also practice quite well then you
keep on experimenting the things and you will or get all the things, and so i will
go to dynamics property now and in dynamics property, here you have the input mesh attract;
so we will not select this right now; we will discuss laterwards what this will
do? this will allow it and form some amount of giggleness into it; that means random movement
or you can also say exact motion of it and it will attract the mere by particles,
which gets collide into it so, we will use this laterwards and now what i will do i will
go to nucleus one; and in nucleus one there is more features whenever i am playing it,
it’s going down; so we don’t need to go to the down so,what i will do now
here if i go down, you gave the ground plane
and here is the use plane; so, we have to check it ok now, there is lots more features,
can understand it, so that means whatever you see in this tutorial, you have to practice it;
you have the scale attributes; i will open this and what else we have
time scale and space scale; so, these both are for animation purpose so, we will also
discuss this laterwards after few times so, now i will go to ncloth shape one,
as i have discussed that we will just focus on this now,
input mesh attract, so i will put little bit of it; that means zero point one that would be fine
and now we will run the simulation, let’s see what happens as you can see it’s behaving quite well
as compared to the previous one; see, so i will just go to the first frame if you click here you
can go to the first frame; as there is a message window, also go to the start of playback range
here you have click on the same, click and after that what else we have
because we will undergo through many values and modifications, so
﻿hi everyone let’s continue to this session now what i will do i will go to attribute editor
and get ejected out
so i will pause this now if you press three it will add smoothness and after that
just select any of the part, right click, go to assign new material and here you can put any
other material, so i will put blinn and in blinn you may have the color
and you can implement the color like this or if you want to add the texture you can go over here
you just have all the things so if you want to add noise you can add noise and press six
so you have the noise now if you want to change the color you can change
of lustre in it and here you have the color panel, click over here and here you have the fractal
because layer management is very important just i have to put over here i will rename this
some amount of stickiness in it because we have just make the ground which is passive collider
and these all are cloth which is basically n cloth we just putted over n mesh
so you can take the seamless texture because as you can see here is the seams which is get
produced when its moving around so you can simply put some sort of texture or even you can also
ok, now we’ll have selected the particular object as you can see over here we have just selected
the object from the outliner and right click we’ll add selected object now you can hide easily ok,
it’s going so much of down, so i just select the box only we’ll drag
this little bit will put it somehow over here so we’ll go to another view and
we’ll check by, four pressing you can check as you can see if i just play it what happens?
so i just press five now i have to put it over here somehow over here ok fine, so, now
what i will do,
and now at first we’ll go to outliner, we’ll just put the outliner over here somehow over here
i will just select this and we’ll go to modify,
freeze transformation because i have the values by and i have to just put it zero
zero so freeze transformation and now i will just select this box and we’ll go to
edit delete by type so we don’t need any type of history and now the history is cleaned so
we have a box and the blob now we’ll go to window and in window
here you have the hyper graph hierarchy so here you find
we have one more thing is that bifrost so will select the bifrost and here you
the liquid so we will select the liquid click, now
and now in attribute editor i will go to nucleus one in nucleus one there are more features but
it has formed over here but you cannot see so i will just put four as i play forward
and it will catch the same
now what we will do i will select the blob shape and we’ll go to attribute editor
and we’ll select the bifrost shape here we have the bifrost shape
now we’ll go to bifrost liquid container one,
so we will discuss this later wards because we have to just go through the collision and all
so at first i will go to bifrost shape one and what i will do we have bifrost meshing
and i will go here and will enable it so now what we will do
if i press three what happens see, it will smooth it as its forming more precise thing
as you can see its bouncing so much and now we’ll just add assign new material and we will
at first what i will do i will just deselect it so i don’t need the nucleus property
add the ocean shader let’s see what happens ok, now here you have the ocean attributes and
you have all the things lied at over here that means you just have to apply one by one
and we’ll press four
now what we will do, we’ll select the bifrost liquid and we’ll just select the
so what i will do now instead of using ocean now i will just assign new material and just
put the blinn only because it is getting heavy so much so now you can see it’s looking fine
so for checking purpose i just put the ocean and but when we use to compose that sort we
features over here so if you deselect the unable, the nucleus property features will be
will just put the ocean shaders later wards we’ll press four and we have all the things
so we have bifrost mesh and we have bifrost panel, we have bifrost liquid
so all the things are coming over here so what else we have
right now in bifrost we have the collider so we will just apply the collider now you can
see the collider has applied and there is a small dot like structure is forming over here
so as you can see now it’s showing again all the things property features and you have pressure
if you increase the pressure damping little bit of it and just go to the previous frame
and if you can see that somehow it will change it shape and all
off and your simulation will play smoothly as compared to the previous one
so you can collide so now you have the idea how you can create the viscous
liquid and you can go to start pressure and you can also work with pump rate and all
so we have just made the simple liquid so you can collide with any other object
so we had to just click over the create passive collider and it will collide the same and also
you have to do some modification with attribute editor and all because it’s very important
now you have the idea about the nucleus and the n cloth first i will just make a new version so
go to file and we’ll make a new version save scene as i will just make a new particular version
so, if i select this part and at first i will go to first frame as you can see we have applied
bifrost and all in this and if the collide will happen then we will apply some textures
so, now what i will do i will just select this part and will do the control d
if you on this thing that means nucleus will embed its property features to your model
if i do the control d if i go previous frame what i will get?
i will get nothing because the animation will not been copied so i will delete this and we’ll
put the fresh part so control d again now as you can see we are in first frame so we have
taken this shape of it and it will automatic update the shape as if you are in middle frame
whatever shape will came, it will automatic copied in the duplicate version
so i will just put that first shape and after that what i will do i will just select this
part and this would be second cloth and we will put the second cloth modifier so what we will do,
we will go to mesh and here we have the create n cloth as we have discussed earlier
and after clicking over the n cloth, we will form nucleus and in attribute editor we have n cloth
shape two in shape two we have the preset and as you can see there are collision and
or your geometry and it may take few times so i will just deselect it that means i will
all the things embedded over here so at first you should go to preset
and we’ll change it to water balloon and we’ll replace it same if need so much more
of its result you can go to blend ninety or even seventy-five percent or fifty percent so i will
replace by hundred percent, so i will replace it and when it replaced it shows the note;
the water filled balloon to be simulated here by using the volume so that means it has been
applied to that particular body now
going to dynamic property which is just below it here you have the dynamic property and
in dynamic property there is input mesh so as you can see here there is the input mesh
attract and this is zero point zero zero we will make this zero point two as you
can increase this little bit and enter it and after that we will just select the ground and
as we have did it before but we will just do it right now create passive collider
now we will select the blob shape and go to its attribute editor and here we have the n
cloth shape to which is by default open so in the dynamic property map, we’ll go to dynamic
you can have the noise which is by default texture present in maya i will just click this noise
and after that we’ll go to time
here you found the time and we’ll animate it one by one
so make sure that you are in first frame right click set key and we’ll go further
as you can see its getting collide with that particular one
i will just put this in a particular layer
﻿hi everyone in this session we will make soft body dynamics inside maya application
r button for scale and we’ll scale this so that it will also blow so, now i will select this part
i will just select this part move up a little bit and we’ll go to n dynamics and here you have
the n mesh which is create n cloth click over here now, as you can see a new nucleus has form
this is the nucleus of this n cloth as if i play what you will see
it just going down and nothing happening see it’s just going down and nothing happening
so, at first i will just increase my timeline to two hundred then what i will do
i will select this and we’ll go to attribute editor and here you have the n cloth shape
in n cloth shape you will find very much detail panels so at first we will focus on pressure
so here is the pressure so i will just decrease its pressure
so, let’s get started now what i will go, i will go to polygon and i will go to
i think four thirty-three is fine minus zero point four thirty-three and after that what
i will do i will just play one again so, as you can see its get synchronize
and just falling into the downwards so i need to fall into the grid so, what i will do,
i will go to nucleus and here you have the ground plane which is just below to gravity and wind so
we will not using gravity and wind from here we will somehow use from upward panel
so, we’ll go to ground plane and use plane when you click over the use plane,
then you have the plane frequency also, so i will just increase it little bit i think
three seventy-eight is fine and if i click over here, we will found that its just
fall to the ground so, as you know that i am making a balloon i will press five for
smoothen view so, i need my balloon to be start from this position if i go here and just play
polygon tab and here you have a sphere now, i will just drag a sphere and we’ll drag this
as i need that my balloon will start from this position and will blow
initial state so i will do set from current so, in n solver you just found this particular
one and here you have the set from current if i click as you see we are in sixty-seven frame
as when i click here now it will start from the first this is my initial state what i will do
i will select this part and make sure that you will not change the pivot let it be
and i will go to attribute editor here you have the n cloth shape and after that what i will do
i will go to pressure tab so here we have the pressure, make sure that you are in
stop right click again set key
upward a little bit and go to input and here you have the subdivision axis height
we’ll move forward and after that i will need to start blow my balloon so, i will put
and will go to but it’s not going upwards so what we have to do its just coming back so now
what we will do, we will just select this and we’ll go to field and here you have the air
it’s magnitude, go to outliner and here you have the outliner and we will just select the air field
and after that here is the magnitude so, we’ll increase magnitude up to two twenty-five
so, if you just put fifty-five and fifty-five that would be okay as we have increase its segments
so i will click one by one,
we’ll increase by, we’ll move forward, we’ll
and now we’ll press five button and we’ll go to by polygon and here i have the plane
so, i will make a plane and let’s make a plane because i have to add the thread also
so this would be the plane and select this and go to channel box here you have input panel
i will not increase the width i will increase the height and sixty-five so,
now go to object mode we’ll select this strip and we’ll move upward a little bit
you can increase it as much as you can but make sure that your pc will not been hanged because
we’ll put somehow over here and we’ll go to create n cloth and make sure that
your ground plane is been checked used ground plane we don’t have to
increase or decrease the plane bounciness or frequency friction so we’ll move forward
now, it will just collide with that particular balloon and will fall and after that what i will
right click go to vertex select this part and here you have n constraint and here you
have the transform, click over here now its stick to the ground and what i will do next
i will select this part right click hold you right click go to vertex we’ll select this area
and we’ll shift select this area right click go to vertex and i will stick the vertex
directly affect your cpu if you increase its axis and height segment so, after that we’ll go to
somehow from here by holding shift button and what i will do i will go to constraint and
component to component so now you find the two lines which is formed here so at first i will just
select its vertex and we’ll shift select and we’ll right click go to vertex and we’ll shift select
both of them and we’ll go to n constraint and move to component to component now, what happens see
and there are lots many panel
so we have to focus on a particular panel and so here i will just open my outliner
so you have the nucleus, the cloth which is applied and the air field, dynamic constraint
don’t required but this constraint we required so, if i go here what i am finding let’s see
deformation and here, you have a particular thing which is skull deformer if i click,
as you can see it’s not stick to its surface so we need to stick to its surface
and here you have the constraint method we have the world dynamic constraint attributes
press five as you can see here its sticks to its surface now, let’s have a look
if you need more pressure into the n cloth system you can just put, i will just pause over here
now, you have the idea that how you can create the balloons and how you can just put pressure
and all, so instead of having this you can also play with any other or even with a model also
and you can also use textures if you want to use texture you just right click assign new material
blinn and now its applied to its surface now i will change the color to light blue
before i clicking i will just press four so that you can see it a wireframe and if you click here,
so, much more like this and we’ll do the transparent also
now you can see and you can also use the background just rendered this thing to have
a good background into compositing software like this so you can also
work so hope you have enjoyed it let’s meet to the next session
you will found a new thing will form inside it now, what i will do i will just put
﻿hello everyone so, in previous tutorial we have learned about the arnold physical sky,
arnold is very important, specially this one, which is area light and mesh light is not so
required and photometric is not also, but this one is physical sky is very important as it will
change whole of your scene and this light which is create light portal is also important as it is
like that of mental ray, physical sun and sky but in arnold, it have some other features
if i go to render setting and one more thing is that, if you go to system,
you find that render time is interactive this is because we have the particular section which is on
off you can also go from here or even you can also change it from here
bucket scanning, this is spiral what is bucket scanning? whenever you
rendered a particular section, there is a small buckets which will just rendered the particular
data that’s the bucket scanning so, just put like, ok, fine, sixty four is fine and
of the particular object and if you go to arnold and in lights, here you have the mesh light
one more thing is that, here you have the motion blur so, if you have some animations,
you can enable it and you have the environment, you have atmosphere and background what we have
discussed that in mental ray there is a physical sun and sky, you can also create from here
create ai atmosphere volume, create ai fog or background legacy ai physical sky creates
and also, one more thing is that whenever you are lighting a particular section, you have
all the freedoms, that means you can change one by one that means you can also modify the lights if
you are not satisfied, control z sorry, if you are not satisfy with a particular section of light,
you can just change it through attribute editor and there is a problem in selecting, you can go to
outliner and here you have all the features if you want to select this point and you
so, what mesh light does, if you click here and i press the seven, now you see, its converted into
can’t select it because there is a mesh also make sure that you have to rename each and everything
properly, otherwise you will be in problem laterwards if you have
very much thing inside your scene so, you can also change your letter from here
and one more thing is that, there are much more options if you select this light, specially this
one and go to attribute editor and here, inside this panel, we have so much more panels like
sub surface scattering, diffuse, specular, indirect or volume which is by default present
in your render settings also but these are different and these are different
this is basically inside the light and this is basically when your
scene will be rendered, after that it will apply the same so, if you can keep
increasing its value, then also it takes some render time so, now what we will do,
a light now, as with the help of this, you can also go to your additional parameters
so, quickly i will add some couples of more light and after that will add some animations so,
let’s make it now, i want to reposition all the lights so, i will delete all the lights one by one
and i just have only one light in this particular section of light
so, let’s quickly set up a particular scene so, i have just erased all the lights and we
have only one light here and one more thing is that, if you
one and one more thing is that, if you want to erase it’s mesh lights, then you just select
that particular section, press delete now, your mesh light will be deleted
and now, let’s quickly set up a scene for our lighting and what i will do,
now, you have all the things which suits and which you can change according to your needs
i will just go to the seven view and just put some of the lighting at first, will go to six,
control d and will put some lighting over here and have a look and what we will get after that,
let’s have a look will set the colour and intensity laterwards,
but will adjust the light at first, will go to render tab
and here we have the point light which is omni inside maya, we called it point light
inside maya, we called point light so, will put some of the point light because we need so
little bit of bounceness over here and we put some lights like this and after that
what we have, we have the back part so, will select this light only
and control d, will move here and just move here and what i will do,
just simply grab this, press r for scale and will scale this and will tilt this,
so, now its converted into mesh light and you can also change from here, the light visibility
so that its position is just straight of it so, just press seven and have a look
that if this is quite well or not i think its quite fine and ok we have to work in the omni
because you can select from here you can work in the omni because its bouncing so much, we need a
little bit of bounceness, not this amount of so, will just increase decrease the intensity by
little bit of lower and what happens if you have negative value in light?
if you have negative value, it will just absorb the nearby light's intensity so, will not put
any negative value if you can, you can have inside a particular big large screen in studio,
the artist use the negative intensity to absorb nearby light intensity so, ok now <?>23:00</?>
i think, ok fine and what we else have here,
we will just put it somehow over here and now, one more thing, the colour
for a test, i will just a render a particular image so, at first, i will just check all the
also, you can put some of the small lights here or you can use the spotlight or even
the directional but directional will change your whole scene so, will not use you have
the area light which is same as this one so, like this way also, we have more lights
and one more thing is that, i will just make a new omni and will press w for
move and what i will do, instead of going here, i will just put it somehow over here, the top and
control d again and we have just duplicated it make sure that you are just moving downward,
press f and if i increase the intensity of the light, there is more panel like decay rate which
is very important in decay, there is no decay so we don’t need no decay, we will go to linear
things are in low quality, ok fine now, i will just make a test render and what we will get,
and you can see it is changed quite bit so, here also, you can just select this and go to
linear and you can increase the intensity little bit linear will act like normal environment,
like natural environment and quadratic will decrease it’s intensity lower, cubic also
so, i just using the linear and here we have soft bounceness of the lights
so, if the render is not proper, then we have to also adjust it because
you can only do lighting in perfect way when you just click on render again and again, then only
so, we have just setted it scene make sure that whatever you are making adjustment, you just
save your file again and again because you have to work in the, you can say, versions so that is very
important so, i am just saving my file again so, now, what i will do, i will just go to
bookmark and camera view one and so, this is also test render, so,
will get nothing because that light has you can say vanished so, what we will do,
we don’t have to just require as you can see, here we have the bounceness of the omni and
here we have the darker part, so we need to work in this here also we have proper lighting
i think this one is fine this we have to work and we will use some amount of omni here also
and we will also shift this omni downward if the omni will shift downward,
then it will fall the whole surface here so, we don’t required any light here because
its already fine and what we will do, will just select the omni,
move little bit of down and what we will do, will increase the intensity little bit and control d
move it to somehow here, will move it to here, move it downward, move here,
so we are not using any linear or quadratic here because we need
lights and if i go downward, you have a arnold panel
here you have light visibility and also in downwards
inside omni, you have arnold panel if you open the arnold panel, you
find some of the main features of light you can use the exposure and sample value
this will just use your ram and graphic card so, later on we will just increase it and
we have visibility, light filter, so we don’t require light filters and cast shadow, yeah, we
definitely required cast shadow because we need some amount of shadows also
so, will duplicate this light, control d and what i will do, i will just put it somehow over here
because as you have seen, this part is getting darker and we don’t require darker thing like,
so will put somehow over here so, let’s have a look in this particular section view
bookmark, camera view so, its very important to setup your light if you are working in a
particular movie, if the movie is getting, if you are working in a particular shots,
and now, if we go here, we have the additional parameters which is by default present in maya,
but in this tutorial we will learn more about its and we will add some more lights from
if the shot is getting problem in few frames, that means in that particular
frame, you have to adjust the light so, we need more intensity over here so, what we
in sense of, using intensity, i just put one more here, which would be beneficial for me
and will increase it's intensity
you can say, and now we have to just have a good render and will adjust few of the properties
now, what else we have, select this, will go downward and all the things is fine
so, will go to render settings and will increase the camera aa by eight,
this is transform attributes so, we don’t require this
diffuse by, i think six, specular, exactly we need specularity, so i think six transmission
scattering instead of using transmission so, it will produce some amount of glow
in organic character modeling, especially in human modeling, we use sub surface scattering in skin
but we have mushroom in this section, so, we will use this sub surface scattering little bit,
so that it will just illuminate the light in it’s corner and in the top so, volume indirect,
volume indirect will increase by two ray depth, we don’t require ray depth
and here also we have specular but we don’t require ray depth because we have just
work in the sampling now, what we will do, will go to view and go to bookmark,
camera view so, i will just pause this video and will show you the render image
so, here, you have the show original mesh, no, we don’t required mesh
and you may have the better idea that how we can adjust by few tweaking the light and its
colour is fine use colour temperature, we don’t light visible and cast shadow, cast volume
so you can go over your intensity, just play around your intensity
i will just on the <?>3:59</?> so much if you want to change the colour of your light,
yeah, definitely you can do it well, you have all the freedoms, which lies over here, it will
directly turn off your adjustment and all so, here you have the use colour temperature,
you can have all the things and make sure that you just on the play button
arnold render engine and also we will look at some of the additional parameters inside
if i off this, as you can see, its getting bounced if i off this now, you can see, the light colour
which you have changed, its now updating over here so, if you just off this light visibility,
it will off the same, but still, the bounceness will be there due to this so, you can modify
bulb, tubelight inside a particular room so, like this way you can work quite well and
these are additional features inside arnold, so you can have all the things which have over there
will go to bookmark and here we have the camera view let’s have a test render
as you can see, a light is over there, if you need some sort of bounceness here,
you can do it well, but we don’t required bounceness
for bounceness you just add few of the more lights here by circulating its position
attribute editor so, let’s continue so, what we have? we have this scene
and you can have bounceness, but in lighting as you have seen, in previous, that we have
over here, and here is the sunlight which gets bounced because its just bouncing
from here and the shadow which is generating over here is from there
as you can see, over the leaves area also, that if you
see the leaves, the lower part is getting shadow as compared to upper part so, if you want to
render a particular section, you just click like this, if you want to render like this,
click, i will go to camera aa, will increase all the things transmission
little bit because it takes so much of time and we need sub surface scatter little bit
so, for a purpose i will just press four four is basically for wireframe so, its very easy to
so let’s have a test render
and now, you have the idea about how you can change the light and all so, here we have another
most important thing which is ies lights so, here have a couples of different presets of ies lights,
which is available in google by free so, you can go to any of the website which
provides ies light and you can download for max, maya or any other three d software
extension is ies file and its very small in size so, now, what i will do, for ies lights you have
this photometric light so, this will allow you to create some ies lights if you click over here,
now your photometric light has form, where it is, here i will press four for a time,
handle the wireframe if you are working in light, you have to check through the render tab, but if
go to here, press f to focus this particular section now, just put it over here, somehow over
just for the examine purpose, if you can work like this
you can work in perspective, if you are forming the light but make sure that whatever you work
in perspective, you just have to just rotate around your axis
to see the correct position if it is going in the correct direction, then its ok otherwise you have
to maintain it or even if you are not comfortable in perspective, you can go to any other section,
that is front, side and top or even, if you press shift button
and right click button, by holding shift and right click, you can change any of the view
in your maya so, that’s a very much freedom as you are not comfortable in perspective
so, i will just drag this because we need space we drag over here and what we else have, let’s see,
you are currently moving around your viewport or if you are examine anything particular section,
now, have a look
so,
now, what i will do, i have just putted the photometric light, which we have created from here
and in photometric light, we have a particular section inside attribute editor which is
photometric file so, here, we have the ies lights which is a kind of photometric light
and it is a open plugin so, what we will do, we will
just go to photometric file and here you have the folder just click over here and just go to
your desktop and here you have the ies lights connection and you have to go to any of them
i am just selecting any of the file because we have to just check
you can press four because, see, the scene is getting lighter but if i press seven,
so, here you have the load and after load, what happens, see, if you go to seven, as you can see,
now its generating quite smooth light, as you can see the light is getting bounced like this
have a look, here you have the bounce if you can increase the intensity,
it will directly bounce like this so, its also a bouncing kind of light
you can also drag the same like this if you focus on the top part like this or even you can also bounce
like this its a kind of spotlight but not exactly spotlight because if it has any surface to cast,
then it will cast in proper way otherwise if you move, it will just fall off and just work like a
target light, but its not a target light its a photometric and it will
only work when you have ies light profiles so, like this way, jut add some of the lights like
this, press control d for duplicate, just align the light if you if you found any of the darker
what happens, the scene will be heavier so, by pressing four,
region like here because you have to cast the shadow properly and you have the proper lighting
area also that means you just focus like this, press w, just move backward and have little bit of
bounceness of the lights so, its very important and to have a look at each and every lines
so, if you select, we don’t required white colour because already we have so much of white colour
lighter blue and all ok that is good, back of it is white, no problem just focus in this
so, like this way you can add your ies lights and you can <?>14:43</?> in render view
so, if you are not familiar with ies light, you can work with this rendering section and you have
all the lights over here you will find little bit of same into both of them, but yes, few lights in
you can go at that particular place ok now, one more thing is that if you select any
﻿hello everyone, so welcome in this lesson of render layers inside autodesk maya
and for that what i will do, i will just go to panels and perspective, will go to camera and at night
now what i will do once again i will go to perspective by holding my shift button, spacebar,
right mouse button, and go to perspective so, as you can see the camera is right over here,
we don’t have to displace the camera as we are set this particular camera here, and also we will just
render only one frame so, in previous session we have rendered the fifteen frames, because we
are working on the batch rendering and all so, we will just render in only one one frame,
and what i will do? i will just select each and every model and will group the same and
after that will just put all the lights in that particular layer, and will render the same
so, in png we will render all the data, and one by one we will just save the data into the folder, and will
compose into a compositing software so, whatever lights you have make
so, today we will look around the render layers inside maya software as we are in channel box,
inside the scene, you have to copy all the lights in each and every layer
so, one more thing i have to do, i will go to window and here you have the outliner
so, in outliner i will select all the lights and after that what i will do? control d
for duplicate, and will just make a new layer and will just hold this layer and will right click
add selected objects now, you can see your lights has formed, again i click
add selected objects like this way you can add the lights in a particular layer and so
add selected so, like this way i will add a couple of different
layers and as you can see i am just implementing the light in each and every layer, okay so,
add selected objects now, what i will do? i will just focus in this part only and
will make some much more layers i think we needed at least eleven, twelve layers
you have seen this particular layer which is inside display panel
so, i will make twelve layers will just add selected so, now as you can see we have the
master’s layer which has all the datas and we have all the layers, which has only lights so, what
else we have to do? we will just select the parts one by one and will just use the layers to just
add some selected objects so, right now what i will do?
i will just select the lights and will make a group, so control g and will rename this as light
so, we have the light group and we have all the layers, which are here and we have all the lights
so, right now what i will do? i will just select the lights and will control h to hide the same,
will select this, shift h to unhide the same so, like this way you can hide because
if i accidently select any of the, it will just go to that place and will just transform from here,
transfer to any of the layers so, at first what i will do? i will select this part,
so, we will focus on this render layers, so what is render layer? you will select each and every part
group here is the group, so what i will do? i will just select the group and will move to here
now, it’s been transferred to the outside from the interior and now it’s a group,
so, i will rename this wall, side wall so, layer management is very important and
if i select this side wall, i will go to layer one and add some selected layers as you can
see we have hided the lights that’s why it is not showing, shift h, it will show here
so, control h and it will hide the same, so at first make a new version so, save scene as
in a version so that would be fine, this would be side wall, side wall now, i will go to master’s
layer again will select this side wall, select like this and control h to hide the same
now, will select the ground will select this part and just move,
step by step and will off all the parts and will focus on that particular part, and will render
now, will select this layer, okay right click add selected and you have this ground
so, control g group on the interior and here it is, so the middle mouse button
and just move it here okay so, these are the small tables
and just make a new, go to a new layer add selected so, if your layer is up and down, if
you need these things to be up or these things to be down that doesn’t matter, you can put anywhere
in the layer, so because we will individually render all the images one by one so, you can put
sequence wise in your compositing software like photoshop, after effect, nuke and fusion so,
here if you just put some object in this layer, some object in this layer that doesn't matter
the same this will allow us to just select any of the part which is rendered in png
we will just arrange in the compositing software that would be fine so, this thing is what we have
small tables, i think add selected, so this is the side wall which we have hided
as you can see here we have side wall control h shift h you see the same,
we have masters layer so, we have ground shift h, light shift h, control h to hide the same
so, right click, shift spacebar, put your spacebar, right mouse button,
and go to the top view so, what i will do? i will just select these two,
and enter so, now what else we needed? control h to hide the same,
same will click this part, and will just group it control g to group the same,
and after that when you import all the footage into a compositing software, you can just directly
right click move it here will not move any of the layer, will move in between them, okay
lamp table underscore two two so, select this control c will go here, right click, add selected
right now, we will go to master’s layer control h again, and now will focus on the sofa,
will select this sofa from here and will control g to group the same,
middle mouse button, and move sofa and after that go to any of the layer right click, so go to this
one control h to hide the same, will select this wall which is the front wall control g
and will just drag this here which is the front wall,
select the front wall of it, this will be fine and will go to any of the layer right click,
now will go to master’s layer control h, to hide the same
this would be the single wall, okay so control g to group the same,
focus on that particular part and do whatever changes you want in the compositing software
now will just go to the master’s layer and will hide that control h
as we have this part, we don’t require this part because these are the junk part, so, we don’t
require this we have all the parts here so, as you have seen we have managed all the layers,
and will just delete this layer, because you don’t require these layers, so delete the layer
right now, i have hidden all the things as you can see,
so right now what i will do? now, i will just save this file,
and will work in the render settings and as you can see each and every panel has
a simple same render setting here, if you click you can go to its render setting so, will just
go to the next session and see about the mental ray features, and after that will
like colour correction, brightness, contrast, hue saturation and all the modification related
to colour or anything so, we will just render one by one, each and every part, step by step,
hello everyone, so in this session we will do the render layers, and also will just use
okay
so, right now what else we needed?
will just not needed the master layer, but will not delete it
because that’s the main layer, so what else we have to do?
will go to panel and we will go to camera
okay so, in perspective we had camera and as you can see we don’t require the animation,
and what else we needed
we just go to side wall and will render one by one and at first will go to render settings
make sure that it’s a mental ray that would be fine, so we don’t require final gather
and all
some of the parameters of mental ray
global illumination we don't require, will go to common tab
and if you are working in animation, that means if you have used the keyframes of animation
into camera or anything else in this scene, then you have to go to this
as we have discussed earlier file slash animation ext, so you have to go to this
and now you can activate your frames, that means how much frame you needed for that particular
one
okay or, you can also use batch render for the same, to transfer in another pc
so, i am not using any animation will go to the default settings, and what else we needed?
we will go to the here the preset
so, i just needed the seven twenty p which would be fine and don’t try to displace
so, as you can see in previous session we have just make each and every part and will
your camera, because if the camera will displace, all the things will be displaced from its
main position
and it will error to yeah just it will just produce the error method or error effect,
when you go to the compositing software and it will not match
okay, so please don’t try to displace your camera, don’t touch the camera, don’t change the
position of the camera
that would be better, otherwise each and everything will be gone
so, you have to just make and just put the camera again and just render the same, so
that would be hectic
so, please don’t touch the camera and just render one by one, because we have to place
have just group it, and just rename it and just put it into different layers as you can
the fixed position, the position where it has been placed right now
we have to place in the compositing software as same as this scene
so, okay now will go to side wall and here you have the same option which you have in the
render settings
so, if individually you want to just change the setting of the render of the side wall,
you can just go over here
or, otherwise if you change globally that means all of them so you can go over here
that is here it will update all the layers, but here it will only update this particular
part
so, i prefer to have global setting, but you can also do it well, i will not change the
see
values
so, as you can see all the things is fine, so image format is very important
i will just choose the png, so because i needed the transparency
because, okay so, i just needed the psd and after that what else we do?
we will just render the same, then also render from here will render from here
i will just wait for a while, let it be render
so, it’s not showing here
leave it because this here, but still let’s see is it showing or not here
so, one by one you can go any of them layers and you can found the lights also and also
so, if something is not showing at your screen, please don’t try to just focus your camera
over here
but, if you do it, whole the scene will be changed, your camera angle will change and
everything will not be matched
so, will just render a final image also for reference purpose or either we can also use
this final reference
the intensity is very high because each and every the layers has the intensity, so that’s
why the intensity is quite high
so, what else we have to do?
the objects
will just at least delete all the lights from each and every layer, and will just render the same data
and after that
will put the light, so the light is very very high here
so, what else we needed?
we just select all the layers and will delete the same and delete here
so, as you can see we have rendered all the things and also i have just rendered this
particular image, you can do it
well, i have just all the things as you can see here, we have the rendered layers, and
will put it all the references in this folder
so, like this way you can just have to copy the same light in each and every layer
and as you can see all the things is in png, and will just take this reference and will
go to the compositing software, and just do the compositing kind of thing
so, hope you understand this concept and we will proceed forward
and after that will go to master layer, select one by one object and just put it into the
each and every layer
﻿hi everybody, so in this session we will learn about the multi pass rendering inside
let’s start to work with the render layers so, at first what i will do? i will just make a
new folder and just make this render layers, so, and will put all the render layers one by one
at first, just go to the render settings see arnold is there okay fine, window outliner, and
here is the model and here is the light, which is sky dome light so, okay fine and
we have these lights also, so no problem,
so as you can see we have just selected the dome light which we have created
and also we have this mesh light, so we will have the multi pass rendering
from starting in the next session as you have seen that we have setup this scene,
and now in next session we will understand the concept of multi pass rendering
from starting hi everybody, so in previous session we have just setup some of the textures
and just go to this view, press spacebar, right mouse button, go to the perspective
and also this light so, in this session we will work in the multi pass rendering
so, for working in the multi pass rendering you should have this, which is launch render
setup window, which beside the hypershade so, click over here and now you have a panel,
so here you can see render setup property editor, these both are important so, right now will
go to the outliner, will on outliner here, and will on this over here so, now as you can see
we have to just first render this scene and so render camera is fine, and here we have the
arnold render okay fine so, will select the object which is the complete scene and by shift selecting
right click, create collection and in collection you got this, which is the property editor
so, now add all the things the bedroom and the sky dome light,
so, in the next tab we have the camera view and in this tab we have the perspective view
and after that what i will do? i will just render the same so, will render this scene and
let it be rendered one more thing you have to do, i will just escape it and just escape it
and will go to the arnold tab, and here you have two options this one and this one
so, as you can see if you click here, you can have the interactive render view, so i will just pause
this for a while and what i will do? i will just click here and after clicking here, you
got this panel, so you can increase or decrease the values for now i just put the default value,
so one is the default value so, okay at first when you are working in arnold,
you will go to the render settings and in render settings you have arnold render
so, as you can see camera aa which is three, so it will produce huge amount of small points if you
increase this, now your footage which will render in the render setup will be smooth and also
and now we will focus in this view, so what i will do? i will just make the interior different
will have bounciness of the lights, so i will just increase the diffuse and some amount of specular,
transmission and sub surface okay volume indication will be three, sub surface scattering will be
three, okay rest is fine and one more thing we have to do, i will render in hd five forty, okay
all just click here, you will on this and just work for the same, let it be render for a while
with different textures and shaders so, at first i will just select one by one
and just press f to focus that part only now, we have this bed sheet, right click,
assign new material and will use the arnold, so i am using arnold ai standard surface
so, after that will go to attribute, here you have the arnold ai standard surface, and
so you can see there is a lots of more junk which is forming here it’s all the history, so at first
what i will do? just select that particular object okay now, edit, delete by type, history,
so it will raise all the junk history, okay so, i will just select the bed sheet
maya two thousand eighteen, so let’s get started as you can see we have just selected this model
at first, press f to focus that particular part and after that will zoom out little bit,
and will see it, as you can see it here and now right click, assign new material and will first
open the attribute editor, and will use the ai standard surface so, we have ai standard surface
here and will change the colour to i think lighter blue and will use this particular material,
but will change the colour, and will change the colour to little bit of lighter blue
so, will select all of them by holding shift button okay and assign new material so,
i am just using this particular one, so as you know that you have different materials
you can also use that particular material, i am using only that particular one will select this
all of them by holding shift button and
so for that particular, i will press four, so, that we have a better view,
and we will do the multi pass rendering inside maya, so, at first i will turn off my grid
i am in wireframe mode so, i have selected all the cupboards, right click,
assign new material and ai standard surface will change the colour to lighter brown,
somehow like this, and after that will change the colour of the wall will select this part, press
five again, as you can see we have selected the wall and right click, assign new material same
so, i am just using this one, you can change the material and so if i just copy tab and that same
tab will appear here and as you can see you can just drag this to have a better view, so you have
the metalness which is zero okay fine weight will just increase its brightness and contrast, so
rest thing is i will don’t have to change it and you can also modify according to your need,
but right now we will focus on the multi pass rendering so, that’s a simple set up and will
select this part, assign new material, same ai standard surface, will change the colour to
so, for multi pass rendering you have to just make sure that you have light, and
somehow darker little bit of darker as compared to this one and select this part, press f,
select all of them, assign new material
this final thing, which is the bed part to surface and will just
little bit of this colour so, we have this scene and right now as you can see will select
all of them, and just go to window and outliner make sure that will just put in one layer and
we have just hided this one so, we will just select this shift h to unhide it, and now what
happens next will go to the render settings, arnold is there, okay no problem common
so, in preset we have hd, so at first i will go to six forty, four eighty for the examine purpose,
so at first just go to the render settings and here you can see render using arnold,
so, at first i will examine it now, what happens? see, if you are
working in the multi pass rendering, you don’t have to disturb the camera because
if the camera is been disturbed, then if you are going to the compositing software,
then all the things will be disturbed that means you don't have to disturb the camera,
camera will be in its position so, that means whatever you wanna render in multi pass rendering,
that means ambient occlusion, diffuse, beauty pass and reflection, refraction, shadow and all
you just have to just render it in one camera, and even if you have two or three camera,
you don’t have to displace the camera because each and every render sequence should follow that
particular camera without have any prior changes after when you are getting the rendering so, that
means if you are rendering in a scene, and if the camera is setting on that particular scene, so,
so i am using arnold right now so, what i will do? i will just make a simple light which is a sky
after that you don't have to change its position so, when you go to compositing software, all the
things which you have rendered in three d software will come one by one in each and every layer
and will just compact in this particular one that means you have to change the blending mode
and just have some effects also that means combination of all the render layers in a
particular scene, which is called compositing, okay so, we will discuss this in compositing software
exactly so, we have another session, which is called multi pass compositing so, we will look
that thing in the multi pass compositing session, so, we have that one okay so, now as you can see
we have the camera which is fixed and will not use this part at first, will just check is it working
quite well or not, so just have a look so, as you can see we have just set up only this
sky dome light, and here you have the panels of sky dome light you can change the colour or you
dome light as you can see, its just form here and one more thing we have to do, i will just hide
can even put the image, it will wrap into your sky dome light okay instead of having sky dome light,
you can also use physical sun and sky, so i am just using sky dome light let’s have a look
what’s happening, so right now i think this view will be fine and for your texting you should
always go to the lower resolution, because it will take a huge amount of time if you will go to the
hd ten eighty p or seven twenty p, that will take a huge amount of time, so, i will
just select this one, six forty, four eighty because that will too low, okay this is fine and now
as you can see, here you have the launch render setup window click here, as you can see there
and all the things which is coming here so, will discuss this laterwards and at first let’s have a
look at our model so, we are not displaying the camera, a camera will set at its own position
this light for a time and control h for hiding and shift h for yeah calling the hided object,
that would be fine, so will escape it to just off the rendering,
and i think will select this part and will go to perspective
make sure that you are saving your file, so i will save, save scene as desktop,
multi multi pass, underscore zero zero one now,
so what we have to do, will just select this part and here we have the mesh light, just click over
here and just go to the attribute editor and in attribute editor you have all the features of mesh
light, so, you can have the colour and all copy tab and just look at it, light visibility on and
now you can see the light is quite bouncing and also we have the shadows and all
which is generating here and if i just escaped this,
that means unhide any particular one so, at first you can see we have a camera here,
by increasing or decreasing the value, that means you have to follow the node which is this and
this one so, one by one you can experiment the same, so one more thing we have to do
you have the shadow density, make sure that cast shadow is on, okay fine and so here is the shadow
so, this would be fine you can increase the lights as you know each and every light the
process of light and all, so you can use this short of lights, which is present by default
so, arnold is a third party plug-in, so right now what else we needed? so, this would be fine,
you can also use the area light kind of area light and photometric light, okay light portal and all
so, as you can see here is the area light, you can use the area light here, so, right now
so i will just go to the panel, perspective and render camera so, i will set this to view here
﻿hi everyone, so as you can see there is a huge amount of grains because i have just decreased
occlusion, we have just you can say changed the blending mode to linear burn, and here also
we have changed the darker color so, like this way you have the render layers, you can work for
the same and after that when it’s done, make sure that you will select all of them make a copy,
right click, merge layers so, all the layers is been merged in
one and just go to filter, and i will just put surface blur because
you can say that we haven’t work in the grains and all so, i will use the surface blur
and will okay, the same, so as you can see it’s quite different
here we have some amount of jerkiness, but after getting blurred, it will just
fade outing and so you can increase the camera aa, which is inside maya, so just go to the
settings, and you can just go to arnold renderer and just increase the camera aa so, you will have a
smooth result, so like this way you can work and also you can just have different settings
like levels, curves, which will allow you to do manual color collection and just
move it like this and you can see that there is a huge changes, so, it depends on you can put it
according to your need and like this way you will just put the layers one by one,
into any of the compositing software, like photoshop, after effect and nuke, fusion like
this okay photoshop is a image based compositing software, so you can also work with the photoshop
and after effect and premier and you can say the fusion is all are the
video based compositing software so, you can also make videos in photoshop,
because you have the timeline here you can see the timeline, you can just put the time
images, here one by one and it will just produce a complete short of image sequence,
save now, we have saved the image and what i will do? i will just go to the this one render
which you can work as a video file so, like this way you can
work in the photoshop hope you understand the same, let’s meet to the next session
settings, and just create a new layer will rename this ambient occlusion ao, and now for ambient
occlusion, i just need only this this model and what i will do? as you can see we have already
used textures and all, not textures but the shader and this <?>1:53</?> change the colour
of the shader and also the shader is little bit of shininess and also we have just used this
mesh light here so, will override this, so what i will do? right click,
create collection and after that right click, here you the create material override but at first
will just add the models, as you can see we have added the models, so
will create material override and in material override when you just create
the value of camera aa as it is taking very much amount of time, so i just putted only three
the material override, you found this thing so, just click over here in arnold, in shader,
in surface which is present inside the arnold, shader and surface
you have ai ambient occlusion, so i just putted the ambient occlusion so, as you can see,
ok now will just click this on, as you can see it’s just applied on your scene, but still we
have this light i think which is applied here, will just open this, here is the table bulb and
here is the light so, now as you can see if i go to beauty and just on the eye, you will find
the colour of the beauty which we have did it and if i go to ao and just open the eye, we find the
colour of the ao, which we have did it so, like this way you can just
put some layers and all, and after that what i will do? i will just go to the this
so, you can increase this, but it will really takes few hours to render a particular image
as you can see it’s rendering and also the value or you can play with the ambient
occlusion value and all it will automatic update all the things inside your scene,
so, like this way you can add some values and also you can work with them and also we have
this panels which is kept at the top so, you can also do it well, you have all the freedoms
so, as you can see the ambient occlusion render has done and also we have this panel,
you can increase this if you need more intensity and brightness and contrast so,
you can increase this according to your need and i will just save this file, so,
ao would be fine and jpg, okay so multipass rendering, save
so, what i will do? i will just create a new layer and just putted the bounciness pass,
bounce and also the glossiness
so, i just decreased this because you know what is camera aa and diffuse, specular and all,
so, here we have the great collection and after that what i will do now?
i will just go to this pass and at first go to beauty and just select the
bedroom and ai sky, one more thing we have to do
just click here and i think we have just deleted that part, so the light part, so what i will do?
go to the perspective select this part and
go to the light bulb, so mesh light, and after that will increase the
exposure and also the intensity by two so, let’s have a look,
one more thing we have to do, will just go to the bounce glossy and will select all the parts
and will go to material override and in material override will go to arnold shader surface,
you can increase the value and it will take time so, for this only, for multi pass rendering,
so, here we have all the things so, right now what i will use?
i will just use this standard surface, which will have only one colour, as you can see which have
only one colour so, right now what happens if i just increase the metalness? as you can see
it’s getting quite dull, and we don’t require the roughness
so, as you can see we have rendered this bounce and glossiness pass
and as you can see its have all the reflection, and light is bouncing so, it’s also producing
some amount of reflection over here, and this shadow basically here and here so, you can
see the shadow which is generating from here, it’s quite just having a casting over here
and light is also bouncing in the wall and it’s also in low quality render, because
i just putted the value which is lower as you can see, and will render the same
we have decreased the value of camera aa so, that it will just fast the process of rendering,
so, we have one more render that’s not important, but you can do it well if you know the process,
we have one more render which is the wireframe render so, select all the things
and will go to the settings again and make a new so, you can just off this all of them and
click over here, right click, create collection and add all the things
so, after that will rename this
wireframe and what else we have to do? just go to the create material override
and click here and just go to the arnold, shader, surface and here you have the ai wireframe
as you can see when will go to the panel perspective camera and just render for a test,
so, as you can see we have just rendered this and you can have all the things like
you can see all the things is in wireframe so, this renders we don't need it, but yeah,
you can do it, you know the process, you can do it, so i will save this
so, now as you can see we have rendered all the images one by one, and with this
image you can also go to your compositing software and do the multipass compositing
so, we will discuss the multipass compositing and how you can achieve a good result
in the compositing classes so, with that compositing class you may have the idea,
how you can just combine all the images in one and create a particular scene from that particular
images, and also it will produce a good result by combining all those images,
and just blend it according to the need so, let’s switch to the next session
hi everyone, so in this session we will see that how we have just imported all the
gain gamma here, which is also present here you can just increase or decrease
images into the photoshop and will start just play around the blending modes and will look at the
result of this particular so, now as you can see we have just rendered all the image from the
maya two thousand eighteen and we have used this, which is the render setup and we have just
make separate layers and just putted all the information data like the model,
and the light including this particular light so, after that we have rendered separately,
so as you can see, here, we all the datas this is the beauty pass, this is the ambient occlusion,
this is the glossiness and this is the wireframe so, we don’t need wireframe because wireframe is
basically for having information about the you can say the edges and all
so, we don't need wireframe and whenever you are inputting some image into your photoshop
should rename at first so, double click,
according to your need, if you wanna put some gain and gamma on your scene you can go to
change this texture according to your need and also you can work with the grains and
all you can increase the camera aa to have a good result and have a smooth result so,
what we are getting here? if i go to ambient occlusion
on this and will just go to normal, click here and just move the down arrow as you
can see, your blending mode is working quite well, we have linear burn and you can just switch from
here and in this one so, if i open this, you can go, click here, and just move your arrow button,
you can see whole scene will change so, that’s the main fundamental of blending mode,
so your whole scene will change, so, you can put according to your need if i drag this,
you can see, that the particular part is getting dragged control z so, like this way ambient
﻿hello everyone, and welcome to this session of color theory so, what is color theory?
subtractive primitives you can actually project the additive color to produce the subtractive
subtractive primaries are based on ink color of cmyk black is abbreviated "k" by tradition,
perhaps because it is the "key" color in color printing, you need black to make the color
vibrant and snappy that is why the subtractive process is also called the four-color process,
producing color separation or "seps " color used as the process color
note that the effect in the ink in the subtractive system acts like a filter,
beginning with the white paper, all colors so, if you plane cyan ink and magenta ink over the paper,
what do you get? cyan green-blue, so transmits those colors, and absorbs red magenta red and
blue, so transmits those colors, and absorb green but, red has already been absorbed
by the cyan, so the only color left to transmit is blue, result would be blue
can be defined as a pleasant arrangement of parts, whether it will be music, poetry color or even an
question is the first you combine cyan, magenta, and yellow, what do you get?
or a muddy brown inks are not put and it’s impossible to get a good black by mixing them,
hence the addition of black in the cmyk system printer use the four color system, called process
color, as a way to avoid using a spot color for each color specific by the illustration
with only the four colors, cmyk, we can generate all colors the process color
system does not actually makes the color on a page, one atop the step instead the color are
deposit overlapping each other, in a pattern at a precise angle we mix the color in our mind to
set the desired color in this way, each color forms a dot, similar to the half tone process
used for black and white "continuous tone", which is called contone generate, as for photos
here we can see a close up of a half tone pattern note the <?>closer</?>
color visualization so, in visual experiment
the dots, the more overlap, and the darker the color from farther away,
it looks like gray four color separations and the half tones are printed by screen then into dots
the smaller the dots, the finer the resolution, this is expressed in dpi, dots per inch
similarly, the resolution on computers is expressed in ppi pixel per inch,
the two are related generally, we need to save photos as a double ppi of the dpi specified
for example, many magazine quality publication require about one hundred thirty three dpi called
a one thirty three line screen this means photo need to be saved at a
resolution of two sixty six ppi to be of acceptable quality publication on newsprint
or other low quality stock are printed at fifty five or sixty five line screens to avoid dot gain
this is why they don't look as high quality as those in magazines “dot gain” means that
color harmony is sometimes is a pleasant to the eye, so, it follows all the colors which
as the ink soaks into low quality paper, it get bigger, giving the photo a muddy look
the ink must soak into lower quality paper to allow it to dry quickly, because newspapers
are quickly printed and distributed within hours magazines often are printed on coat
stock shiny paper that does not allow into ink to soak, instead dries more slowly by oxidation
this keeps the fine details sharp, but a printer has to let the publication dry, because
before it can be distributed consider the color dot pattern at left,
the higher the dot, the more likely fine detail will be muddy
this close up shows a color screening process note cyan atop yellow appears as green magenta
on yellow appears orangeish red the color separate must be created and printed with
a high degree of accuracy, to produce a quality printed product, this requires skilled printers
gets extracted in a single <?>wheel</?> so, color harmony develop visual interest
recall that a piece of paper must be run through an offset press four times to print process color,
once for each print ink, plus black if the paper is run through at a
slightly different angle, the color won't overlap properly a color ghost may be seen on an edge,
and color will be muddy this is called out of registration registration problems
are particularly common in publication printed and distributed quickly, such as newspaper
in magazines and quality publication, graphic artist and photographers may prefer to see
proof copies of color separated to check color quickly they may also prefer to
go to the printer at the beginning of a run, to check color quality off the press
here from a recent minneapolis star tribune outstate edition,
we see a major registration problem it probably was fixed by the time the metro
as a sense of order, in summer extremely unity leads to under simulation extreme complex,
edition appeared we can say that color theory can be related to color generated system or
color harmony color harmony may be considered by three hue, value and saturation hue is the name
of the color, determined by the wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum the munsell color wheel
sets up five primary hues: red, yellow, green, blue and purple the value of the degree of
lightness or darkness of a color, in paint, we mix black to dark a color called a shade,
and white to light a color, called a tint saturation or intensity is a measure of the colors
perceived purity or brightness, munsell called the chroma
we can choose color harmony based on complementary color on a color wheel a color wheel
guide a color choice as a described in this youtube video, so you have the link
some general guidelines for choosing color: difference will be emphasized
lead to the over simulation so, color harmony is a dynamic equilibrium,
for example, yellow surrounded by green will tend to appear more yellow, green surrounded by yellow
will tend to appear more green this is the rule of simulation contrast warm color appear
to advance, cool color appear to recede we can use this perception to add a feeling
of dimension reds tend to dominate in a design research show the favorite color of most americans
is blue green in america is associated with bitterness, brown is associated with maleness
this means, for example, that sugar will tend not to sell in a green packet,
and women's cosmetics will tend not to sell in a brown packet when choosing spot color,
consider a spot color for a graphic or clip art consider a spot color for all headlines,
subheads, drop caps, et-cetera create screened background using a spot color
keep your publication unified by choosing a single color for all headlines,
color theory in compress a multitude of definition concept and design, applications,
drop caps, et-cetera you can screen the color variety
and have to field several encyclopedias however, there are three basic categories
of color theory that are logically are used the color wheel, the color statics and the content
of how color are used, color theory create a logically structure of color for example,
color theory is both the science and the art of color, it explains how human precise color
if we have an <?>assignment</?> of food and vegetable, we can organize them by color,
and placed them on a circle that shows the color in related to each other
color of course, is simple visible wavelength from the electromagnetic spectrum also a part
of spectrum is infrared, ultraviolet, radio waves and x-ray black is not a color black is the
absence of color, obviously! but historically people really did think black was a color
experimentally in physics proved that it would be a false, black nevertheless has strong
visual weight in an image or design color temperature is another vital consideration
in design, by distinguishing between warm color and cool color, a neutral color we can
appropriately have the power to evoke emotional response in people warm color are those which
shades of yellow and red, cool color have a blue, green and purple tint,
how color makes, matches or clashes? the <?>0:34</?> and other cultural messages color communicate and
neutral color include brown, gray, black and white while these group holds true in
a general sense emotionally response to color can also be heavily affected by gender, experiences,
cultural, associations and other people personal factors consequentially research
<?>retrace</?> expectation of target audience is vital, for not only fine
tune the positive impact of color used in a design, but also preventing design failure
if you add all the visible wavelength together, you will get white light
we can prove this obviously by using a prism, a prism separates white light in two wavelength
so, a rainbow is simple as a prism of raindrops separating sunlight into wavelength white light
actually has a slight color cast this is due to either the color temperature of the source,
or the wavelength is missing higher temperature light is bluer,
the method using to replicate color so, we can talk about color using two kinds of terminology,
lower temperature is redder, so, the expression in color temperature using the kelvin scale
this photo shows three different color temperatures: the sunlight through the window
is highest, the incandescent light shining on the figure is warmer, the fire is warmer
or lowest color temperature sunlight is about five thousand five hundred degree
kelvin electronic flash is about six thousand degree kelvin, so
slightly blue incandescent light is about three thousand degree kelvin, so
orangeish candle light is about two thousand four hundred degree kelvin, so reddish
note the reddish cast to candle light, compared with the bluish cast of a sunny day
some light is missing whole area of the spectrum fluorescent light, for example, is often missing
warm colors, and so may look rather sickly greenish blue of course, digital camera
first, is the color generation system and the second is the color harmony
will adjust for color cast, to an extent and we can adjust it in photoshop as we have learned
sometimes we do not want to talk the color completely out of <?>context</?>
however candle light should look warm in addition to color cast, graphic artists and
photographers need to understand how color is generated by machines we used such as
computer, television, and printing press we generate colors in two ways - the additive
system, the subtractive system the additive system begin with the absence of color, that is
black, and add colors to that to reach the color we want it is based on three additive primaries-
red, green, and blue, which is called rgb system additive colors is used in projected systems, such
as television and computer monitors, and movies consider the computer monitor a monitor projects
color based on three "guns" of variable voltage one each of r, g and b, the more intense the
system so, what is color generation system? so, the color generation system is the available
voltage, the more intense the color projected these voltages are expressed in numbers from zero,
black or no color to two hundred fifty five most intense color voltages are projected as phosphor
(light sensitive) dots on a screen check out computer screen with a magnifying glass,
you will see all actually made of square dots, called picture elements or pixels
obviously, zero and zero and zero voltage will produce black, white two
fifty five, two fifty five and two fifty five will produce white other color depend on a combination
of intensities of rgb keep in mind the color is not actually mixed on the screen it is either
on or off, based on by its color or no color each pixel has a certain number of bits that can
be display a color most modern computer monitors can transmit the true color or twenty four bit
color this means each channel rgb contains eight bit per channel that can transmit color
color system are depend on the medium, with which a designer is working when painting and the
eight bits means the channel can make eight combination of on or
off of the color, per pixel, two fifty six colors total you have three channels,
how many color can be generated? two fifty six into two fifty six, into two fifty six equals to
one crore sixty seven lakh seventy seven thousand two hundred sixteen possible colors
eight bit color also exists, two fifty six color total they are called “web-safe” color,
because they are sure to render accurately on anyone's monitor nowadays we don't have
to worry about that much, below eight bit and twenty four bit color are been there
you also can have thirty two bit color, even forty eight bit color the last one
has two hundred eighty one trillion color, far more than the eye can scan but, it is usually
in some printing techniques, or so i have read additive color is really handy in
artist has a variety of paint to choose from and mix color and <?>acrive</?> through the sub act
projected applications but it does not work in printed application, that is, ink or paper
additive color won't work for printing because we can't begin with black we must begin with a piece
of paper that is usually a white white, as we know is all colors, so we can't add to all colors,
we must subtract furthermost, an offset printing press can't generate the enormous
number of color available on a computer screen we need to run a piece of paper through the
press for each ink the press below has four heads, one of each ink in cmyk system the
color system used by scientist and artists are entirely different an artist will makes blue
and yellow paint to get a shade of green a scientist will make green and red light to
create yellow, the <?>painted</?> page in magazine is yet another system it is important to define
the two different kind of color that we can see in the world as the first step is understanding
color mentioned when a designer is utilized the computer to generate digital media, color
color system, first there is the color that you can touch such as the skin of an apple
or a painted wall these color are a part of the sub space of an object, next there is the
color you can’t touch, such as beam of light and the color produced by your computer monitor
color generated by light are a part of the color system, the tangible color, which are on
the surface of an object or the printed page are another color system the following illustration
and description define the different color system, has a four head one of each ink in cmyk system
the printed color, therefore, is based on the subtracting system
while the additive primaries used to generate all colors are rgb, beginning with black
the subtractive primaries are cyan, magenta, yellow and black cmyk and begin with white
cyan blue-green, magenta yellow-blue, yellow red-green, note the relationship between the additive and the
are archived with the active color method what is color harmony system? it is the harmony which
hello, welcome to module thirty seven
vfx is generally understood as the combination of live action footage and imagery created
outside the context of a live action shoot
vfx shots range from basic image manipulation and compositing, integration of live action
with cg to full cg environments which look realistic
visual effects commonly aimed to create photo realistic and believable images
the two most common vfx shots scenarios are, set extension and cg integration
in set extension, we shoot the foreground on green screen and then extend the background set
whereas, in cg integration we first shoot the background and then integrate the cg objects
once of the vfx part is done, the foremost important aspect that is compositing comes
in picture
in the previous class we had discussed science of colors, where we focused that understanding
in compositing we integrate our cg with the background live action
the point one should consider while compositing is matching the colors, shadows, atmosphere,
sharpness, motion blur, grain and artifacts, lens distortion, et-cetera
gamma, saturation, shadow mild tones, highlights, taking individual <?>paths</?>, et-cetera
shadow matching means tweaking the color, intensity and softness of shadows
atmosphere means adding foreground atmosphere elements such as very subtle smoke, light
wrap node, et-cetera
sharpness focuses defocusing the cg to match background
motion blur, an important aspect because camera motion creates motion blur, the amount depends
of color theory is essential for the science of animation
on the shutter and the speed of the motion
render cg with motion blur or use of vector pass to create the motion blur in nuke
grain and artifacts that is matching the grain, compression artifacts and chroma effect, and
lens distortion refers to add the lens distortion node created by the camera <?>tracker</?>
to distort the cg
so, let’s switch on to the application and the start the compositing
here in this module, we will be introducing about visual effect that is vfx and compositing
vfx has advanced tremendously in last few centuries, the rapid advancement in the computer
graphics technologies and techniques
in the late twentieth and early twenty first century gave those models, miniatures and
puppets a way to the world of three d computer generated imaginary
full three d world
﻿hello everyone so, in this session, we will understand the concept of compositing inside after effects
then it will form a single layer and you can't compose in after-effects so, i will not merge
the layer i will just put separately okay now, what happens? see, if i go to control again,
we do the same process which we have did it earlier and we will press the alt and go to auto
key and just go to the find darker and lighter colours again, okay one more thing we have to do,
we will delete this part and we will just off this because that's
the reference thing which we want to do so, i will just put it somehow at the centre
and by holding control and just click over here, go to this part, levels and
by holding alt, same thing which we have did it, find dark and lighter colour click over here,
and i prefer to have manually adjustment which would be better for me
so, as you can see, i am doing the manual adjustment and we’ll put some lighter colour here,
one thousand also and also your image size will change if you increase by five-hundred
just drag this and we will make some amount of darker no problem we will select both of them
at first, we will select both of them, will increase
sorry, we will click all of them, we will move it somehow here and what else we will do?
in that and we will save the file so, as you can see, we have created this amount of thing
now, we will switch to the next session and we will add some more things in this, because we
have the trees and this part, we have the castle and this branch is also followed by the moon
and some sort of different trees and also the clouds so, we will add more images and
we will do the colour correction in the next session so, let's switch to the next session
see, your image size changes to sixty-nine-point two mb so, right now, i am using
three hundred resolution, okay fine and the width and height so, i will change the width to sixteen
and i will change the height to nine so, i will work in the landscape so, we’ll open
it okay colour mode rgb is fine eight bit of colour mode, background is white, okay
image size is thirty- seven-point one mb okay so, i will hit on okay so, as you can see
the blank image has formed, which is the background and it is white
and, i will open this lock by double clicking it so, as you can see, we have all the images inside
this folder which is the matte folder so, i will put one by one so, at first,
i will take the cloud within which would be the background of our matte painting okay
so, as you can see, we have a couples of different images which i have downloaded and
so, i will just click the cloud and drag to the photoshop just put it over here as you can see,
if i just click here and just move and want to increase the size you can see it's
not increasing in proportional way it's not working in the proportional, so what i will do? i
will just go to control z and just shift pressing again and we’ll click one of the boundaries
so, you can see now, it's working and also increasing in proportional way, okay
so, what i will do? i will press enter now, it has been set, so i will move it little bit
upward, okay so, make sure that you are saving your file so, i will save it; so
matte a underscore zero zero one, okay so, i will save it matte a now,
what else we have to do? i will just right click and rasterize the same
what is rasterize? as you can see here it's forming the logo so, you can't do anything as you
most of them are png so, what i will do? i will make a quick matte painting inside photoshop and
can see, i have taken the brush, you can't even paint it, okay so, it will produce some error
so, right now, what i will do? i will just go to here and right click and
rasterize layer now, you can easily paint or do anything you want in your photo
so, okay, now we have set the cloud and i will just use this one, which is the
plane region so, i will just put it somehow here, no problem, okay now, what i will do? rasterize
the same, and i will use the eraser tool, we’ll increase the opacity and i am using this soft
eraser so, okay, by bracket, which is just beside the p, you can increase or decrease the size or
even you can go over here to increase or decrease the size so, that would be hectic that means you
have to just go over here and there so, i think we should use the bracket,
which is beside p so, i will just erase its boundary part so, i'm not using the mask,
we’ll turn that matte painting into after effects and just put all the images in after effects
i'm only using the eraser, as you can see, okay so, this would be fine, i think, okay
i will modify it laterwards so, we’ll just move it here and we have some garbage material also
if i off this, you can see the small parts which is forming here and one thing we have
noticed that, this part we don't need it so, what i will do? i will just go to this layer
and just go to the clone tool here, we have the clone tool and what i will do? so, make sure
that you are using the soft clone brush and if you press spacebar you can move your image easily
so, i will take the reference here so, by taking the reference you should have to press alt, click
and just paste the same reference as you notice, there is forming a plus sign over here, okay
that means it's taking the reference of that particular section okay
so, i will just make some amount of background thing like dragging my clone tool here
so, at first, i have to make the painting inside the photoshop with the help of these images
so, you have to click and click like this way,
okay make sure that you are saving your file that is very important
now, what i will do? i will go to nine in a layer and we found these humans
so, we will remove this so, i will put some background thing like,
removing like this, and we’ll click and we’ll just put some random thing, okay
and, you have just putted some random thing, and you see here, these are fine
so, all the things are fine
okay i have putted some random cloning so, okay what i will do? as you can see,
the colour is not matching properly so, we have something over here, okay now, as you
can see the colour is not matching properly what i will do? i will just select this layer,
so, i will create a scenery which is known as matte painting so, let’s get started so, now i'm
which is this one so, by holding control, i will click over here so, it will produce this kind of
selection and now i will go to here as you can see, by clicking over here
you have the levels, okay so, i have to match the colour i will take the reference of this cloud
so, as you can have this auto, so, by holding your alt button if you hold your alt,
you can click in the auto now, a new window will form, which has auto colour correction option
so, at first what i will do? i will just click over here, find dark and light colours as
you can see, it changed quite well okay final graph also changed and it's affecting
your image also you can switch, okay now, i will take the shadow and we’ll choose that
colour i will just manually, i can manually select that colour also, by moving somehow here,
opening my photoshop as you can see, i am using cs six now, i will import all the image one by
okay now, we will click the okay save the new target colour as default- no,
because i don't need that particular kind of colour in default way so, right now, i am
in rgb mode so you can select any of them but, i prefer to work in master, so i will just drag this
and will, as you can see its matching quite well and like this way you can match easily okay
so, okay now, it's at the top so, i will select both of them by holding control right click merge
layers so, the layers has been merged, okay i will do colour correction laterwards in after
effect also, and we will save the file right now, what i needed, i needed this this particular
mountain and we will drag it to photoshop and just put it somewhere here by holding shift,
centre and now right-click rasterize layer so, i will go to my eraser tool and what i will
one and i will set it according to my needs so, i will go to file, new and we will go to the
do? i will decrease the opacity so, now i will just remove like this
and okay no problem control t and move it little bit downward, okay fine so, as you can see,
okay i will just decrease the opacity a little bit and just move like, okay no problem
so, with this you can have a good understanding how you can compose different images into one
so, as you can see, we have just putted this one and i will just off this level one,
which we have created the ground and with the help of this image, this one so, i will just off this,
because i need the background reference so, again i will click on holding control
button click over here, you can see we have selected this part and we’ll go over here
so, here you have the levels again by holding alt and auto, and find darker and lighter,
so shadow will be manually adjusted it, because its better to manual adjust, okay,
international paper now, i will change it to centimeters or inches will be fine so, a four i
and we will on this and just do the by clicking over here you can have that particular section
so, you can work quite well okay so, by holding both of them,
merge layers okay, no problem now, what i will do? i will just put some random clouds over here,
but at first, i have to make the mountains here so, the mountains would be much more
darker as compared to this one so, we will make some mountains with both of them
so, we will take this one and just put it somehow here
so, that would be i think this part would be fine so, what i will do? right click, flip horizontal
so, i will just put it somehow here okay enter, and right click, rasterize
and make sure that you will not merge all the layers because, if you merge all the layers
am using as you can see resolution is three hundred as you can increase by five hundred, and
﻿hello everyone so, in this session we will add some more images
let's have a look and we'll change the level, same because we have to match all the things which is
coming across here so, okay, one more thing we have forgotten so, i will just delete the same,
do it again because we have to work in the colour exactly we have to work in the colour
so that's very important, okay so, now, we have to define the colours that part we have leaved
now, both of them selected by holding control merge layers and if if you go this part,
this is the blending mode you can just switch, and just use your arrow key, you can blend
i think this part looks quite well and use the opacity, little down and also, one more thing you
have to do i will just select this part, isolate the same by holding alt, you can click over here,
all the things will be gone so, i'm using the lasso tool and now i will increase my feather by,
okay press enter i think, we have to scale it a little bit
i think five because we need some amount of fader at its corner
so, what happens? so, i will just remove this part like, selecting all the parts like
this random movement okay you don't have to work accuracy if you are cutting the clouds,
you can also have a random movement, okay that would be fine, no problem so, i will
okay let's have a look, how we can fix this yeah, definitely we have to fix this so,
i will just remove this part because, we don't need this part and now, i will
yeah, it's working quite well so,
let's switch to the next session because we have to add
now, what i will do? right click, rasterize layer, press control, and click over here
some more images here i think one tree would be fine and after that, we have to define the colour
and the, yeah, the foreground thing would be much more contrast and have darker colours and
control d, i just move it some over here so, okay, control press and just go to
the levels, but at first, just off all them and we'll go to the levels and just
<?>repressing</?> alt, which is same, which we have did it earlier
and, we'll take the colour like somehow here and we'll take this colour to somehow here okay
and we'll go to here and just move it somehow here and just select both of them,
merge layers as you can see, these layers has been merged and
after that, when we have done with placing our images then we will do the renaming purposes
in this matte painting so, let's start
so, what i have here, i have the clouds, which is this one so, we'll move one by one and just
okay i think, here this would be fine and we'll move this like this way
so, i'm stretching it, okay no problem, so i have to move the cloud like this
so, we'll go to eraser and at first, rasterize the same and will decrease the opacity
and we'll just randomly use my eraser to just randomly
software and this part also we need one cloud so, i have another cloud, both are different so,
will decrease the size and we'll put somehow here,
okay that thing has the opacity level high so, what i will do? i will just duplicate it,
now, what i will do, i will just go to my previous folder, which we have taken the matte paintings, a
control z, only two times,okay, merge layer how you can duplicate? by control j,
you can duplicate easily or by clicking and dragging into this copy layer and
you can duplicate the same so, there are couple more different things to duplicate
so, right click and duplicate layer here, you can have the duplicate okay
so, like this way you can duplicate i prefer to duplicate with control j, this would be fine
okay now, what i will do? i will turn the opacity little bit down okay, fine
and we'll go to the eraser and we'll erase the same, little bit of it, little bit of fadedness,
no problem this part needs, good and this part need to be work, okay no problem okay
now, so we have this thing, this one and we will just put some trees over here
so, what i will do? i will just go to that in particular one and just put it one tree i think,
images which we have downloaded, okay now, i will just select this part and we'll move to photoshop
this would look quite well i think, if i put it like this what happens? see,
if i want to put like this is it work or not? let's have a look rasterize, remove all of them,
control clicking, so i am doing the same thing which we have did it many times,
okay so, we'll select the colour manually that would be better and just going here,
okay and no we'll just drag this down, we'll move this little bit
so, we’ll on all them, that would be fine as you can see, it's quite merging
make merge layers, control s for saving now, this time we'll save in next version,
which is the another version so, version is very important if you have just doing something and
just your file gets crashed and you can go to the previous version to have that particular data
so, you don't have to work from starting if you don't make any version, if your file get crashed,
and we'll keep somehow over here so, what i will do? right click and flip horizontal
everything will be gone so, make sure that you will make two or three versions more
than that, it would be better for you so, so this way we have made and what else
we have to do? i just want this part to be little bit of fade, so, i will just, that means it just
ejected from this mountain, like this way, okay so, it's looking quite well now and, we'll do
one more thing we’ll just put this castle, and somehow here so, we have to work out for
now, rasterize the same and, if you have the auto selection, then you can click any of the
image it will directly go to that particular layer, okay if your auto selection is not on,
that thing never worked see, we have selected this cloud if you click,
it will not go to that particular layer so, auto selection by clicking and checking this,
so, we'll press shift and just scale it down a little bit this would be fine, and
you can just directly go to any of the layer, okay otherwise what you have to do,
right click the thing which come at the top which that particular layer, right click
level two, so like this way you can work so, i prefer to work in auto selection,
that would be better so, okay this part so, what i will do? i will just go to the lasso tool, by
holding your left mouse button you can switch to any of the tools by holding left mouse button
so, i am going to lasso tool as this is a freehand tool, as you can see, you can work like this
control d for de selection or if you are working in polygon, that would be hectic if you have
irregular shapes like this mountain so, i prefer to have the lasso tool and
we’ll go and have the feather to around one, so that its corners would be faded and have a
good result so, right now what i will do? i will just off this castle for a while and
we'll move it like this, and we'll rotate it
go to lasso tool and just select this part like moving like this and what i will do now? i
will just go and control j for the same, but at first, i have to select that particular layer,
control j and move it upward so, as you can see, we have moved upward and
the castle is hiding and what else we have to do? just move it somehow here,
okay, that would be fine and now we have to do the tweaking so, i will use the eraser and just
work in the opacity so, we'll just work in the opacity
so, i'm erasing in this part and after that what else we have? we will just ease this part also
okay now, colour correction, we need to work in the colour, that's very important so,
for that, what else we have to do? this part is fine, oh that's creating
double thing so, we'll move it okay fine and now, we have to work in the colour correction
so, as you can see, this part need to be work out so control t again for transformation,
so, we'll off all this only this one is fine and we'll select this one,
okay here we have the problem
control alt z, because we have just moved this one also so, we'll select this layer and just
move it erase the same and right click twelve, by holding control again, we go to the same process
level and by holding alt, click over here now, darker and lighter colour, click and just
go to that particular colour, no problem select, go to that particular colour,
i think mashed and okay fine so, we have to work in this part so, what i will do? i will just
erased this and control s to save it again and now, i will use this moon, so we'll drag this
press shift and just move it okay, fine as you can go here, your cursor changes,
as you can see, this is not a png image, because we have the background
so, what else you have to do? we'll just keep at the top and for a while rasterize layer and
we'll use this ellipse marquee tool, so with no feather i am using this ellipse marquee-tool
if you hold shift, you have a particular and accurate circle if you leave your shift, you have a oval,
yeah oval shapes, by holding shift and, in space, where you can move your
marquee tool by holding shift and spacebar, okay so, like this way, okay now,
one more problem we have if i delete this, then the centre part will gone, control z so, what i
have to do? i have to do the inverse delete so, for that control shift and i control shift and i,
and after that delete the same, control d so, we have do the inverse delete so,
i will put somehow over here that would be fine, i think, that would be work quite well
as you can see, that's for rotating purpose and just put it some over here,
﻿hi everyone so, in this session we will put some more images and will seriously work
according to your need, or you can go to window and if you check, then that panel will be
open here, okay so, as you can see all the things are here if you just close this render coil,
and if you go to window and just open this, it will directly come to your screen okay
paragraph, this is basically for managing your typing thing
into after effects so, it has some sort of layouts and also it has some sort of parameters
effects and pre-sets is very important, whatever you want to take effects if you want to work in
colour and if you want to work in three d or even blur or distort, you can go directly to here
this is basically for typing purposes so, this will work with this one, basically paragraph
like this, you can just edit your screen, have some more space, okay
these are the tools and these are the sub tools, which have all the things,
okay so, we will select both of them, rasterize layer and we will merge the same
whatever you want to make in after effect now, what happens? see, if i call all my images,
i will just call all my images and i will drag this in after effect, directly put it over here,
you have to put it in the project window so, you can put all the images in the project window,
or even the video, or even the files, compositing files, after effect will directly can take the
photoshop file also so, it supports the photoshop file so, you have all the layers and all the
things so, here you have the effect control, so you can control your effects from this panel
now, what i will do? i will at first select the ground, so i know this is not my base,
but i will first select the ground it's not showing over here, because you have to drag on the
timeline and now it is showing as you can see, whenever you just put it here,
it form a new panel this is for a sequence this is basically for sequence and composition
so, we have both of them which has been merged and now, we will select this by holding control
as you can see, here also you have the option create a new composition, that is the sequence and
composition so, it will just play like this so, now it's playing two thirty seconds if you
hit on spacebar, it will play if you hit spacebar again, it will stop or you can go here okay
by clicking away, it can play like this you can go per frame,
it will jump to the last and it will jump to the first, okay so, if you want to increase the
timeline, so what you have to do? go to composition, here you have the
composition and here you have the composition settings so, as you can see, we have width
four thousand eight hundred pixels, and height two thousand seven hundred pixels, okay
you can change it according to your need so, you have the pre-sets, you can work in hdv high-definition
video or hdtv or even four k or two k so, that's same as that of premiere, but it has many panels
same, we will go to level and just put it the alt and click it over here and just go to
as compared to the premiere so, if you're familiar with premiere
you can work in after effect, quite well so, i will show you the main features of the
after effect, because i will compose this scene so, i will make this particular thing which is in
two d form in photoshop so, i will just add some depth camera and just put layers one by one, so
you can see all the things so, here, you have the frame rate which is thirty
thirty frames per second, okay twenty-nine point ninety- seven, you can decrease this according to
your need, but that's the by default value so, duration is thirty seconds this
is the time code and as you can see, this zero stands for frames this particular section stands
for seconds, this one for minute, and the last one for hour you can see over here also, okay
now, as you can see, we have thirty seconds you can increase this
find dark and lighter colour, so like this way change the colour according to our need
or even decrease this if you need two minutes thirty seconds, so now if you drag this, you have
two minutes and thirty seconds so, if you select any of the layers, it will
highlight into lighter grey as you can see, it's only travelling two thirty seconds and after that,
it will go on so, what you will do? click over here, you can drag this like so so, that's the
feature of after effect so, by default i will put thirty i think, we don't require thirty so,
i think thirty would be fine, okay you can decrease this value, okay fine and we
will just drag this to thirty now, i will just put at the ground
i will just put this sky at the back so, you can see sky has formed so, i have just
go to the section so, in after effect also, or in any other compositing software also you have to do
the couples of adjustment so, as you can see, so i have just opened it for a quick look and now the
and we will put some lighter colour over here
mountain so, i will put one by one, okay,
no problem so, my sky will go little bit of above, i think here,
this would be fine so, i will do some more adjustment later-wards okay
now, make sure that you are saving your file, that's very important so, i will save in desktop
i will save it comping underscore zero zero one this is basically compositing
tutorial so, i have just putted the mountain now, what i will do?
i will just put the clouds, both of them at first, we will put this moon and
so as you can see, whatever you take, it will preview over here
okay so, now we will click on okay and yes, the darker colour,
moon and the overlapping cloud
just above the moon so, as you can see, we have set up this scene and
if i drag this, you will found all the things lined up in a good way, in sequence way,
okay so, save it again and there is one more switch this is toggle switch modes if we click,
you may have the blending modes as you know, we have worked in blending modes many times and
that's the blending mode if you want to go to this three d view,
toggle over here now, you have the three d view three d layer allows this layer
to be manipulated in three dimensions and also, you have the motion blur effects,
okay here, you have the motion blur effects, and this is the adjustment layer, okay so,
you can toggle your switches this is basically for blending mode if you blend this front tree,
much more darker and just select both of them and just merge layers control t and increase this
it will definitely blend with the side rock if you blend the side rock, definitely it will blend
with the cloud let's have a look this is the front tree as you can see, if i click this, that
part is selected and you can move easily at any side of your screen, okay and if i click over and
go to screen now, you can see it's just blended to the last one or it will show all the things
so, by default normal would be fine and this is basically for matte purpose, so we are not
using this okay and this is basically for linking purpose, that means parent to child
this is basically linking so, you have to just drag or link any of them as you can see,
if you're dragging, there would be a message, okay, click and just link any of them but,
we are not using we will maybe discuss it later-wards okay
so, in this tutorial, we don't require these types of things because we will work in three d so,
size and after that, what i will do? i will just erase this part so, we will take the eraser and
i will just toggle the switch so, you can toggle your switch or even you can
use your f four button on your keyboard so, you can toggle easily and switch your screen
now, we don't require to go to this particular section because we don't need blending mode
and matte things, track mat and the linking, okay and also the parent linking
so, we don't require it because we will work in three d now, as you can see, your scene is being set up
and what we will do now? we will just take some more space so, right now, we have to produce the
camera so, what i will do? right-click, new and camera so, as you can see pre-set is fifty mm,
fifty millimeter if you click over here, you will have all the pre-sets
so, i am using fifty millimeter because i need the screen to be in straightway like this
as you will go to fifteen millimeters, it will produce some bulge effect if you go
to two hundred millimeters, it will produce some curve effect so, i will put fifty millimeter,
which is by default angle of view thirty-nine point sixty okay we
don't require <?>the depth </?>and lock to zoom, okay fine, okay
it's showing the warning because camera and light does not affect two d layers
now, these all are in two d i will put never again, okay, no problem and we will put all the layers
into three d so, as you can see, we have created the camera and at first, i will save the file
now, at the top we are in selection tool so, we will go to camera, okay click, okay
now, with the help of your left mouse button, you can just
rotate so, you have a dedicated rotation tool also inside your camera if i click over here,
you have this orbital camera tool so, you can orbit your and if you go here, by click over
and we have to focus on the back part so, i will just select the level one, click over
in this particular section, which is the background so, i will just put some much
here you have, track xy camera tool okay so, as you can see it's buffering quite well
so, that's why what i will do? i will just set this full to quarter
so, it will just have some pixelate value and after that you are satisfied with the work,
you will directly switch to full, okay so, what it will do? it will pan up your whole scene okay,
and then, we have track z camera, it will zoom in and zoom out so, that's the main
thing of camera okay so, right now, i'm using this one,
orbital camera tool so, as you can see, no problem, okay
so, as you can see, if i go to full, then it will buffer because we are in full resolution
if you move little bit, then also it will buffer so, instead of using full, i will go to quarter
and when we are done with it, then we will switch to full and have a render so, what happens now? i
here and make a new layer and just put this colour in this one control d and we will change the
will just delete this camera again and just make a new camera, okay, rest is fine
and now, instead of having one view we will go to two view or you can have four view but,
that would be confusing if i click over here, you have all the things in three d way like maya so, this,
you can say this is the perspective, this is the top obviously, this is the front,
this is the right so, we required only two,
so that would be fine so, we have top and active camera so, what i will do? i will just give some
depth between them as you can see, this is the camera view and this is the top view, okay so, i
will just select this sky as you can see, we have to access, this is the z and this is the x
we will put this sky at the back later-wards, we will manage
the size this is the ground, so we will just put the ground at the back,
mode to, okay we will turn the opacity down little bit,
the overlapping cloud, we will put somehow here this is the mountain, go to the back
this is the cloud, goes somehow here this is the second cloud,
put somehow here this is the side rock,
okay and this is the front tree so, we will just put somehow here, this is the front tree
now, as you can see, we have set up the gap between them and we will
just press shift and select all of them and we will move further
okay we will just move it downward little bit now, if i select my camera,
as you can see, we have selected my camera that's the camera, and that's the focusing point
so, what i will do? i will select my camera instead of moving from here or here,
what i will do? i will go to here and just drag z camera
click and move as you can see, it will just produce some amount of depth between them
so, right now, what i will do? one more thing, i will go to zero second and what i will do?
i will just open this, you have the transform, click over here if you just drag this, you will
find that position is changing okay no problem, it would be changed so, what i will do? i will
click over here this is for animation purpose click, now particular key has formed and in
fifteen seconds, even in ten seconds, ten seconds would be fine it will go to
so, make sure that the black region will not come it will not look good so, we will just
drag this, okay so, as you can see, now you have some amount of depth
you can do it from here just zoom it and you can have that frame so, you can go directly and just
zoom out a little bit so, one more thing you can do, you can select your
key and just move if you want to move, you can move to fifteen seconds or even more, if you
need or even if you select both of them, you can move directly like this, okay
control z and because that would be fine so, i think we have to switch to the next session
let's have a look so, i'm using the arrow button,
will turn the opacity down we will put this thing here also
so, i'm making a new layer, alt backspace control d and linear dodge,
i have to match the background so, that's very important same with the tree,
more darker colour and will just select all the things which is at the background and just
so, we will select both of them, we should decrease the colour intensity we will select
this and decrease the colour intensity and also decrease colour intensity here, okay
okay rest is fine i think rest is fine we have to work for the same now, as you can see,
part to be little bit of more darker so, i will go to the levels this time,
i will just move this little bit, and you can find that it's affecting quite well, okay, no problem
so, we will select both of them, merge layers now, we have to merge the layers which we have
created like this particular colour so, we will select both of them, merge
so, we will select both of them, merge okay and now we will just
use some dull colour so, let's start now, what i will do? i will just go to my
do one more thing, rename the same so, this would be sky this would be the ground,
and this would be the mountain centre and this would be the cloud,
so, okay, we have to merge these things to the tree also
merge and now, we will merge the castle, followed by this part
so, we will select all of them, merge the same and we will just move it over here
we will merge the same that would be a particular thing, okay
so, mountain, fine so, this would be the side part and this would also be the side part
folder which we have kept so, as you can see here, we have some sort of trees also so, i just
‘m o o n’ - moon, and this would be the cloud,
overlapped cloud and that would be the tree, front tree
so, i will put this tree over here so, what i will do? i will just select this tree,
and put it over here so, as you can see it's hiding so, no problem, we will select both of
them merge layers, so we have this thing and we will just select this one, overlap cloud and moon
and we will put some more at the last, okay not so last, but i think here okay
so, one more thing we have to do we will just select the
eraser and just remove some of these parts so, define, and just select this part,
move, okay fine so, as you can see, this would be the front this would be the side front, this
that's the ground and that's the sky so, we have all the things which we have make
it and now what i will do? i will just select each and every part and we will start doing the,
yeah, we will start rendering one by one in png, so that you don't have the background,
you just have only the images so, the background would be transparent
now, what i will do? i will just select one by one and just move
so, i have this sky, so one more thing i have to do i just put this sky like here, and we will go
so, that should be in jpg, because it's an overlapping image, no problem okay, fine
now, we will take the ground of this, okay make sure that you will off all the things
not work so, i will take it, another one so, i think, this one which we have take it
and one more thing you have to do we have to do some amount of tweaking in our compositing
software also that means we have to play with the opacity in our compositing software
that would be the centre mountain, it’s saving right now so, mountain,
png,
few more to go,
save as, side rock
so, we have to take the png, save, and last one this one, front tree
so, as you can see, we have saved all the things in png and we have this thing in jpg so,
so, we will just change the flip horizontal and also, we will put it somehow here okay
you can say images, but i'm using that amount of images, as you can see we have some bushes also,
you can use it according to your need but i think that would be fine so, now, i have just rendered
this as you can see, we have all the data which is rendered in png except this one this is the
jpg and now what i will do? i will open my after effect,
okay so, now i will compose my shot in the after effect so, i'm using after effects cs six
and what i will do? i will just call each and every images one by one, and we will start working
in the after effect as you can see, the after effect has been opened, and you are watching the
graphic user interface of the after effect so, this is by default the graphic user interface
of the after effect so, whatever you want to make, it will show on the compositing screen
this is the composition screen, and here you have to call your projects or images or even videos,
so, now what i will do? i will just press alt and just move it here so, have duplicate copy
okay and this would be your timeline and it's a layer-based software like photoshop
that means photoshop has the layer like this and same after effect have layer
so, we will discuss this and this step basically for render, that means final output, okay
we will have a look in this also, and here we have the effect and pre-sets you can drag this
and you found more things, this is for preview, play forward, play backward, play per frame,
go to the last, go to the first and that all so, this is the basically, colour mode and this
is basically the audio channel so, after effect is not basically for audio editing,
it's basically for compositing but, still you have the freedom to examine your audio
but you can't edit the audio you have audition, adobe audition which is completely different software
and it's only working audio okay so, you can off any of the panel's
and we will flip horizontal let's put some over here,
what is look development?
of lighting the director’s mind
regardless, once in lighting try to separate the light setup in the passes as long as have
the light sources
it will save up a lot of time doing multiple iteration very quickly without having to re-render
the whole scene
lastly, start simple and keep it simple as long as possible
no need to overcomplicate setups, if you are able to get the desired look in simple ways
of course, it varies from production to production
however, the aiming should be on getting desirable looks in shortest amount of time
if you achieved keeping it simple, then the next department in pipeline will be really
have direct relation to each other helping to deliver the mood and emotion into the audience
grateful to you
thanks, hope you understand the same, let’s switch to the next session
if either of them changes, it affects the look of the other one
generally during this stage is sign or asset could go through many <?>alliteration</?>,
such as change in color refraction, different lighting setups, so on and so forthly
finally, it is the ones director hands to select a look among all the provided option
what is covered inside the look development?
let’s consider two main look development phases
the two d and the three d, as they complement each other, because each one is done easier in
certain ways, while serving different needs, during the two d process which take is prior
to the three d one
in the live action vfx or cg productions, there is always a need to explore potential
it is important to experiment with different color, shapes, atmosphere and placement of
lights searching for various mode, that together can help telling a story
nevertheless, one thing to keep in mind in shot continuity while doing look development
eventually, it defined how mood shift from one scene to another a single shot, or as
it could end up having multiple painted versions which is shown in the direction to the director
so, that he or she can better emphasize certain looks and then decide which way to go
the more the look development process, the more delay it can be get
let’s say from overall tools all the way to atmospheric effect such as haze, volume,
rays and et-cetera, causing a look development gradually getting developed
through this stage the details should be just enough to convey the ideas and the feeling
looks a scene or object could have to ensure the final product in both story, and aesthetics
without getting to elaborate
moving to a three d look development, it is commonly began by experimenting with asset shading
this is where the different materials for different part of the object get constructed
and evaluated, under various lighting condition
thus, having real world references is keen in achieving possibly result
it can be images or actual footage of a certain material to be able to study in more detail
finding out its characteristics- there are many brief models out there, the popular one
of those is cg effects distributes, where does a <?>3:32</?> specular deals happen on
real world metallic
material as an explanation establishes shader setting for a metal material, which is reflected
will look its best
described its physical behavior
not only required set to have a proper brain model, but also does it need to be <?>led</?>under
a decent environment to accurately get evaluated
similarly, just like two d work flow, the texture and the shader only need to have enough general
details, to illuminate the feeling
the idea is simply doing multiple illustration quick in order to explore different potentialities
now, this can get extended to lighting to complement the look development process
the previous work both on two d and three d would get sent to lighting and all according to
that the couple of exploration, and revision take place to visualize possibly mode and
emotion through lighting
look development could have different meaning in various <?>pace</?>, but it is the notion
words mentioned all this look development phase can go faster enough to have the development
process, getting circulated inside the team rapidly
when should somebody start a look development on a project?
as soon as the director shares the thought and the concept act on the look of the project
be in the film or the game or the commercial with them to be team look development department
would get together to start
brainstorming ideas how to achieve the director’s vision and be able to provide <?>5:12</?>
her with early design as soon as possible
it is essentially to find the right time with manageable team timeframes to assure every
revision and update and can get delivered in time
of how the project will look and feel like in the end
having said that during early stage it is mainly the two d team that is unity, three d model
and create and refers provide to be sent to the three d team
once provided with the three d model different shades variation gets created to be shown
to the director
likewise, the same process is valid for lighting
at first glance, it may seem like a sequentially process which is corrected for initial phases
however, by the time all pre-request are prepared such as early concept, models, shade and so
on
the whole look development would be able to have quick back and forth internally, in order
to refine output as much as possible
in fact, anything in production that rapidly interact through faces of achieving special
supposing, the director is happy with the latest progress and general look over different
shots; the material can be finalized by the <?>more</?> focus department, such as the
shading and the lighting team
each studio tends to do the different for instance one place rather final shades gets
established right with the look development, because they already considered look development
as a shading team
another studio has decided shading due which zero in on the texture, color and material
when somebody do the look development process, the first thing to keep in mind is color space
it is much product topic but to just hint it at, it is critically the colors space be
strength the whole time is change in pipeline color space in the middle of the road
look can be called look development
whether the scene referred or display referred could cause many issue, and sent incorrect
look to final product
the least thing to do is refine all the texture and shader for matter are in linear space
before fade into the render
renders calculate and such calculation never consider nonlinear inputs
to further emphasize previous points, it is necessary to provide various versions rapidly,
ensuring everything is going on the right track constantly
otherwise, you may find you yourselves speeding in a lot of time and energy creating something
that may eventually get ruled out
continuity between shots definitely need to be high importance as well, a transparent
it could range from speeding painting ideas on paper, all the way to <?>rapid</?> explanation
object might work well under certain lighting
but, the exact same material might fail to deliver the right look due to lacking certain
parameters being work on already such as glass roof all through the material are getting
tested under varying lighting condition
please sure you are consider all sort of possible lighting <?>senior 8:06 </?> are going to
be set in production
this will help you make shader more stable and accurate through the production
regarding lighting continuously factor can get plenty help from three d look development to
a large extent
because, those one have already passed direction approval and pretty much represent the type
of three d models shading which is more common known as look development and lighting
﻿hello everyone so, in this session we will do the more blocking into autodesk maya so,
already implemented into the character and all the things is being renamed quite well
so, whatever you does, you will go to the channel box to have a particular section of your view okay
so, like this way you can work quite well and also make sure that whenever you are working in
a particular scene or any data you should always use to do you can say some version saving
so, that if something went wrong you can go to the previous version
to have an update of the same so, this is the belly region of the character, move like this and
also we have some sort of translate z value, just move like this and this is the feet region
and also move here somehow here and after that you have the character proportionate which is
also been seen into the reference you can say the larger part which is at the grid is known as the
full controller of the character if you move the larger part from the
start and end key which is twenty-four frames per second and also we just have
grid definitely whole character will move from its mean position okay
like this way you can work for the same and
timeline, twelfth frame, you can have the leg region and also here the all minus twenty-two
and you can just change the value because it’s getting distorted, so like this way okay
so, right now i will just go to the toe lift and here we have just putted some values into the toe
lift which is just below the computer screen at the right side on your screen into the channel
box so, at first now i will just go to the downward region as you can see if you just move,
the foot region will remain in its own position because we have just setted the
i k and f k that’s why and you can just select this controller and just go to this stretch,
one x of height and four x according to your need so, you can change the timeline
so you can stretch it easily as you can see its just moving
into the scale value with the help of stretch you can just have the values,
you can just putted the value into the stretch you can have extra manipulation key and also you have
the heel lift so you can just easily lift up your heel into your model and also
you just have this part which is the pelvis region of the character so, you can just give the weight
because if weight will not been there it will not look realistic, so much of more realistic
so, this heel region which is the heel part so at first as you can see the heel region
have the translate value and also have the rotational value so,
you don’t require the scale value, right now we’ll just put some values into the heel lift
so, as you can see we have just putted zero right now, and just putted zero to its mean position
parameters with the help of preferences okay, so, here you have the key thick sizes and you can just
because if you just have the minus value it will go
upward because it’s going against the gravity so, minus happened only when you are just putting
the value into the gravity as you can see there is a jerk between the footsteps so,
we have to just decrease the jerk level because we have to add certain key frame so, that jerk
will never been produce and also we just have to manipulate few of the curves into the character
as selected the character which is the rotate y axis and we’ll just putted
some amount of minus value which is a shift with the character to its mean position
and rotate minus x four will be there at the rotate x and also
we have the value of z which is zero so, now the character is facing towards the front
as you can see its moving constant so we don’t require the constant motion
increase the value accordingly and also you can just have the all values which is the increase
so, what if else we have to do, we’ll just putted some of the values into the
so, right now i am just focusing on the top part so, this is the shoulder region and
this all will just by holding control and shift you can just have a particular right click paste,
you can paste your key frames into any of the particular part, you just have to just select that
part and you can just paste it accordingly okay so, right now as you can see the shoulder region and
this part especially attached with the shoulder curve, so if you manipulately rotate this section,
it will definitely just have a particular look at your just like this way okay
so, you can just manipulate the curvature of the model and also you will just move it like
this and also you will just select and just move it like this so, like this way you can manipulate
pending frames so, like this way you have this part which is activated and
the full character and also you just look at the character and if you just look at the reference,
you will find a huge amount of changes also but if you just have a video sequence that
would be much more better because if you just record yourself with a camcorder or mobile,
if you just put that video into your computer and just look at around and just
do the animation, followed by a video, so that will generate a huge amount of you can say
realistic into your animation so, like this way you just have to animate it accordingly okay
now, again it is stiff because we have to do the blocking, so we don’t require extra keys but yeah
still you can work for the same at few frames you have to do the correction, you have to work hard
for the few frames, after that you will do the cycling or the looping step okay so, that means
a few frames will be the hard method or you can say the manual method, after that you will just
key ticks and the channel box so, you can select between key ticks
put the cycle loop, which will just allow you to just animate that thing in a particular loop
so, like this way you can animate all the things inside maya software, so you have to just have
the reference, you can have the idea if you are immature or if you are a beginner then definitely
you need some references because if you just look at the reference, and animate the character
accordingly then it will be much more better so, if you are professional, you can use your own
idea that which part is moving and which part will not move, which part will go against gravity or
with the gravity, so like this way, if you are a professional definitely you can do it by yourself,
otherwise you can take the reference or you can just record yourself for
animation purpose and it would be much more better that you can record yourself
and have the animation on your computer so, here we have the ball lift and here we
channel box and activated and here you have the key text sizes so, you can increase the
have the translate so, i'm just putting seventy-five into the translate, hundred
would be fine and i think one twenty-five would be better and after that we’ll just,
as you can see there is a mistaken, so we’ll just move this controller and also this controller
so, now you can find that the mistake has been gone because that thing is getting distress, so
if you just move this thing the mistaken will be gone so, now i just select the
whole character and just move it somehow here and copy the thing and just paste the
remaining key frame into the last one and after that if you just switch
definitely you will get a huge animation because the character is following the loop and if you
paste any key definitely the character will behave as your key, whichever you have just pasted
so, now here we have the translate which i will just put it hundred
sizes or decrease the sizes, so i just put it to and here you have playback playback would be
no, not needed, i think translate z would be minus hundred so, the rest position will start from
here and also we’ll just go to the graph editor, so graph editor is very important as we have also
discussed in the bouncing ball that graph editor and dope sheet is very important,
it has all sort of curves which is situated at the top as you can see these are the tangent,
these are the tangent, which have some amount of curvature in it that will allow you to
work in a detailed animation view so, graph editor is very important and also it has
point that will allow you to just give the curve to its key frames between key frames you can add
extra key frames in the graph editor also okay if you are not using the timeline, definitely you can
use the graph editor to add some more key frames, okay like this way you can work for the same
as the character is moving forward and i just open the graph editor, here the line is linear
continuous, no problem and after that you have the oscillation and once, so there would
and it has two key frames between you can add or you can also manipulate through tangent
changes so, as you can see the character is moving in one second which is the twenty-four
frames per second, which is in pal so, right click and just click on the slant tangent,
it is moving in a robotic way as you can see okay the character which is not forming the any wave
kind of motion which is robotic motion and after that if you just do the curve into your tangents,
definitely it will form some amount of naturality so, we’ll look the graph editor in a detail way,
so at first we have to check the animation, as you can see we have in between frame,
which the two are the blocking and this is the you can say refinement okay
so, refinement is very important in between frames you have to just put some amount of frame, so that
the blocking or the robotic motion will be gone and you will have a detailed animation
be a real time, so i just using twenty-four frames per second which is the real time
as you can see we have the character and after that we’ll just start the blocking process
you can say animation view okay, with the help of this you can change your character animation
so, here we have the undo and undo infinite okay fine, and these all are the panels which came
across in the preferences so, you have to look at one by one into each and every panel, so whatever
you want to change you can change from here, it will directly updated on your view port okay so,
rest are fine i think display animation is okay i will hit on save so the part has been saved
so, right now we have the setting inside the timeline and also you have the character,
so here you have the new shelf and i will just do the enter new shelf name,
so i just put it the name of the character mary and after that we’ll just do one more thing is
that we start working on the tweaking process so, just select this part and here we have
we have the all selected thing which is been added inside the self menu of our
inside maya software so, right now we will just do the blocking inside maya software and
scene so, each and every panel have its own <?>important</?> value so, right now what i
will do, i will just go to the character setup, as you can see it’s moving forward it has the
dark region which is the left leg you can say and now we’ll just follow this animation
as you need the reference if you are working in the animation inside maya you definitely need
the reference, so here would be the top view and here would be the front view and here would be
the left view so, reference management is very important, you should need at least references,
okayay so that nothing would be getting problem, so you may have a good and refine animation
with the help of the references so, we’ll select both the shoulder region
and you can rotate it accordingly, as you can see each and every controller is being defined
with the polygons quite well okay so, as you can see just drag this into the downward region and
we will just manipulate each and every part one by one so, right now what i will do,
after that we’ll select the feet region and here i'm just move it little bit at the back region, so
right now i'm just starting the blocking process as in the right hand side in the channel box you
will found the transparency which is minus, i'm just putting minus twenty-five, okay fine
so, this part, this region which is the left leg, so just put it the translate z value
so, inside the perspective viewport, so i will just rotate the step
and after that we’ll just select this part and just see that it is working quite well or not,
yeah definitely it will work and as you can see the left, right leg
and we’ll just have the channel box where you can have all the things which is renamed properly, so
renaming is very important and you have to look at the reference one by one
i have the timeline which is set to one twenty, i will just decrease the value to twenty-four,
so that whatever you will make, you will have a good and refined animation into your reference okay
with the help of reference, you can achieve a proper and good result that is much more
beneficial to work with the reference so, as you can see this leg is moving at
the front area and we have the ball lift and after that if you just go to stretch and you
can just put the value of stretch and you can just put it some amount of stretch value, so that
it will just stretch your whole animation process and also all things is renamed
properly that means we’ll not get any confuse so, renaming is very important in your animation
so, if you are renaming, well you can have a good animation, so you will not get confuse so,
whenever you are saving a file or doing something, you should have a proper rename
of your animation so, with the help of this, you can have a toe lift and also you have the
so i will need only one, one second so, right now it is in pal and if you are
values, you can just manipulate it okay so, you have the heel lift, you can easily
lift the heel like this way and also by middle mouse button you can drag the values,
so, you may have the idea, how you are just putting all the values into your character okay so,
after that when the blocking process will be over, we will start working on the graph editor which is
very detailed and we’ll discuss this graph editor laterwards it have some sort of curvature,
tangent and points you can easily manipulate all the things inside the graph editor
so, with the help of like this way you can just put it your animation in a very good manner
every controller had to be animated because this is the character and if a character is moving,
each and every controller has its own <?>importancy</?>, so with the help of
working ntfs definitely it will go to thirty, thirty frame per second so, this is your timeline and you can
select all these fingers and just move it like this and select this one moving like this
and select this, this region move it like this, this and this one okay
with the help of this one you can have a proper flow of your animation
and this finger would be like this because this is an organic character and each and
every step has to be animated quite well so, you have to just animate it accordingly
and after that when the animation gets over, you have to just do the play blast which is a
dummy render or you can say the rough render, so we will discuss this play blast in laterwards,
okay like this way you can just manipulate all the things inside your maya software
and as you can see the hand region is rotating quite well and also we’ll just select all the
just run across your timeline and you can just decrease the value or increase the value according
things like having animation like rotating along its axis and
also we’ll just select this part and just move it like this and just rotate it
and also we’ll just select this part, move it like here, select this part move it like here, and
the proper flow of animation can be seen into a reference, if you are working into a reference,
you can have a better look at how you are just manipulating all the things inside your software
so, with the help of this thing i can just move quite well, okay little bit of more space to have a
clear look and also we'll just select this part and just move it forward and also just do the
contrast region and here just move it like this okay
so, these things should be bend and also these things should be rotate
and after that we'll select this finger and just move like here and also we'll just the
to your need i just opened the auto key, so that each of every key will be automatically
torso region which is the shoulder part, we’ll somehow here so, the proper rotation is very
important into the character, that means if you are working into the character walk cycle,
you have to just work in the particular character each and every part okay one by one
so, moving like this and also just select and just rotate like this way and also the palm region
shoulder and just move backward, just select this particular shoulder panel and one by one you just
have to just move like this okay so, the proper movement of a particular character according to
the timeline is very important, you can just move it like this way and also you just follow the shoe
region which you have manipulated so, that means the character have all
the data which into the curve, that means you have the curve data which
generated and here you have the preferences so, now the time slider which is the animation
﻿hello everyone so, welcome to this course of animation so, as you can see we have done the
for a while and also this one so, as you can see now we can change the part of this hand
into the rotate y, so at first we’ll just off the translate values into slant so, we don’t
require curvature into the translate value, but in rotate y can have the manipulation of points
so, select and rotate y and just select and just move it like, like this,
so that it will form a particular curve loop select this and move it somehow here and also
select this and move it somehow here so, as you can see it is forming a particular loop into your
graph editor, and also just move it somehow here so, little bit of shipment is very important,
that means you don’t have to shift like this, just look at your animation into the timeline, just
proper flow to the timeline and also check out each and every part is moving quite well or not
then after you need something to do into the graph editor, you can shift the points accordingly okay
working into the walk cycle or any of the character animation, you need the curviness
so, with the help of this, you may have the idea how you can just change into the graph editor,
and how you can just manipulate it each and every process into the graph editor
put it like here and also will just select this hand, select this part and move it here
select this one, move it at the downward region, and also this part need to be
rotate y, i think rotate z would be fine and this part which is the rotate x, and
the head region of the character,
the neck region,
click all the curvature, and minus fifteen so, it’s just gone down as you can see a
that means if you add the curviness, it will produce some amount of more realistic
this way is important, and also we just working in the rotate value as compared to the translate
one so, we are working more into the rotate values because whenever any character is moving,
the rotation value will have to be changed well okay so, this way you can have the proper idea that
how your character is moving well, and also how you can change the rotate value inside
the character so,
the shipment of the graph editor and followed by the timeline, whatever you does into the timeline,
it will all show into the graph editor that means in graph editor you will have the detailed
view of your timeline so, i am in playblast option, you can just have the custom display,
and i think size would be reduce, because playblast is only for having your rough view
amount so, six forty, three twenty is fine, scale is one and frame padding would be four okay so,
so, better you should have a reference and after that if you watch to the reference, just copy that
where you want to save your playblast file, you have to just define your correct directory
so, i will just select any of them and make sure that whenever you are working in any of the file,
you should always have to rename accordingly so, that if you have the proper rename, you can go to
your file easily, okay so rename is very important and also whenever you want to save your file,
please make sure that all file will save in a particular folder of that particular
scene, which you are creating into the maya so, you don’t have to put in each and every drive,
you have to save in only one folder so, that whenever you are working, you just
call that particular drive so, as you can see we have
yeah we have just opened the playblast window, which is floating window, and also when your
same animation, you will just get little bit of more realistic so, there should be a weight on
will minimize the same and will go to the perspective each and every time i am working
more in perspective, because in perspective you can easily change your screen, or you can rotate
and you can watch every every you can say every angles so, instead of having in all the view,
you can also work in the perspective if you need, but, you have to check in every view okay
so, checking in every way especially in front and the left view is very important
after that you can work manipulate your animation into the perspective, and again
you have to look at your perspective sorry you have to look at your left and front view okay so,
changing of your view is very important, you don’t have to fix in only one view if you
want to work in left view, if you have worked in left view, definitely in front view or perspective
view things will not been matched so, each and every time you have to switch on your view okay
the feet, so that when character is moving forward and it’s just tapping to the ground,
so, whatever you have done in front view, you have to look at in the left view,
and after that you have to manipulate all the things into the perspective because in
perspective view, you may have the camera, you can easily rotate the camera around the
model so, as you can see graph editor we have opened the graph editor and just selected all
the panels of this particular character, as you can see its gets messed so, like this way artist
gets confused because if you open all the things, you can’t work so, instead of having opening all
those, you can have only one thing at a time so, as you can see i am just does the post
infinity, so that the cycle will happen, each and every time your thing will be into animation
so, post infinity, linear or you can use this cycle, so like this way you can work
so, that your animation will follow one by one, one by one in each and every frame by itself, you have to
some amount of weight can be seen okay so, that means we have to manipulate the
just make sure that you just putted the frames into the first few numbers of the timeline so,
just put the keys into the first few frames and after that it will just have a cycle, cycle loop
so, as you can see the red line
inside the graph editor is showing that we are currently in that particular frame
so, you can just move it here and change the particular point,
like this way you can have a proper flow of your animation and also by simple tweaking
of something you can have to achieve a good result inside maya software so,
make sure that whenever you are working, don’t have to focus in one part, you just have to
focus from head to toe to legs to feet and each and every part you have to manipulate it okay
so, that would be much more better and it will also form some amount of realistic animation
points through the tangent, or we have to add or maybe we have to delete the point if you just add
as compared to the normal animation so, having reference is also very important,
you can shoot yourself inside a room or in the garden with a camera, or with phone
after that you can just import that video into your computer and just look at each and every
frame and you can just work in maya to copy your animation, that would be much more realistic okay
so, having reference is very important especially especially in animation,
you can also have reference in modeling if you don’t have how can you make,
but you can also sketch things in modeling and after that you can use in maya and just
model the same thing, but you have to sketch but, in animation you can’t use your imagination,
because if you use your imagination, definitely the animation will not be in superb as compared
to the realistic one so, if you are experienced then it would be okay, but if you are a fresher or
extra points definitely some amount of jerk will came so, whenever you are adding onto your model,
newcomer definitely you need some reference okay so, having reference you can easily easily
manipulate your character or change your character, okay so that is very important
like this way you can just work on the timeline, move to the perspective to
just have a particular look of your character, that it is working quite well or not okay,
i think rest is fine, so just putted some value into the channel box, so that
you may have the idea how you can just manipulate the things like here and to lift
little bit of liftment into the toe, so we have just putted few numbers
going to translate z and you just move it like here okay and
between these two points here also, we just need to just lift the toe
and also the heel region of the character so, will just move it somehow here, and as you can
the points into the timeline or the key, you have to think about that if you need maximum point,
see the z value which we have just move it, and having the particular weight into the character
okay so, like this way you can have weight with the help of graph editor, and weight into the
character is very important if you put weight definitely your animation will look some much
of more realistic so, in next session we will have a detailed view of our animation okay
you have to just undergo through a very very amount of corrections also
block process, and now in this session we will do some amount of tweaking inside the
because if you need maximum points, definitely jerk will came, so minimum points you can adjust
through tangents, because all the tangents has been given so, as you can see we are in channel
box and just delete it and the manipulated, the translate z value, which is minus ninety and
we moving frame by frame, so that you may have the idea about how you can put it in each of the
frame so, in character or in any organic especially we don’t require this scale in maximum
cases yeah you can use this scale value, but translate and rotation is quite fine for me
and now i am using the translate and rotation, because we don't require this scale here
and again and again you have to switch it to the graph editor,
so that you may have a proper look of the point flowing into your graph editor so, as you can see
we have all the values which is situated here and also we have the translate y value, which is
maya software so, as you can see we have the timeline and also we have the panel
now i am manipulating into the graph editor so, moving forward and selecting this one,
moving upward just select the tangent and just take the curve, and after that translate z will
be happen and as you can see the graph is going from downward to upward region
is that, when you are just working in the tangent x, translate x, the curve value will form okay
so, like this way you can work quite well and also you have this region, which is
here, and also move forward and just go to in between the key frames and
just select this part and go to rotate z and just have the manipulation, select this one, and just
make a curve which is the slant curve and also this part need to be little bit of like this way,
like ease out so, here we have extra points which we have just putted the key frame
which is situated at the channel box so, we just select any of the file and just put it the value,
so, right now i will just leave this and will just go to translate x only
because if you just open all the values which is x, y, z, rotation x, y, z you will get the
confused so, you will open one at a time that would be much more you can say beneficial for you
if you open all the things, you will get confused, so rather than having all the things to be open,
should go for having only one at a time okay so, as you can see we are forming the curve
which is generated inside the graph editor, and also we will play around the timeline because,
whenever you are working in animation, you have to keep on playing your timeline,
so that you may have the proper idea, how your character animation is growing okay
so, as you can see we just putted the two point which is at the top and
moving little bit of higher value and i think we should move this part at first, then i will just
which is the right side corner of your screen so, as you can see if you play frame by frame
go to the zero part, which is the first frame and move it so, i just putted one value move upward,
so that we have the proper flow of the particular curvature, and also will just move now here
so, reason behind moving to different because at first we have to focus at the mid frame,
then after that we have to focus on the first one so, like this way you can just move point
one by one, or you can easily move points you can have the group of points, select all
the points in a single way, and just move it up because you have to just make sure that you to
do the animation proper in the few frames after that you will do the cycling which is the looping
inside maya, and after that each and every step, the animation will be
duplicated and again and again the character will move or walk in the same way okay so,
that would be much more better, so that you may have the idea about how your animation is flowing
which is the shoulder recheck and rotate y and here we have the curvature,
select this curvature, delete the points, which we don’t required
and also we just move it here and also just select this and just move it down little bit,
select this one and just move it somehow here, select all the points and now we have a slate
which is this one, this too and this part specially this one, which is the twelfth
frame as you can see on the graph editor timeline and here we are in fifteenth frame so
we have to just switch to the frame by frame that means in twelfth frame we have this point,
at your timeline that would be much more fine and as you can see we have select this part and
and in fifteenth frame we have the another one so, i will put the curvature which is following
the twelfth frame and just easing out into the fifteenth frame so, that’s matter easing in and
easing out, if you know the process of ease in and ease out will have a good animation,
as you can see here we have the same process from zero frame the animation is going upward and from
fifteen it’s going the downward so, like this way you can have a proper loop of your animation,
so now i am focusing on the feet region so, as you can see we have this frame which is
the sixth one, translate z at the value we will just move it little bit of forward and
also we just move it little bit like this and also just select the tangent and just move it
happens next we just have the loop which is following the character in a straight way,
will just go to the graph editor, because whatever we will do, we will just have to
and after that will just select the hand region,
and will just move it so, as you can have the idea that each and every controller has
its own key feature, which we have added in the previous session so, if you need any correction,
you just select that controller and put it into the timeline, and just work for the same
so, the animation which you are doing into the character, you need to work on the controller
well so, like this way you can have the x, y and z axis and just putting the slant curvature
into your graph editor, and also this one the shoulder part so, as we have used the
shoulder pattern also we have animated the full character so, one by one you have to just select
the particular curve and do the animation, or you can <?>define</?> the same so, whenever you are
working in any inorganic or organic especially in organic, you can say living thing
manipulate inside the graph editor so, will just put this point so much of little bit of
so, you have to move each and every part from its mean position, okay that means if you don’t move,
then it will just form so much amount of robotic animation so, if you need natural animation,
you have to just select any of the curve and move accordingly, so, each and every part have
to be moved okay if you go forward, then each and every part have its own slant curvature
as you can see this shoulder need to be worked quite well, and also just select
this and manually and just change the position and the graph editor that point has gone upward,
select this part, and also we have to do the little bit of slant
select this hand region and after that what happens next? will go to rotate z,
lower, as we need some amount of curviness into the animation as whenever you are
hello everyone, so welcome to this course
so, that motion of the hand and also we will rotate it and also<?>8:34</?> few of the points
so will decrease the crease value by moving it into the downward region
and after that will select the hand, go to the rotate y and just select this point
and which is the forward point which will help you to start, okay, so, will down the point
as you can see whatever, we are doing, it also updating in the side one, because we
have just increased the loop area
you have to just make sure that you have to work hard at the first few frames, after that
you will have continuity
the legs are moving quite well with the help of timeline, you can just drag down at the
because whatever you will do in the first frame, it will generate the loop, so, make
sure that wherever you are working, we will work properly
in the first few frames <?>9:40</?> use the loop, so that it will follow the loop and
the animation
as moving along the timeline we are in front, also we have to just manipulate the hit region
so, that the flowing of the character would be natural, some much more natural, so each
and every step we have to follow according to the difference
and make sure that whenever you are working you put the s button on or the auto key on,
so that you will don’t have to put s button at the time of just putting the keyframes
just put the auto key on, so that whenever you are changing, it will automatic update
reasonable speed
the key on your timeline
so, the retardation of point here, as you can see in the graph editor, it is performing
<?>reveals long art</?>
and also follow along the timeline up and down motion of the a particular section, and
will just off this
and <?>11:59</?> that what we will do?
select this part, forward and just go to bounding box
we will have the <?>12:08</?>
if you are working in the bounding box, definitely the scene will be so happy and you work quite well
so, renaming is very important, if you are working in maya, you have to make versions
after that, when you are satisfied with your work, just make sure that you will work on
so, that whatever happened in the current version, you can go to the previous version,
so your file will never been corrupted
so, as you can see, we are in bounding box, also we have using the character, which is
in the perspective <?>12:36</?>
so, as you can see here, we have nurbs and curves we will off for a while, <?>retest</?>
animation and after that will go to the few of the panels we have to manipulated
at first what we will do?
let’s have a look we are in perspective and all the view has been on
so, let’s on this nurbs and curves, so that we will have a proper view of all the curves,
the plain <?>grass</?>
which <?>13:18</?>
all the things has been getting into in and all, so that whenever you are working, you
will get all the things <?>13:26</?>
if you can just select that part, you can easily manipulate the same process
so, renaming is very important, you don’t have to find it along in your channel box, sorry
<?>13:40</?> and use the property name, function inside the maya application
so, whenever you are saving any file or manipulating any of the file or forming any file inside
maya, or any other three d or two d software
you have to give proper rename, so that whenever you call the file, you just put that name,
and after that your file will came
as we have focused on this part, the foot is moving quite well, we have the controller
so, renaming is very important as whenever you are working in your file
so, this point will be manipulated at the top, as you can see, the proportion of the
character is getting changed, according to the shifting of the points
maximum time we are using the perspective because perspective, if you rotate the same,
all the views which is in the loop, in the perspective form
so, maximum time we are using the perspective, and after that you can also go to any of the
view, to have a proper check up at the section
be down little bit
and we are moving at here, and this section would also been down
which will attach at the feet region
i think, this part would be fine, so proper shipment of the points is very important,
which is shifting the points in a very well order
like this you have to animate one one in each each every point, which is forming along the part
so, this point would be in the down region and this point at this both of <?>been</?>
is slantly, so that the animation which is formed would be yeah, the fine and smooth
the curves, which in the rigging section have been formed
this part would be down little bit and this part will also be <?>16:56</?> here to have
so, we will have extra freedom, so that we can move our feet quite well in a single order
a curvature look at our animation
and <?>17:02</?> that it will just, i think we have to manipulate this section also, because
if this would be slant little bit of curviness will form along the shoulders of the character
<?>17:33</?> proportion and the shoulder
as you can see here
as after block you have just to put some amount of points in between them, because if blocking
have playblast, play speed which is in quick time
or you can also use the real time, so right now i am using time for a while
as you can see, so, we will just manipulate this part only
and after that i have changed the playback speed from the timeline, and after that i
am focusing on the toe region of the character
and select x, i think we have to manipulate, as you can see it forming the cycle because
so, these are the leg region and we have to just follow, because as you can see the l
box each and every step has been in quite well
and you can put the value, if you are clean you have the side, you have toe left and all
so, whenever you are working in the action step, you have to follow the process, which
is very important
because, if you have the rename process well, you can animate your character quite well,
at the first we will rotate the same because we need some much more details into the feet
because you don’t have to confuse
because, all the thing has been renamed quite well, you just have to put the value of <?>lead</?>
in the channel box and attribute editor, which is very important
so, renaming is very important, if you are working on the particular complicated character,
which has all the parts, which has different parts, and also you can just manipulate the
graph editor
whenever you are manipulating any point in the graph editor, it will <?>20:18</?> some
amount of curve, and also <?>rename</?> the graph editor
it will show all the names of the parts
so, you will not get any confused, whenever you are working in complicated character like this
region
so, in this course we will learn about refinement process of our <?>0:10</?> and the animation
as you can see, the animation process is leaning quite well, it has some amount of freeness
and also it has some amount of weight on the ground, so you can add extra points like
so, i am in playblast option and will close for a while, because <?>20:54</?> right now
and go to render settings
and here we have <?>presets</?>, so right now i will use the low preset, which would
be hd ten eighty p this would be full hd, you can also go for four k and all
so, right now i am just using this one, and at point<?>21:12</?> or you can use the photo
version, which is also jpeg <?>21:18</?> okay
setting, scale, frame padding would <?>21:23</?> and rename process is again very important,
where you are saving your file in directory
so, that it will move quite well and after that when just move it in this controller
now, the render process will have happen, at first it will buffer the same, and after
that it will produce some amount of rendering step
whenever you are working, bone will connect to the controller, so that you will have a
extra freedom that means you can just work on controller and get all the things like
a natural animation, so, you need some references also
if you watching the reference, you can just animate it quite well, it’s moving quite
well in the timeline
and if you play forward and backward, we can see animation is working quite well, because
we have added extra key frames to refine the process
at first you have just go to the blocking step and after that you will have to manipulately
put some amount of points into your reference, so i am manipulating the shape, and also we’ll
process of the upper body part
just editing the particular parts
we have done, the looping step in the graph editor and it following the same speed
because we have started the first frame and the first few frames inhibited the same in
all the axes like x, y and z, in all the translation like translate, rotate and scaling values
so, after that when you are satisfied you can loop the same, which will just cycling
the process
so, one more i have to say that we have used this translate and rotate, so scale is not
been possible for this
if you need extra details you can just put this scale, but in inorganic like <?>bouncing</?>
so, with the help of this, you can have a look that we have just edited the model with
ball and all, you have to work with the scaling process also
as you can see, we are deleting the junk keyframe, so that if you add very high amount of keyframes,
then it will produce some amount of jerkiness on your animation
so, make sure that whenever you are working, you will just put as much as a keyframe as
per your need
so, don’t go excessive or don’t put little bit of, because if you put little bit, it
will just produce some mechanical animation
but if you produce or just <?>3:45</?> huge amount of keyframes, it will definitely create
some amount of jerk on your animation
so, make sure that whenever you are working, you just put the keyframes according to your
a particular graph editor, and after that we have all the points, which is situated
need
so, as you can see, we are moving along the timeline and also we are manipulating some
amount of points as per our need
so, will select the top part and just move forward, we are looking at the particular section
this one would be fine and if i go here or in between them, select this one and move
it downward
so, that whenever you are working, you will have a proper look, that means open the graph
editor at the top screen
and after that you just manipulate all the things one by one, and will just select this
part
at the graph editor
and i think we should move it over here and select this one, should move it over here
somehow here
if you are working in perspective, then you have to go to the top or the front or the
left one
so, that means you have all the view and after that you have a proper look
that whatever you are forming, you will form in a correct way
whenever a character is move, all the body parts will move
so, you have to play with the head, the shoulder, the legs, the hand and also with the fingers,
if you need a proper and a realistic animation
so, with the help of a single you can say manipulation process, you can add extra things
that means with the help of a reference, you can have a clear look, that which part is
moving when a character is moving
and always use this loop up and down, as you can see, this loop is up and down, that it
will form a curviness into animation, which look so much more realistic, as you can see
now, we will put some amount of <?>point</?> specific area, so that the animation will
look some much more realistic as compared to this one
so, we are working in the playblast, at first the playblast will buffer, and after that
a small window will form
you can enlarge it by dragging or use the maximize button, so you can see the playblast
is a dummy of your <?>6:25</?> all the frames at first for the same then it will produce
like if you go to each attribute editor, you have all the panels
a frame you can say the video file, so, this is only for examine purpose
if you are satisfied with a playblast, then you can have a render and all
so, manipulation of points is very important, i am forming some amount of curve in <?>6:45</?>
section
and also will just look at ground by moving forward into the timeline, that means you
have to do again and again to have a clear and better look for the animation
so, the rotation y as you can see, all the values are changed, if you have three axis
which is x, y and z, obviously we are working in three d
so, the x would be red, y would be green and z would be, so that you will not get any confusion,
in channel box also which is the right side on your screen, you can just add all the points
when you are working on the graph editor
so, this step will also followed in the <?>7:35</?>, if you have <?>dope sheet</?> which is opened
and all the points will have different colours, so animation is very important we are just
working in the animation
you know about the graph editor which is <?>7:50</?> point, because if you can work in graph editor
well, animation will be so much more smooth and realistic
so, by working in the graph editor, you will have a proper idea and also you have to know
moving along the timeline and <?>see</?> the hand region is it flowing quite well, because
we have to just go to the <?>8:23</?> and move it here some
one by one at a particular section
hello everyone and welcome to this course of three d animation
and after that will open the nurbs and curves also, and will off the grid
because we don't require grid anymore and we’ll go to
so, that the character will move at the ground, and after that will just put it on here somehow
here, and will off the grid because without having grid we can’t apply the ground, because
grid is required for it
and after that you will go to the first frame, so that will check the animation working quite well
one more thing we have to define that whenever the character is walking, the foot region
will not go inside the ground
so, you have to take care of it, you have to go playblast
and after that run into the timeline one by one, so that it will form a good playblast
and after that when it happened, you can check your animation on the playblast, that it is
working quite well or not
so, playblast has been completed and a new window will pop-up which shows the animation
and as you can see, the animation is working well because the foot region of the character
is not going inside the ground, which is not overlapping
so, that would be fine because we have to take care that the foot region or any of the
character part will not overlap to its <?></?> so, we have to fix all the things
like this way you have to define a particular frame that you have the idea, that how character
is move into the frame
are working quite well
and how it’s such generating some weight around its motion, which look so much of more natural
so, when you are working in animation, you have unique some references, so that you will
look at the reference and just work on the same
which is very beneficial, you have the reference that would be okay
i will just go to and we have the bookmark and we go to the edit bookmark, so that we
have defined camera
that means if you have the defined camera, you can use the camera, otherwise if you don’t
want to use the camera, you can use bookmark
so, that the scene particular section of your scene will just form, and then have the apply
and apply to shelf
also the body part which is also quite well, and after that will just place this and also
after that it will form on your shelf, so whenever you change your camera angle, you
can go to that edit bookmark
this particular section, so as you can see, we are now goes again as to form all curves
we have into
and after that select any of them, and go to the graph editor and change the character
animation and decrease the points and after that we’ll just edit the tangent one by
rotate this according to our need, quite well into the timeline which is very important
and after that if the plane is being done we will generate the group and will just select
this part and will go to translate x
will put at in this view, which is the left view and will go to main graph
and we’ll just select this graph, we’ll just lower the value like this way
one by one will just decrease the tangent and we have to generate the curve, tangent,
cover graph, graph sheet editor
and will <?></?> timeline to have a look at the <?></?> it’s working quite well
and after that go to the playblast to have a playblast, that means again and again you
have to just open the playblast
and the buffer will form, so that you will have the idea about having playblast on the
on your screen
and after that will just work for the same, because whatever you does it will all show
in the playblast
that is a dummy animation viewport, so as you can see, this is working quite well, and
and after that just go to rotate y and select all the points, will click the same generate
the curve
and we’ll lower the curve value and will select this and will manipulate, and which
is this fine
and also we’ll select all the points which is it, so will just increase this value one
by one and with this rotate z
and will go to this section of file, and will move in this view
and as you can see we have all the points which is forming the same, delete the points
let’s say if you take any of the point the portion and the animation of the character
will change
now, you can see it is running quite well into the timeline, and also you can add extra points
if you need to add some much more details on your character, that would be okay
so, one by one you have to correct it and also you have to check it, is it working quite
well or not, okay
so, this point you need to be shifted so much more at the top and if you go forward
as you can see here, so here we have foot region of character which is working but cannot
check, but change it according to the unique animation
and as you can see we are in left view and we just check the playblast and after that
because if you have the reference, you can watch the reference quite well, and after
that you change it according to the reference
so, as you can see, the foot region of character is working well and we’ll select any of
the other parts, which you can manipulate it easily
you select any of the other parts, which you can manipulate easily
last playblast whatever you does, it will buffer the same
and it will put a new playblast on your screen
so that you may have the idea, how you have done the animation on your computer, now,
look at the playblast and just check the animation is working quite well or not
it’s working quite well
yes, it is working quite well, all the body part is moving well in a proportion way
and now you have idea how you can manipulate the animation of the character, and how you
can change
so, as you have the idea, you can work the graph sheet and dope sheet editor and all
at first save the file, hope you understand the same and let’s switch to the next session
because the character is moving quite well and just cut it and in this section which
is the perspective one
so, in this session we will define, so we will use the graph editor in this session
where, all the controllers which is into the character and we have just played around the
<?></?> and after that have the graph editor, which has some <?></?> and mesh, and will
animate all the translate
so, at first will mute all, so that we will have a normal and proper animation, will just
take and manipulate it, which work quite well
as we are running over the timeline and as you can see that select the character, and
just go to the graph editor
this point which will have to be animated, it’s following the loop, so we have generated
the loops
you have to manipulate the first section, after that you can manipulate it according
so, you can see i just drag over the timeline and also we will add some amount of points
to your need
so, we have pre infinity and post infinity, so we’ll just put the post infinity and
bring it
and as you can see the animation will generate its cycling and in manner if it does go forward,
it will just repeat the same
so, you have to add it and after that it will do that particular frame, at your timeline
so, the points which is generating in the graph editor, which is the animation key,
so you can change it through the dope, dope sheet editor also or the graph editor also
okay
so, with the help of this you will have a simple animation and you can drag it around
into our scene
the timeline
but, just minimize for a while and will just off the nurbs, so that you can have a good idea
how you can have the animation and go to the playblast, so that find your area, where you
want to move the file or where you want to generate the cache memory
so, that you will animate and you will have the idea
at first the playblast will buffer to a few frames and after that when it gets buffer,
the animation will run smoothly
so, you will have a pop-up window, which will open on your screen
as you can see, the animation has been completed and a new window is formed, which is just
open on your scene
so, at first i will put the playblast and check if the playblast is working quite well or not
and after that it’s just, with the help of this, you will have the idea that how much
animation have done on your scene
so, we’ll just look quite well because walking is important, after that walking we will have
to generate the animation between the keyframe
so, that your animation will look more refined and defined, and after that you will have
to add some more points on your animation
so, that it will look more realistic, so as you can see, you have to play frame by frame,
so that you will have the good idea about having animation, which is just on your computer
so, as you can see
so, frame by frame you just have to add the playblast, and this window as you can see,
with the help of this nurbs, you can easily manipulate your character, which we have discussed earlier
and we just selected only one point, that’s why the graph editor is showing that particular curve
which is in x axis, because x <?></?> one, so just select and just go to the right section
of your screen
you will find that controller
so, you can move it according to your need
and in this name we need a little bit of correction and this frame also
if these manipulate the curve, definitely the animation section will change and the
character section will also change
after that select one by one point, you can have the easily manipulation and as you can
the window has been pop-up
see the graph generating quite well
will change the same
because, we don’t require this and we’ll put the value on that, if you add extra points,
definitely jerk will gain
so, right now as you can see i have just recall this point and i need this, this two one point
to be deleted, and this lowering value
so, that you have to check it one by one that they whatever you have done, it is right or not
and after that i will just manipulate this point also, because we don’t require this
and also it has the playblast feature and the character is been quite well
point and after that if you just run the timeline on your screen, definitely it will show some
changes on your viewport
we are in x, y and after that we have the three axes x, y and z, so three are just forming
into different colour, here the axes
and all the curves are slant because definitely we have done the axes like this, and you can
see value from upper panel section
<?></?> and after that you can put value
okay, and after that select this point, so it will delete the same, because we don’t
require that amount of
like this way you can check the reference work, because taking this value and also to
so, with the help of the render tool, you have understanding of how you can change,
manipulate curves and all, which you have formed into the animation
so, we have three at the timeline, in that it working quite well or not
okay
one by one the plane into the timeline and also the curve just go to the all the curves
will change, because it is forming the cycle, loop on the screen
and after that if you just say see the animation, it is working quite well, like this way you
can put some points and also you can change the curve on your
and after that you just check on playblast just whatever you have done into the screen,
you just follow the right manner or not
is it working quite well?
or how the animation you have done in maya software
﻿hello everyone so welcome to this session of maya two thousand eighteen so in this session
this epi curve you could just select the hair go to the channel box and make a new layer
right click and add selected objects,ok no problem click over here so that it will not select your
hairs it will just produce reference, this is for reference, ok this is
n hair and the bottom one is the, your lines which you have formed so i will just select this line,
see a dramatic change will there we just select this, if you move definitely your hair follicles
will move as you can see whatever you will do your hair follicles will move so that’s a plus
point for there, you can easily adjust this that means you have to just keep on playing
with all the things like settings and all, after that you can do whatever you want to do whatever
style you wanna achieve you can do for the same, ok, that means you have to just keep on exploring,
you can change the color, you can change the style and all ok, you can also work, at first you can
work in fur after that you can implement the hair so like this process you can work for the same
make sure that whenever you are working we have discuss many time that you have to
work on versions so it’s very important to work on versions whatever you have done,
if you something gets missed you can go to the previous version for the correction and all ok,
like this way you can work for the same whatever style we want if you don’t want to this amount of
you can say the curliness you can change it from there and you can also have a render
you just click over here make sure that you render using will be maya software because
we are not using any of the arnold, arnold’s you can say textures and all, shaders and all,
arnold light and all, so don’t require this, only maya software is fine just have a look
as you can see the hair follicles are quite large you can just decrease the value it’s not
see we have to center pivot so because the pivot is forming at the downward region so i will go to
selecting because we are in reference mode, just click over here go to the attribute editor
and now you have the n hair and all the things which come across for the hair system so you
change the bend follicles and clump width like this way you can just work for the same there are
many more things like you can increase the sub segments height and all which is very important
or also you can play with some of the as you can see the segments are in low quality and that’s why
hair per clumps if you need to decrease you can decrease,
if you need to increase definitely you can if you don’t want to display so much of hair
into your view port, you can just decrease the value or so now here we have the clump width scale
you can decrease the values or increase according to your need if you go down,
you find all the things like collisions and all, so as you can see we have the color and all if
modify and here we have the center pivot so now the pivot has been centered aligned and after that
you go to dynamic property you will get all the things like if you want to change some of the
properties of the hair you can do it well you can as i wanna show one more thing
i just selecting this and going to the channel box and i think we’ll just hide this for a while
d you can change the pivot easily control d and just rotate the same
shift d to have multiple copies select all this and right click add selected you can also
just work like this if you go to you can play with different styles and all, definitely it will work
we’ll go to the left view and else what happens we will just select this pencil action tool and just
as you can see if you select this and just go to channel box, make a new layer
right click add selected, reference this so that it will not select by mistaken
and select any of the spline or multiple spline by holding shift and right click and go
to control vertex you can control the vertex definitely your hair will change as you can see
so you can play with clump and you can play with the style of the hair and all
it depends on you, you can also change the color,ok so when you are working in hair,
if you working in any animal if you need to generate the fur
that time whatever you are focusing just open only in that particular part, don’t have to open
the all the parts of the body because sometimes your pc may get
hang up because each and every hair has its own poly and it’s all been calculated inside your
if you press b and drag your left mouse button if you just press b and drag left mouse button,
pc so make sure that whenever you are working you just focus on that particular part, ok
so right now i am deleting this this hair because we don’t require this right click
so in hair, hair system shape you will get all the details panel whatever you want to make,
whatever you want to change and you can also just have different style it depends on you, if you
use the epi curve tool in a very good order definitely your hair will look like this,
with the help of simplification of the panels you can achieve a good result, ok
so here we have the maximum self-alliteration and all you can just decrease the value if you want
to do some, some amount of changes definitely it will work on the same ok so like this way you can
you can decrease or increase the brush size, ok so i will paint this like,
play around your values to achieve a good result if you want to just add some beard i am deleting
this for a while because we don’t require and also i think it will delete these hairs also,
this one, ok so, we don’t require then delete from here, definitely the things will be deleted
not this one and not this one, delete
if you want to play with the beard definitely you can, that means you have to give more time if you
can give more time definitely it will have a good result, ok
it’s not showing,
here it is, no problem because character is at the center so we have to shift this and
g to repeat your command w g again
like this as you can see its painting quite well just paint like this
center pivot
time taking thing you have to just keep on adjusting like this
at some part we have to adjust this manually because if you can manually adjust definitely
things can work quite well
so if you just put like this no that doesn’t work you just select this
and you just go to vertex sorry
we’ll put this character in a separate layer and reference this
now it will not select accidentally, so you have to just wrap this like this
definitely it will take some time but you will get a good result
so i have just painted in a rough way you can do it fair but i think we don’t require ok, no
so i am just skipping this part and just showing that particular part and this one, so
select all those right click we have to make one more,
this is the problem as its getting random so to fix this you have to just do
few things like just go over here right click add selected reference the same
and go to spline and just do some amount of tweaking like, this will not been look like
random because if you just adjust this definitely it will not look
select all of them, control vertex, select this, move it somehow here, select this, control vertex,
problem so what else we have to do we have to just extract that part ok so right now i will just go
you can rotate this or just put it inside the, so you can rotate this,
ok, so this is the main concept behind hair and fur inside maya application that means
if you have time you can just manipulate this according to your need or you just
put it like having a reference and just look at the reference and just put accordingly so one
more thing, see rotation is very important as you can see its just standing like this control vertex
select all of them and rotate the same one selected at a time
and just rotate the same and just insert it inside the polygon so it will look more, more
natural so that means you have to just adjust this, make here and just duplicate the same,
you have duplicate copy, duplicate special and duplicate the same, whatever you will do here
to here and here we have the extract feature, here you have the extract click over here
we will learn about the cg grooming which is also known as hair inside maya software
it will directly update here so but sometimes you have to do manual tweaking because
hair and moustache and beard that’s are not similar in both the side to keep on just
doing some random tweaking so hope you understand the same let’s switch to the next session
now that part both of them has been separate with each other and go to object mode and just select
this part or just delete this part now this part is being extracted ok so here we have the extract
feature select this part no problem we have some polys because this very high poly model
if i go to press one definitely it will show the harden view but also you can see it is so
high poly that it’s just smoothing the process if you press three definitely no cancel operation,
we don’t require to hang up my pc, so right now i will just work like this so i will select this
part press one and now again we have to just center the pivot as the pivot is been centered,
no problem and else what happens now i will just make some dummy here at the top base of the model
ok just press f this would be the top base just adjust like this you can just put some amount of
texture so that some hair will look like hair and also you can and also you can add some normal
so let’s get started, as you can see we have just imported this model and also this model
bitmap so that if you have the hair image you can just put it because right now i am using this,
this tool which is the epi curve tool which is inside curve surfaces and i will just drag
random hair and after that we’ll select all the hairs and just put
extend which is inside maya software so we are in modeling tab we have to switch to fx ok
but later wards when we will switch to fx we have n hair and now at that time we will use this make
selection curve dynamics, ok, we’ll go to its setting but at first we have to just make the
curve so that we will just put some amount of hair
ok, i am just making some amount of curves here,
g your last command will repeat right now i need to delete this as i will form again
is a very high poly so we will not put the hair all over the model what we will do
now as you can see the hairs has been formed and now what i will do select this hair all of them
and go to modify and here we have the centered pivot, control d to duplicate the same
and control d again to duplicate the same as you can see we have to adjust the hair,
align it properly as it is going out so we have to adjust like this, so this will take some time
if you have patience definitely you will can do a good result, you can achieve a good result
definitely yes and this will take some tim, no problem
and just select this and just move it somehow here
so what else we have to do, the vertex in a very good order like this ok,so, each and every thing
you have to look, right click control vertex and just control z sorry i will select this part and
we will just duplicate this model control d to duplicate it and just move it somehow here ok
just move it somehow here, control vertex select and move somehow here, make sure that each and
every hair is connecting to your surface, ok that means hair will not look floating into the
air, so make sure that just select all of them just move it somehow inside the head region
d and move it somehow here right now i have to just manual, manually do the correction process
whenever you are working make sure that you will save your file so i will save my file
now here underscore zero zero one, saved my file
you have to make the version so that if something gonna happen you can just go to that particular
version and just do whatever correction you want so version making is very important if you are
working in maya you have to work in the version so the version making is important inside maya
if i want to make the hair at the top, i will only apply in this part ok, so i will only apply in
software and also just i am just doing one more thing is that just duplicating all the thing
after that i will manually do the correction as you can see some of the hairs are floating,
floating inside some are just into the air, so we have to just manage it
it will take some time otherwise it will not look so good so that means you have to give some time
like this i just putted some of the hairs
and also here we need some amount of hair now what i will do i will select all the hairs
control d and just move it little bit, we’ll select all the hairs control d
just move it little bit here control d and move it little bit here
so that would be fine you can add more hairs if you need but
this part and i will make some random hair after that you can have the idea how you can just make
right now just for example i am showing you some of the features of hair inside maya
now what else we needed we’ll just go to the channel box and here we have the hairs
not select the model and the, this base model we’ll just make a new layer and right click
right click add selected so rename this hair save
now save your file again make sure that you are saving your file which is very important
now what else we needed we’ll just select all the hairs not this mesh, we’ll just select all the
mesh hairs sorry not the mesh one so make sure that only the hairs are been selected control z
now save file again we are in fx tab so we have in fx tab and here you have the n hair, n stands
for nucleus as we have discussed many times here we have the make select curve dynamics so i am not
implementing this particular part and just going to its settings here we
the hairs ok, so now let’s get started, as i am going to the front view and i will turn off the
have the settings, make sure that you will just reset it and because all the values will change
internally and now we don’t required the nurbs and curves because this is hard to manage
yeah you can do it well but you don’t have so much of properties as compare to the paint effects,
with the help of paint effect you will get all the panels which is present inside the n hair
it will came to the attribute editor paint effects i will not using the
make curve dynamic just putting apply ok now as you see the hairs have been applied and
we have the brownish part which is the hair, we’ll go into the attribute editor and here you
have all the things which coming across for the hair we have the hair system shape, pfx hair,
hair system, nucleus and time because this is n hair, n stands for nucleus all
the things will generate from the nucleus so we have the clump and hair shape you have
grid from here for a while and what i will do i will just right click hold your right click go to
the hair per clump you just increase the value definitely we’ll see some of the changes right
now we don’t have some changes as you can see your hair gets smooth if i zoom as you can see
here is the clump width so you can change your hair from here and there are many more
panels, we just change your hair ok, and here we have the
clump width scale so as you can see
whatever you want to do you can do it from here and here is the hair width scale,
we have to just keep on exploring whatever you want to do ok you can just put some amount of
fur over here the little bit hair, ok if you want to change the vertex of your,
face and just select the back region the downward part and delete we don’t require this part
﻿hello everyone and welcome to this session of module number forty so, in this session
from the interception help me immersively towards this end finally, as you can see
that we have just examined all the processes of a particular three d film so, each and every
created the alternate eye cameras with which they shot the brief project, image data performing any
required in painting to fill gaps in the image data, that were exposed by the parallax
little attempt was made to make creative use of stereoscopic depth the primary goal of the
process was to provide a comfortable viewing experience for the audience and towards the
end the dynamic range of the parallax was clamped at a very conservative time limits
disney’s next animated film meet the robinson released in march two thousand seven, push the
integration of stereoscopic three d deeper into the studio <?>1:54</?> process all through robinson
also alternate as a two d film and was converted to a three d by an outside vendor the studio kept
the creation of the alternate eyes, cameras, stereoscopic layout process in-house, in order
to maintain creative control of the three d depth this enabled the depth to be scripted
we will take a three d movie and do the case study on it, so let’s get started as i have taken
in a manner that were supported and enhanced the narrative of this film
later, the use of the internal in act station settings or default parallax limits the depth was
very dynamically to mirror the emotions content of the film for a short period of time so, the step
of the integration of the stereoscopic process at the studio is represented by the animated film
bolt is the story of a hollywood dog, unaware that he is starring in the television series
about the canine superhero having been led to believe the adventure and the power are real
when bolt is accidently transported across the country, he must tried to make his way home
with the help of alley cat and hamster while, coming to grab in the fact that he is a real dog,
bolt released in november twelve two thousand eight was the form its intercept produced
for both two d, three d theatrically exhibition now, we will discuss about the project philosophy
the movie called “bolt” which has came in two thousand five and we will discuss the process,
so, stated simply our philosophy on bolt was to optimize three d experience, for both in its immersive
effect and the comfort of the viewer while, using depth as a storytelling tool, it seems that cinema
for the matter storytelling is generally has had a history of innovations that tends towards
higher and higher degrees of immersive storytelling has evolved from the spoken
words of the recount hurdle around the fire to the stage performance, to the cinema of today
cinema interns has evolved from the silence black and white to talkies, color widescreen
and surrounded sound, each advance attempt to place the audience more sequentially with the
trick of the story feel amused and now digital display technology had advanced in resolution, and
dynamic range to make the alternative reality being present by the filmmaker
a more compiled illusion even non displayed related film innovation, such as the zoom lens,
each and every step from pipeline to project to execution and to achievement
or the steady camera represent a technology aim at pulling the viewer deeper into the experience
now, the second process is the managing depth so, in the stereoscopic layout process the task of the
cinematographer can be distilled to manage depth efficiently for the management of depth
to be effective, the process had to be aligned with the twin prongs
of our philosophy, for making a three d film enhance, storytelling and comfortably viewing
now, the third process is the depth score the commitment to using stereoscopic depth
as a storyteller tool decided, that there must be a constant plan for the application of depth,
that somehow would mirror the narrative content of the film a depth score analogs to a music store
is however is very crucial, if it reflect the emotion content over time
in order to guide the application of depth through the score is a constant fashion so,
so, walt disney animation studio lastly animated film bolt represent another milestone for the
the use of two somehow little visual metaphors, the first was the emotion impact of the film
content, was proportionally to stereoscopic depth being presented the second was the
emotion distance we feel from that what we see transferring on the screen
it’s proportional to our separate from in a three d space, of particularly significance to
the emotion distance is the relationship of the subject of the point of zero parallax the screen
at the depth the frameless defines a window into the scene, that can be linked to the
process art of the theater the prescribe proximation of the audience is much
greater, when a character crosses the frame line, and the risk of the carrying the analog too far
is of the audience <?>sider</?> following these two rules provide the framework for a constant
three d style for the film this rule may not be have unavailability psychology validity
studio in the integration of stereoscopic three d into the creative process and production pipeline
but, it is my belief that the audience will unconsciously learn to ascribe,
associate meaning of the particular <?>7:02</?> choices made through the courses of a film,
provided that they are present in constant fashion display space stereo parameters
is the fourth step, one of the techniques that were invaluable in order to achieve this
stereoscopic depth to follow our depth score was the adoption of our three d need to work within display
space parameters the actual <?>dis parts</?> that were ultimised to present to the viewer,
rather than concerned them themselve with the conversional stereographic parameters, such as
inter lacks distance or converging angles the camera operator could be in the same language
being employed by the depth screen only the display space parameter of near parallax for
parallax and screen position were needed to configure this stereo
disney lead to the charge into digital exhibition in two thousand five with the release of chicken
rig software would automatically mapped the parameter to camera space, distance
and then configure the inter lacks distance and conversion angle to confirm to this mapping
so, the fifth process is the composition shifting, the first technique of the
fact that the <?>insta</?> of the <?>8:22</?> pipeline was the multi
layer rendering this approach has been adopted to the studio, because of the flexibility
afforded in controlling the look of the final composite image
what is the mean of three d was the <?>8:40</?> to just the placement of the depth of individual
render layer through a horizontal offset of the final composite this allow us to take a shot that
has been composed with the telephoto lens, and set the parallax well beyond our comfort limits
so, the fact that a degree of blur or deep focusing is related to depth has been used,
little in the disney digital chicken little was turned as a post conversion of the monoscopic
as a means of adding back the third dimension to monoscopic photography, essentially making
depth of field a type of synthetic depth queue by controlling the effect within a short track
focus was created <?>9:20</?> with the sharp focus that a depth plan where the
viewer’s eyes would be covered the use of depth of field has become
such a standard part of the grammar of the film that even in computer graphics and the animated
where we are free from the physical constraint of real lenses depth of
field is often simulated in order to provide this photographic depth used to the viewer
so, the pipeline overview is one of the most primary in design criteria for the bolt pipeline
was that we would to be delivered two version of the film, one for monoscopic exhibition and one
for the stereoscopic exhibition to optimize for store and rendering requirements, a goal
film from an outside vendor disney supplied the cg scene geometric and monoscopic camera as well
was established to use the main or monoscopic camera, as the left eye of the stereo camera
led to the majority of shots for shots where the needs of two d
and three d could not been recount a unit left eye would be build for the stereo pair
such process between the two version of the film was occasionally by depth of field adjustment,
which required the generation of a new left eye imagine with matching focus or when to reduce
probability we were focused to paint out a feature appearing in only the left eye
so, finally what we have concluded through the use of the techniques that i have
outlined i believe that we succeeded in creating bolt into a stereoscopic film,
that delivered a satisfying immersive three d experience, yet, avoided the eye strain that
is too often associated with the medium the fact that every <?>store</?> was three d form,
as the rendering image level, that were used to create the final composite image the vendor then
hi everyone
up my model
what i will do, i will start posing it according to the reference and so as all the things
are there if you just look at it
so let’s start
now, what i will do i will just off the grid and we’ll select this part and will press
so, in this session we will do the posing, so it is part two and as you can see i have
new material and lambert
now, our problem has been short outed, so what i will do, i will just go to file and
make a copy save scene as, just select i think this one is fine, especially this one
so, if you select this controller at first what i will do, i will just select the body
and we’ll go to channel box and we’ll reference it so that i will not select the
body in accidentally so select the controller and just move
taken this reference and also we’ll choose any of the action pose and we’ll do the
so, here you have the controllers which has been formed
button and move here
as you can see it’s moving quite well
and we’ll select this part and rotate this
the feet
posing, so let’s continue
like if i select this firstly this part i will rotate
i will select this and we’ll go up to here, i think this would be fine
same select this, move by dragging middle mouse button
so, as you can see we have just make the pose and i will just do another posing so we’ll
select any of the files
so, we’ll not select from here, we’ll have another reference so i will save a reference
what i will do, i will just make a new plane and after that we’ll select the plane, press
so, in next session we will discuss another difficult posing inside maya application
so, let’s switch to the next session
w and after what i will do i just don’t need the segments so i will go to <?>0:40</?>
and here you have the ten which is one and minus five
so, i will select this and we’ll go to front and we’ll just rotate the same so i will
rotate it by ninety degree and okay fine
so, we’ll decrease the size and we will put it over here
﻿hello everyone, so in this session we will learn about the bouncing ball,
will break it tangent and will move further so, what we will do will break the tangent again
and will move like, so it’s not possible to tell each and everything, each and every panel
so, you have to keep on experimenting things, if this would be possible, you can do it
but, these are very simple as you know that each and everything will be applied on your particular
vertex and to break your or to attach your or to change your tangent point into the keyframe,
which is also called vertex and graph editor so, you have to just experiment the same
now, as you can see your ball is behaving better as compared to the early, so
here we have high velocity so, i select this point and you can decrease this a little bit,
as you can move from holding your middle mouse button i will do control z control z if you want
to move any of the tangent points, or any of the vertex, or any of the keyframe, you have to select
and press f for focusing your object and you will keep over here make sure that you will not
it and by holding your middle mouse button, which is also known as scroll button, you can click and
you can move easily so, that’s a main thing and selects this tangent, will move like here
so, as you can see i just press the spacebar, it’s forming irregular shape,
so what we will do just click on the move middle mouse button and move little bit
your view is being highlighted as there is a light grayish colour line, and if you select this,
your view will be highlighted so, if you select your ball and just press in this view, you can
update and you can see the updates also but, if you press here and just click it over here,
you can see the updates, and also you will find some much more difficulty
collapse, if i press four you can see, now it’s getting collapse from here and it is not good,
so, that’s the main thing you have to just keep the selective ball, and after that go to here
and just play forward or play backward so, now one more thing is that i will just call all my views
here and will update this laterward so, i will just press spacebar, right click, hold your right
click, go to perspective so, here you have the bouncing ball and now you can have a look at
how a concrete ball bounced how a rubber ball bounce, how a plastic ball bounce and or how a
if the ball is iron, how it get bounced so, you have to see the videos and work for
the same, so reference is very important if you have reference, you can work quite well,
because life example is very important in the field of animation, in every field especially in
modeling texturing, lighting, rigging, animation and dynamics, so, if you have the reference that
would be better and one more thing if you go to your timeline, here you have he timeline and
so you should just put it over here somehow over here, will press five and here is your ball
right click by right click, you have one thing is that playblast so, rather than
clicking over here, you can go to here, which is the setting and what playblast does?
playblast will generate a video clip and will show you, that means if your file get buffered then it
will produce a small video clip and will show to you so, make sure that your encoding will be in
eight point two six eight four, which is a video version, so we don’t require jpeg image sequence
so, h one two sixty four as you can required, you can use it, but for now i am using
h one two sixty four and also the size of the video, so we don't require it right now,
you can scale it or even you can have frame padding what is frame padding?
that means it is of around four, so it will just generate and also have a auto backup after every
four frames so, frame padding is there, if you want to decrease, you can decrease so, i will
so, if you are dragging something on your viewport, you find that all the things, all
put around two, so click on the playblast, and now you have the particular view all the view has apt
as it’s acting quite weird at the last, so i have to sort out it and
so i will off this and will just go here and
what i will do just select this part again, and will go to the graph editor, and will change
so, select this part and you should go to graph editor to change, and to have a good result
so, let’s switch to the next session
the parameters will change that means you have to just freeze all the parameters which you have
worked so what i will do i we’ll just select this ball and will go to
modify, and here you have the freeze transform so, what it does? it will just put all the value
zero and only scale value would be one so, freeze transforms now all the value is zero,
i will select both of them, modify, freeze transform now, one more thing is that
and also we will learn few of the things, which we have discussed earlier about timeline
so, we have made the ground, okay so if i press four, as you can see
it’s lying on the grid and we’ll modify a freeze transform we will not animate this part will
animate only the ball, so what i will do? i will go to five and will select the ball
and i will save my file at first, we have to save the file, so, bouncing bouncing ball underscore zero
zero one always make version that would be fine if something happened you can directly go to your
previous version, and just correct the same so, now we have the scene all the transformation
is zero now, what you have to do? just select and if you want to just give translation value only,
you can do it well but, i will just on all the things because i have to
work with scale or rotation, if i need it further so, what i will do just press s button,
so, we will discuss in details about the timeline and also about the bouncing balls, so let’s continue
make sure that you are in one frame and how you can increase the timeline so, here by default
which is one one twenty as you can see if you drag this particular section, you can have
the timeline, which is around two hundred so, you can zoom this like so it will zoom, so
after one frame two frame will came, three frame will came like this way, so you can just drag
if you want to increase the timeline number, that maybe the duration of time, and click over here
if you need five hundred, just press five hundred, enter, so it will convert into five hundred
so, like this way if you are in a one eighty six frame, click over here, you can go to that
particular frame so, i am in two nineteen frame, so i will zoom this like this way
you can zoom and focus inside the frame, it will just
zoom it, so, by default which is two hundred, so i will make two hundred, so will enter it
now, what will do i will just go to polygon and here you have the ball, so if you click the ball
so, one more thing one more thing is that here you have the auto key so, will on the auto key,
because if you are not using the auto key each and every frame you have to go, and just press
this s button on your keyboard so, that it will update or just put the animation key on that
particular frame so, we will not use it, we will only use the auto key at first, i will press s
as button on your keyboard, as you can see the thing has been animated in first frame
and all the translation, rotation and scale value is been animated now, what i will do i will on
the auto key and now i don’t have to press s all the time so, what i will do it’s start from this and will take
three, four, two, three, four, so we’ll take three block as you can see these are the blocks so,
we’ll take three the blocks of times and will just jump like here, and will move further
and make sure that don’t put like here,
always just put it over here so, one, two, three and will have four, so i have two two blocks
of the ball gets down as it move forward and after that sometime it will just stop,
so we’ll go here and we’ll go here and will go further and we’ll go here
will one, two, three, we’ll go here, go,
we’ll go here and we’ll keep the ball and then go further
i will go further, so i will increase the size, i think you have to shift this forward
side view, this would be fine and will move, we’ll go to front, i think front is fine okay
but it’s not looking natural so, what we have to do?
select this and will go to one sixty frame, and will put one sixty,
so after that it will follow the loop so, it’s not looking natural, as you can see
it’s not acting natural, it’s not looking natural so, what we will do as we will perspective and for a time i will
turn off the grid so, what i will do? i will select my ball and will go to any of the view
i think perspective, press spacebar and right mouse button, hold your right mouse button
so, as you can see you can change your view, so i will go to front view, so here is the front view
so, i need some more space, so i will just off this view by dragging it, and will off this view
also by dragging it and after that we don’t require this side view here, what we will do will go to panel
we are in front view and what we will do? so we’ll move little bit like here
and in panel you have the panel and in panel you have the graph editor you can also open through
window animation editor and here you have the graph editor, but, it will float like this
so, we don’t require to float because we need to fix its position, either you can just drag like here
but, that would not work properly because all the section will be smaller, and you will find
difficulty to manage so, i will just close from here, or also you can go to window and just
work here, because if we are comfortable, then you can work from here so, now i will
go to panel and i will go to the panel and here you have the graph editor, where is it?
here you can find so, now it’s change and if you want to go to your previous panel,
how you can just right spacebar, right mouse button and you can go to any of your view
so, that’s very easy if you want to drag your view, you can drag now, i will not require my
and we’ll make a new box, and just click this box and move it somehow here we’ll increase its size
another view, so i will just put like here and
will change the panel and will go to the graph editor and now if you select your ball,
what you are getting? you are getting two translations as you can see
the ball starts from its initial position, which is one, and if its goes as you found
that in fifteen frame, we have the key so, we have to manage this key particularly this one
one more thing is that, if you press shift and
and holding your alt and right mouse button you can just zoom it according to your needs, so
if you want to zoom, you can also zoom by scroll, so like this way so, i will, if you select the
key, if you move forward, as you can see it’s going up if you select this key which is here
and go downward, see ball will follow it so, we’ll select that particular section, and here you
and we’ll increase its size like this and we’ll keep it like here
can see it’s showing the white part between the two vertex, or you can say the two keyframes
so, here you have a break tangent click over here, now you can easily break, so what
happen see if i just make the curve like this as you can say this is an inorganic thing
so, you have to make like hard hard structure or hard shape inside your
tangent, and inside your graph editor so, i break the tangent over here also,
as you can see what happens next? here we haven’t updated the same so, will update,
but at first let’s check is it working or not it’s now getting tipped
here you can found its getting tipped, but after that it’s getting behaving like
weird it’s quite behaving weird here, because we haven’t changed this so,
we will pause this for a time, and i will go up to here will change this particular section,
so, now as you can see our box and ball both are formed and i will just keep this ball,
﻿hello everyone, so welcome in this session so, what i will do i will go to the great angle
you can press alt and middle mouse button to have a panning, and will select this part,
let’s have a look
it’s not touching,
will zoom this, i think its fine so, now the problem has sort outed, as
you can also just click this part and just move little bit forward, and just go up to here
here so, now you have the problem which is sort outed as you can see,
of and will go to the graph editor so, go to panel and here you have the panel feature and
so, now you have the idea, how you can animate simple objects and how you can change the
tangent into graph editor, and how you can just work in the graph editor for handling the tangent
and all so, in next session, we will discuss about you can say the poses and also we will
just follow some references for that particular pose so, let’s meet to the next session
graph editor, and after that we have to adjust the last section so, press spacebar, right click
and front view and will select this part, and after that you get all the features here
and so now what i will do i will say go here and just play forward, let’s see
so, it is too far, so press your middle mouse button, you bring it little bit of near
and also you can just add extra extra key points here, so but we don’t require as we
only have this amount of frame if you want to work quite well, because the auto key is on,
on you just you can animate further so, like this way you can work and, now see
what i have to do? you decrease the size little bit, and
hello everyone
if you are working in light you have to check through the render tab, but if you are currently
moving around your viewport or if you are examine anything particular section, you can
press four because, see, the scene is getting lighter
but if i press seven, what happens, the scene will be heavier
so, by pressing four, you can go at that particular place
now, one more thing is that, if you select any of the particular object and if you go
to arnold and in lights, here you have the mesh light
so, what mesh light does, if you click here and i have press the seven, now you see, it’s
converted into a light
now, as with the help of this, you can also go to your additional parameters
so, in previous tutorial we have learned about the arnold physical sky, but in this tutorial
now, you have all the things which suits and which you can change according to your needs
so, now, it’s converted into mesh light and you can also change from here the light
visibility
for a test, i will just render a particular image
so, at first, i will just check all the things are in low quality, ok fine
now, i will just make a test render and what we will get, will get nothing because that
light has, you can say, vanished
so, what we will do, here you have light visibility
maya, this is transform attributes
we will learn more about its and we will add some more lights from arnold render engine
so, we don’t require this
so, here, you have the show original mesh, no, we don’t required mesh
colour is fine
so, you can go over your intensity, just play around your intensity
i will just on the <?>2:56 </?> if you want to change the colour of your light, yeah,
definitely you can do it well
if you see the leaves, the lower part is getting shadow as compared to the upper part
so, you have the idea about how you can change the light and all
so, here we have another most important thing which is ies lights
and also we will look at some of the additional parameters inside attribute editor
so, here have a couples of different presets of ies lights, which is available in google by free
so, you can go to any of the website which provides ies light and you can download for
max, maya or any other three d software
so, you have the ies lights, as i just open any of them, okay now you have the both ies light
its file extension is ies file and it’s very small in size
so, now, what i will do, for ies lights, you have this photometric light
so, this will allow you to create some ies lights
if you click over here, now your photometric light has form, where it is, here
i will press four for a time, go to here, press f, you focus this particular section
now, just put it over here
so, let’s continue
you can work in perspective if you are forming the light
but make sure that whatever you work in perspective, you just have to just rotate around your axis
to see the correct position
if it is going in the correct direction then it is okay otherwise you have to maintain it
or even if you are not comfortable in perspective, you can go to any other section, that is front,
side and top
or even, if you press shift button and right click button, by holding shift and right click,
you can change any of the view in your maya
so, that’s a very much freedom as you are not comfortable in perspective
so, to have a look at each and every lines
so, what we have?
so, if you select, we don’t required white colour because already we have so much of
white colour lights
now, i will change it to any other colour
so, i will just put some amount of lighter green <?>5:10</?> lighter blue and all
that’s good
white, back of it is white, no problem
just focus in this <?>sactioust</?>
change it through attribute editor and there is a problem in selecting, you can go to outliner
and here you have all the features
if you want to select this point and you can’t select it because there is a mesh also
we have this scene
make sure that you have to rename each and everything properly otherwise you will be
in problem laterwards if you have very much thing inside your scene
so, you can also change your letter from here
and one more thing is that, there are much more options, if you select this light, specially
this one and go to attribute editor and here inside this panel, we have so much more panels
like sub surface scattering, diffuse, specular, indirect or volume which is by default present
in your render settings also
but these are different and these are different
this is basically inside the light and this is basically when your scene will be rendered,
after that it will apply the same
so, for a purpose i will just press four
so, if you can keep increasing its value then also it takes some render time
so, now what we will do, will just use some of the normal lights here and we will start
render with it
four is basically for wireframe
so, it’s very easy to handle the wireframe
hello, welcome to this module thirty six ‘science of color’
i hope you will enjoy the session and will be benefitted
so, let’s start this module thirty six that is ‘science of color’
hope you must have enjoyed the earlier classes discussing the various aspects of ‘science
of animation’ like three d modeling, texturing, shader, lighting, etcetera
myself doctor arjun singhal, associate professor, department of computer science, banaras hindu
university is going to discuss the science of color, which is essential for developing
a high end aesthetic sense in animation design
color plays a vital role in computer graphics and with the recent technological advancements
it has become an essential part of the science
in this class we will be discussing the elements of design, color theory, primary colors, secondary
﻿i will delete all the lights one by one and i just have only one light
we need so little bit of bounceness over here and will put some lights like this and after that,
what we have, we have the back part so, will select this light only
and control d, will move here and just move here and what i will do,
just simply grab this, press r for scale and will scale this and will tilt it, so that its position
is just straight of it so, just press seven and have a look that if this is quite well or not
i think it’s quite fine and okay we have to work in the omni because you can select from here
you can work in the omni because it’s bouncing so much, we need
a little bit of bounceness, not this amount of so, will just decrease the intensity by
little bit of lower and what happens if you have negative value in light?
if you have negative value, it will just absorb the nearby light's intensity so,
in this particular section of light so, let’s quickly set up a particular scene
will not put any negative value if you can, you can have inside a particular big large screen
in studio, the artist use the negative intensity to absorb nearby light intensity
also you can put some of the small lights here or you can use the spotlight or even
the directional but directional will change your whole scene so will not use
you have the area light which is same as this one so, like this way also, you can have
more lights we have proper lighting i think this one is fine this we have to work
we will use some amount of omni here also and we will also shift this omni downward if
the omni will shift downward, then it will fall the whole surface here so, we don’t
require any light here because it’s already fine and what we will do, will just select the omni,
move little bit of down and what we will do, will increase the intensity little bit
for our lighting so, i have just erased all the lights and we have only one light
now, what else we have, select this, will go downward and all the things is fine
so, will go to render settings and will increase the camera aa by eight, diffuse by, i think six,
specular, exactly we need specularity, so i think six transmission level, will not just increase
it very much because it needs ram power and sub surface scattering instead of using transmission
so, it will produce some amount of glow
in organic character modeling, especially in human modeling, we use sub surface scattering in skin
but we have mushroom in this section, so we will use this sub surface scattering little bit
so that it will just illuminate the light in its corner and in the top
so, volume indirect, volume indirect will increase by two
ray depth, we don’t require ray depth and here also we have specular, but we don’t require ray
here and one more thing is that, if you want to erase this light you just do one more thing, then
depth because we have just work in the sampling now, what we will do, will go to view and go to
bookmark, camera view so, i will just pause this video and will show you the render image
and you may have the better idea that how we can adjust by few tweaking the light and its
you just select that particular section, press delete now, your mesh light will be deleted
and now let’s quickly set up a scene for our lighting and what i will do, i will just go to
the seven view and just put some of the lighting at first will go to six, control d and will put
some lighting over here and have a look and what we will get after that, let’s have a look
will set the colour and the intensity laterwards, but will adjust the light at first, will go to
render tab and here we have the point light which is omni will put some of the point light because
﻿hello everyone so, as you can see, we have rendered this
you can say the gamma value which is zero point ninety so,
we have this scene which we have rendered already setup in arnold we have used the lights and
so the textures are simple which is basically mental ray textures
and so, as you can see, all the things are in soft, producing very soft and i am going to
the render settings as we have discussed also the camera aa value is eight, diffuse is six,
specular is six, transmision four, sub surface scattering three and volume indirect will be
two if you increase this, ten, it will produce more smooth result so, the points points like
structure which is cranes will not even happen here so, that’s the main reason
that’s why i just put it eight and yeah it will take some time to render the same
and this is the quality which is hd seven twenty p so, if you are working in ten eighty p, it will
particular model and after that as you can see, we have some soft bounceness over here
take maximum time and if you are working in four k, so it will take huge amount of time that’s the
main reason so, i have rendered this in half hd and okay so, you can change each and everything
so, right now we are in arnold, so better to have arnold render because you know the parameters
of lighting of the arnold we have the skylight, half of the thing will be done in skylight because
it’s a global light and it will produce some sort of bounceness and after that
to fix the particular part, you have to use the area light or even the omni or even the you can
say ies lights which is photometric light so, with the help of the arnold you can also go to
normal rendering tab, here you have and you can use all the maya software lights like
directional light, spotlight, area light or even point lights so, like this way, you can
work quite well and also, you can work with the arnold light that means you can work in both
and also from here so, we have some lightness and the sun shadow which is producing here and
if you are in arnold parameter, you can work in normal rendering lights and also arnold light
so, you can combine both of them but if you are in this particular thing, that means if you change
your render settings to maya software, you can’t work in arnold because all the parameters will
set to the maya software so, that means you have to go to the arnold, so that you can use both of
them, this rendering tab and also the arnold feature so, that’s the main reason behind it
so, now you have the idea how you can produce some sort of smooth light with
the help of arnold and also we will combine that thing with the maya software lights
so, that’s the morning light, you can say, and i think you understand quite well so, these
things you can adjust by yourself, it depends on you, how much value you want to take
so, i think, we should switch to the next session
this area is contrasting well so, we have used the physical sun and sky
and all the things is bouncing here so, as you can see, we have more features like this one,
which is the exposure and the <?>gamma</?> so, you can just grab this to have a clear look
as you can see, so like this way you can work quite well if you are satisfied with this result,
you can do it or you can also go it here and just change the values if you
need some much of lighter as you can go here and also you can just put it like this
so, that’s totally depend on you i just put it the exposure value which is one point sixty three and
﻿hi everyone so, welcome in this course of baking texture and light in maya so, baking is very
texture into medium or low quality, according to the need of the director in the game
so, we have this convert to file texture and uv range is by default and one more thing is that,
as we have discussed about the shadow of the light, if you increase the shadow, definitely the
shadow would be smooth, soft if you decrease the level, it would produce raster and it
will form some blocks and same in this also if you need your texture to be very much detailed
in high quality, then you have to just increase the resolution so, i will increase by one zero
two four, you can increase more than that but i am using zero two four so, i will just
enter it if you want to increase three thousand, you can increase that would be the texture would
look very much detailed and all so, jpg file format, we have chosen the jpg file format
and will go to convert and close so, if you converted, it will automatically
but at first, i will do one more thing, will just select this part and
close this panel, this particular one so, let’s check each and everything is fine or not
transparency, we does not have any transparency object here,
so will not choose that one so, right now, i will just go to convert and close now,
it’s converted and as you can see, new textures has formed here okay
so, now, what i will do, as you can see, it has lowered the quantity,
quality of the texture and if i increase by two thousand more than that, it will definitely
work quite well so, as you have know that we have <?>13:43*</?> opened the uv,
you can open the uv and just put the texture, so the texture will not stretch like this okay
so, no problem, we have to focus in the baking of texture, as you know how to open the uv,
how to implement the texture in the model you have to select each and every part at first
object mode, control g to group it and will go to window and here we have the outliner,
so, at this time, we have just closed this one and will select this part this is the
top and bottom select by holding shift,
edit and same convert to file texture maya software convert and close
now, new texture has formed will select this part so, this is the lambert six and
will go to edit and here we have the convert to file texture maya software, click here
just select this part, go to ground because we need the light, we need the shadow to be bounce
into here because we have a ground so, will go to edit, convert to file texture
maya software, click here, convert and close so, right now, we have converted, as you can see,
the shadow has formed here so, the shadow has formed and right now what else we have to do, just
rename this after that, will select
close this part and now we will go to the render settings and in render settings, we have
this features all render using now, i will change to mental ray
as we have changed to mental ray, i will go to features and just see that global illumination
caustics is off because we are baking the texture and if we increase this or check this,
definitely the time will increase render features and all, so i will just check each
and everything is fine here, we have to just open this one, including the shadow and contours,
we will go down, let’s see rest is fine now, i will just go to indirect lighting,
make sure that i will just off this global illumination and final gather
as it will take maximum time so, i will just off this and now, what i will do, i will go to
this panel and will change to rendering so, after getting to rendering we have a particular
this group and will scale it down, okay scale it down and will just put it over here so, press f,
section called light and shading so, will go this panel and if you are not selecting anything in the
model, no problem, we go to light and shading and in light and shading, here you have the
particular section of batch bake mental ray so, will not click here, will go to its settings
so, when you click the settings, here is the setting and we have object to bake all
if you have selected something, you can go to selection, but we will bake all the objects and
one more thing, bake optimization, multiple objects, okay fine we need to bake the shadow
because we needed the shadow because we have used the light rest are fine
now, it will take some time, as, if you click on convert and close it will take some time
and after that, it will, right now it is calculating and it’s done now, you can
delete the light if you delete the light, it will not affect your scene because
so we don’t have to collapse it we will just put somehow like this so, now, what we will do,
your scene is now become the proxy and will render the same data let’s have a look
so, as you can see, it is baked and now, if you increase the size of the
shadow, definitely it will produce some more good result so, right now, as we can see the shadow
quantity is not fine here, but in rendering, it is not like that as you can see, if you delete
the light, then also your shadow, your texture will be there so, like this way you have to just
work and make sure that whenever you are working, if you select any model, open it uv at first
and then apply the textures if you have some inorganic thing,
like particularly the bike and all, you can use shaders as well and if you are using any
character and all, you have to open the uv, then you will just put the texture and do your baking
of texture and lighting in it so, we will discuss this more,
will just select the plane and also will go to the polygon tab and will add some random edges
but in next tutorial i will take a high poly car and will lower it’s all the settings like
the shadow settings and the texture settings so, we will form a proxy model of that car
with the help of baking of texture and light in maya so, let’s switch to the next session
like this so, as you can see, we have just added some random edges and will move here, right click,
object mode, select the plane and will go to the mesh and here you have the smooth so, now, your
plane is been smooth and also, what else we have to do? i will just select each and every part and
put some textures so, this would be the sword at first, there is the history as you can see,
important, if you are working for a game project or if you are making some game models and all,
there is a lot of history so, i will select the model and will go to edit, delete by type
history as you can see, all the history has gone, only three things are there so, i will select
this part and right click, assign new material so, before assigning, i will go to the render
settings and make sure that it’s in maya software we will not use mental ray right now, we will
switch it to mental ray laterwards why this going to happen, we will discuss it in the session
so, will select this part, right click, hold your right mouse button, assign new material
and here would be the blinn and we have some textures also so, i will go to colour and will
just put some texture from here will have the file and will click over here and sword texture,
have the steel texture as, if i press six button, you can see the steel texture
so, now i will select this part and will rename this, blade region
you have to bake what is baking? that means the lights you use in the maya and the texture you use
will select this both, right click, assign new material and will use the lambert because this
would be dull and will use the colour, go to file, click here and the elastic part,
so, we will not open the uv because we have to just discuss about the fundamentals,
so we will not focus on the uv you can do it, well, if you press one, you can
just open the uv, but we will not use uv in this because we have to just focus on the
fundamentals of baking of textures and lighting because uv we have already discussed about the uv
in a previous class and also we have make some separate tutorial for uv
so, will select both of them and will rename this,
top and bottom so, rename is very important if you go to window and here you have the
rendering editors and in rendering editors, you have the hypershade so,
in the maya so, after baking the light and the texture all combine in that model and the light
if you don’t rename your model, you will be get confused so, we will use the hypershade so, if
you renamed it that would be fine so, select this part and will assign new material and will use the
lambert itself and will create the colour so, i will put some jute texture here so,
you can put it as per your need so, i will put some jute texture and will rename this handle
so, now, we have this sword and after that will select this, will go to assign new material,
will just select the blinn and i will put some normal texture so i will go to colour
tiles or any other checkered type of texture so, now it has been applied, as you can see, so it has
been applied, so here it is the default container has come, so, no problem, now we have these,
and it’s shadow, it’s intensity and all the parameters of the light will behave
now, it does not casting any shadow and all so, what we will do, will just select
any of the lights from the rendering tab, here we have the lights so, will just use
a directional light you can use point light or even spotlight, area light and the ambient
and all so, i am using the directional light and if i just increase the size of the light,
if i go up to here, will move here, will move somehow here, and will press seven button
you can see this the model is getting light, the light is casting into the model,
if you rotate the light, definitely your model will just have the light and all so,
i just put it over here if i look at the model, what we are getting? let’s have a look
okay fine so, now, what we will do,
at first i will just decrease the render size because right now we are in testing mode so,
as a texture in that model so, let’s have a look about the baking of texture and light in maya
what we will do, will select this light and in light, you have directional light shape
and in light, you have shadows so, we have a very simple model and the model is also very
low poly and we don’t have any other model in this scene so, our scene is quite lighter so,
you can increase this shadow by use depth map shadow and can increase the resolution
now, if you look at your shadow, you will find that there would be some noises, as you can see
this is because to the resolution is five twelve if we increase this by two thousand, what happens?
your shadow would be not so pixelate so, if you increase this, if you have a heavy model,
definitely the render time will take much more as compared to the lighter model
so, make sure that you will have a good pc, you can increase this resolution and also if you have
the good pc, you can work in this particular, which is filter size, bias and all,
so, for that, what i will do, i have some models at first, i will select this part,
shadow intensity so, these are the features of shadow
you can increase the filter size that will take some time to render, obviously yes
so, now, as you can see, it’s getting little bit of faded at the corners if you increase
the filter size, definitely it will effect so, right now, we have the sword and the directional
light only one light i am using, you can use two or three lights according to your need
so, what i will do now, as i will go to the window and here we have the
rendering editors so, in rendering editors, we have the hypershade hypershade is just like that
of, if you select any object and just press right mouse button and just go to its property just like
assign new material whatever you get in here, you will all get in the hypershade
so, if i click and just drag, you can see, these things are same in your assign new material so,
which is the sword model and i will just go to maya files and have this model to be imported
that means hypershade has more freedom to manually select all the things one by one
so, if you want to select, you just have to click and just go to its attribute and select
the same but hypershade has these features also which is the sub features of hypershade
as you can have different things here so, that means if you want to work more
detail in texture, you can have to understand the concept of hypershade so, now, will just select
the model at first one by one will select the model and as you know that we have just
renamed this blade region which is <?>fong</?> i think so, here you have that particular one
so, i will select this one, shift select this texture which is been implemented to
it and what else we have to do? will go to edit and in edit you have very much panels
but we will focus only in one panel right now so, here you have the convert to file texture
so, convert to file texture, maya software so, am not using this one i am using its
settings so, i will go to its settings now, a dialogue box has opened so,
make sure that your anti-alias will be off we are not using anti-alias so,
it would be off that means it will take maximum times now, background mode is a shader default
and fill texture seams, okay this would be check, bake, we have to bake the shading group lighting
and we need shadow to bake so, after that, when it gets over we will delete this light and your
model will be lighted as compared to this one that means if you have extra lights, if you have
many more features like ies and all in the light, you can just bake the light and the
texture so that your scene would be lighter that means, in gaming in gaming industry,
the artist uses this baking system to have high poly games into low and high quality
what else we have to do? we just have to make a plane and
as previous we have discussed about it
so, the texture would be in low quality, after when we just hit on convert and close
the texture would change from this to have a low quality as compared to this one, because
we're using six hundred, you can use two thousand, three thousand
so, to avoid the render time, i will just go to convert and close
now, we will focus on next part and as you can see a texture has been converted
and now getting rusted, as you know about if you increase the value definitely, your
texture look quite well
but now, it's getting rusted because we are in low quality and, we'll select this part,
but at first we'll move, we'll select this part, all of them, one by one, control z
one more thing we have to do, we'll select this part, control h, control h, control h,
so, we have selected all the body parts
control h, control h
we'll just select the seat, which is here, shift select, edit, convert to file texture
"maya software"
so we don't require transparency and convert, so now it takes some time to do the conversion
and after, that this panel window will close, then you can revoke this, yeah it's done
select the ground, because we also have to do it, as the shadow will cast here only
view and in rendering view we have this panels
so, we'll just have to shut it
and now what we will do, right click
and one more thing, if i go to the direction light, we have decrease the value of shadow
so, as you can see, if you increase the resolution size, definitely your time will take
so, we have just using five-twelve
so the shadow would be of low quality and the textures
okay
you can just have one thousand or two thousand, if you are working in simple model
if you have a good pc configuration, you can just increase the resolution
as the shadow will provide smoother
okay so we'll not focusing in the resolution, because you have to just take the idea, how
you can bake the texture and light
assign new material, or we have the material which is "phong"
but you know about the depth map shadow, and also the raytrace shadow
so we have just of the raytrace shadow, as it will provide some amount of transparency
and glossiness, because if this provides then definitely a scene will be heavy
so, just click the depth map shadow and the resolution is five-twelve which is low
you can increase it if you have a good pc configuration, and if you're working in a
heavy model
you can go to one thousand or two thousand in between them
so, now we'll not use this part as the shadow will provide, which would be rough and all
so, no problem
let's select this ground, and what we will do, we'll just have a look at the ground,
okay, no problem
which is the lambert
as you can see, here it would be updated, as we have selected it and you can have a
better texture of concrete and all, but just for your knowledge, i just sharing all the
things
you can just change according to your needs
now once again we have to click because, there is the big transparency, convert and close
now, it's just converted and what we would do next, so we'll just close this
we don't require now, as if i just see the shadow because we are in low quality shadow
which is five-twelve, i think
so as you can see, the shadow quality is not good, but you can change it as you have the
we can use, and in blinn we have "car body"
idea, how you can change it
so, see this shadow quality is not good and you can change it quite well, you have the
idea
you just have to just work and just select this part
inside attribute editor, in direction light shape, you have the shadow parameters
so, just open the depth map shadow, increase the resolution
by one thousand to two thousand
then it will produce a smooth and soft resolution
now, the next thing is that very important, which has go to render settings
in render settings, we doesn't have any features here, because there are only two tabs
so, i will rename so that, when we do the touching thing, we will never forget the same
so what we will do, now we will just go to "mental ray"
as by switching to mental ray, you have the feature parameter, feature tab
so we'll select the feature tab and we'll uncheck all them, because we don't require
"global illumination" and "caustics", because baking is only for games
nowadays it's also applying in movie, but maximum cases it's done only for gaming purposes
few movies like animated movies, they use baking purposes for their shots and all
but maximum times it uses in games, so shadow is checked on, fine
and everything is fine i think
contours, let's see the contours
in feature
so as you can see, few parts has been left
here, click here, in light and shading
so in light shading, you have one more feature which is "batch bake mental ray"
as we are in mental ray, and we'll go to indirect lighting, at first just check global illumination
and final gathering is off
if this will be on then, your render time will take two times more, as compared to the
without having this opened
okay that means if you open this, it will take two times more
if you have a good pc configuration then
so we'll just off this, now, we'll just cut this thing, because we don't require
so i will select one by one and do all the corrections and all
and we have to go to the lighting and shading parameter, which is at the top
and in that particular one, we have batch bake which is mental ray
so we'll not click here, just go to settings
here we have the settings and in settings we have, object to be "bake all"
if you select any object you want to make that particular, you can just go to select
but we need to bake all the things here, now all the things is been bake
and baked to texture
that means your shadow, your light, your reflection will all form into texture, that means you
can delete your light, but your scene
and also if you have multiple lights in your scene, your scene will be heavy
okay, so as we have selected this and we'll go to the colour, click over here
so, if you're working for game modelling and all, you have to just co-relate the light
with the model, for baking and all
and after that you can delete the light, your scene will be lighter
okay because in gaming mostly the model is low poly and the complete model is very lighter
as compared to the movie
so, now what we will do, we just go to bake to "texture", fine
bake optimisation, which is multiple objects
bake shadow, yes definitely we require shadow
and bake to camera perspective, okay so, now we don't require this "keep original shading
network" and "use bake set override"
here is the file, so i have the texture of this ferrari, so i will select the texture
so, in this we will take another model
because this will take huge amount of time, and also it will not proper, because we have
already decreased the size of the shadow from the direction light
and also, we have decreased the size of the texture, so we don't require this
rest are fine i think
now what we will do, convert and close
so as you can see here, it's processing
hope you understand the same, let's meet to the next session
we'll open it, so as you can see, if you press six, your texture has been wrap
but, there is a problem
so what we have to do, we have to flip the texture
so i will select one by one, make sure that you're in polygon and we'll go to edit your
<?><?/> and here you have the "flip"
click over here, as we will open this option and will just check
nice!
so as you can see it's applied quite well
and fine, now we'll select this part, fine
select this part, fine
so, what i will do, i will take the another model
select this part, fine
so, if i select all of them
so, i have the same textures like here we have the same textures
and we'll just right click, assign existing material and here we have the glasses
okay, so we'll just put it over there, and as you can see these are the "shaders", so
i think we don't require it
but yes, we have to just focus in the inside part
so, we'll just select all them
control "h" to hide the same
if i go up here go up here and drag it
we'll select, right click, assign existing material
we'll select the interior, so here we have
i think it's fine, we can just have put it some textures, as you can see
it somehow over here
and in mesh tool we have "insert edges", so we'll put two edges
now we'll select this part, we'll move forward
and let's see, if i go to mesh and here we have the "smooth"
so, once again we'll smooth the same
so as you can see, the part is been smooth quite well and we have this
as you can see, our car has been imported in our maya
now, i will select this assign new material, and we need the "lambert", and we'll go to
the colour
and i will just put file for just reference purpose, so only for reference purpose, okay?
so now as you can see it has been applied
make sure that whenever you're working you should be in maya software, after that we
will just switch to "mental ray"
so, we'll just off this and we have this setup
so now, i will use this direction light, and we'll focus it
so, as you know that if you're comfortable, you can use three or four light and it would
be better to use three or four light, okay?
so at first, we have to do couples of adjustment
so that would be fine, and if i press seven, what we will see, we'll see this part and
we'll just rotate this, like this
and also, just rotate this like this
okay?
so make sure that we will make a new version
so we'll go to the first, and we'll just make new version
and after that, well shadow is not generated over here, so what we will do we will generate
the shadow
and now what happens see, if i look at the render, i think shadow will not be visible,
see shadow is not visible
so, i will select each and every part and we'll rename the same
so we have to work on the shadow
at first, i will just decrease the size of the image, and six forty four eighty because
we have to examine at first
so, my direction lights been selected and we'll go to attribute editor, here we have
the shadow parameter
so i will use "depth map shadow"
we will not use raytrace, because we have to bake the shadows also
so i will use the depth map shadow
we'll go to the window, and in window here you have the rendering editors
and in rendering editors you have hyper shade, so this is the hyper shade
so this would be class one, ok fine
if you drag this you will found this thing, which if you right click, the thing which
came from here, assigning material or any of them it will always show up here
so in maya, one thing has to feature that means you can open like this way also, and
by this way also
so, what i will do, we have selected this shape, and we have the car body
so i will shift select this part and we'll go to "edit", and in edit here you have the
convert to file texture via software
we will use this part, click, and you will get box "dialogue box"
we'll select all the body parts, by holding shift you can select all the body parts one
so anti alias is off, and background mode is shader default
that would be fine, so right now as we have seen the resolution will very much effective
if you increase the resolution size, the texture would be look quite well
if you decrease the size, the texture will be rusted or it will be in low quality
so, as we have many parts, to avoid it i will just use little bit of it
we'll not use two thousand, one thousand or any other value
we'll just put it, i think six hundred by six hundred
so, i know that it will just ruster because we're using this value, but you know that
if you increase two thousand or three thousand, definitely your texture would be more smooth
and also it looks like your jpg, which you have just inserted on your model
by one
in session number twenty or the module number twenty, we will learn about the blend shape
that you just have to click all the particular one, and just of this the angry and the objects
like this way you have to just can use very expressions according to your need that means
you can make more expressions, so then play with the settings, so in the channel box
like this way you can add different things
so, as you have understand the concept of blending shapes inside maya application, with
the help of animation and creative deforms, blend shape and in the setting panel so,
now you can animate easily and you can also use expressions like this, can also use all
the expressions so, with the help of this you can have a good result, and also you can
work quite well and with the help of blend shapes, so you can have animation into the
facial morphing and all so, i think we should meet to the next session
will select the model and what i will do i will make this at first will rename this main
so, i will just control d duplicate it will move it here
morphing means that if i do some modification here in the duplicate, it will directly automatic
update into your main model so, i have to make as much as model as i need for reference
and for expression so, if you are doing if you imply painting three or four expression,
you need to your four models if you are implementing more than hundred expressions, you need hundred
around one, two, three, four four models
you can do it five twenty, thirty, forty it depends on you in studios in high rise movies
they use around one thousand, two thousand morphing in particular, so, will just focus
or you can say the facial rigging pipeline so, in this session we will learn, we will generate the
on four, four types of expression so, if you know the fundamentals, you can work with
many expressions so, you should have a reference, or you can also watch videos or also can examine
yourself that if you are wording something or talking about which muscle are moving on
your face, so that’s very important
i will select this model and what i will do i will just at first you can rename this,
press b, because right now i don’t need a soft brush if i go here, now i can need
soft brush, so you can press b, and you can increase the fall-off like this so, this
to do as you can see our soft selection has updated, if you press b, it will automatically
several kind of stylizations of face, and how you can morph that all blend shape in
off so, press b it will update, if you hold a b, and right mouse button and drag it will
just decrease the size of your brush and also the fall-off area
so, that means if you select one one segments, it will automatically update all the segments
if you of the b what happens? if you just drag like this, it will just create the point
of that particular vertex, so press b now, you can move it will move that whole area
by affecting all of them so, now i will go to the brush will select this part, will select
this part, so as you can see
if we will not put any symmetry
because when we do some expression,
maya application, we will learn in this session so, let’s switch to the maya software and
move it upward, move it here
have look how you can work with the blend shape in maya software
i shift selecting and will go to this tool, and select this part and also select this part
just select this only area
now, we’ll go to this area and we select shock and
hi everyone and welcome to this course of morphing inside autodesk maya so, in this
and just forming its shape, so will select this part, and it’s have just look this
part move it so cannot <?></?> and
use the symmetry
because we are definitely our skin when just doing some expression and we are just talking
session we will do morphing inside autodesk maya so, morphing i i have model and i will
and now this would be i silent, so will change the name silent
so, what i will do? i will select all the parts or you can also select by shift, so
i will select all the parts and after that the last part which is the main part, i will
select shift, by pressing shift and click over here so, as you can see this part is
the last part, i will go to the animation tab, in animation tab you have create deformers
so after that you have the blend shape, so you don’t have to go over there, you have
to open its settings so, in blend shape go to edit and reset, origin is local that means
it will access from local, local will and also envelope is one
so, no problem, so you can increase this angle of blend by putting it one, so can you create
it, and after that it will just create the same so, as you can see you have created
these shapes and if you click here and just go to the channel box, and you found input tab
here in input tab you have blend shape one, so you have all the parts now a silent,
shock, angry, smile, so if i zoom this, as you can see i will just click in the silent
or i click here, it’s highlighting in blue so, in the viewport if you press your scroll
button, and just move it like here or like here, now it’s changing
same with the shock select this by pressing your middle mouse button, move it here or
up here now, what i will do? i will just select this face and will go to modify and
which is also known a morphing so, you have all the expressions like this so, if you
want to animate, definitely you can just select all of them, or just select only one model,
press s as you can see it’s been updated so i am in auto key mode, if you click this,
you don’t have to just put s every time so, i mean auto mode so as you can see we
are in going to blend shape and i have just animated all of them and if you go up here, you can
find that it’s affecting quite well
so, over the help of this all, you can just have a good result by having animated all
of them one by one you can have to find a new expression with the help of them, as you
can see so like this way you can work you have to go to the input blend shape, and after
freeze transformation so, as you can see all the values has turned into zero, so now
﻿hello everyone, so welcome to this topic of animation and timeline so,
points and all the coordinate system of our box is turned into zero, now you can animate
so, there are two ways to animate, one at first you just have to set few of the keyframes for
a particular animation and after that you will go to graph editor or dope shape for good animation
view, or even good animation refine a purpose so, that means at first you have to animate by
simply going to the keyframe and put some keyframes, and after that you will go to
dope sheet or graph editor for more you can say for more refinement so, there are very different
terms in organic as well as inorganic animation, but, the concept is same so, if you have this
box, if you want to animate, there are two ways at first if you want to move in only one one axis,
which is this one, just go over there, and right click and key select like this or even
if you use the shortcut key like s, it will key all the things which is present over here
in this session we will learn about the basic concept of animation and timeline,
suppose, i am in first frame, i just select this and put s now, all the things has been animated
and now we are in animation mode i will go to twenty frames and will put here and press s,
ok as you can see it will travel from here to here, so as you go here and i will put e
which is for rotation, and will rotate the same like this, and will put like s and after that
it’s getting animated and just circulating and if you want to only focus in only one part,
you have to select this key select but, now you have animated so that
will not happen now, because all the coordinate system has animated
as if you just deselect it or just deselect the animation, all the key frame will be gone
so, if you want to select the keyframe here which is select by shift clicking, if you just select the
so let’s continue so, here in modeling tab you should go to animation at first,
model, and after that the keyframe will be shown over here right now we don’t have any keyframe,
because we haven’t selected the model if you select the model, now the red lines which is
the keyframe will be shown over here by pressing shift and just drag all
to the red and after that you may have the yellow handles so, you can just select the
yellow handles, and you can move your keyframe like here, if you want to display your keyframe
here and there like this way control z for back and just select shift and just select all there,
and if you want to add the distance between the keyframe just click like this and you can
move quite well, so, that’s the main thing of moving your keyframe if you want to move
this keyframe from here, so you can have this handle and you can move from here
so, all the things will be done in shift, by pressing shift you can do it well select
after that all the panels at the top of your list will change now, we have the animation
this model, press shift, select any of the key and you have the yellow handles, you can move
your keyframe like this so, you have all the freedoms that how you can move your keyframes,
and if you want to adjust, you can adjust it well by this if you select this part and press s,
there is no any you can say there is no any problem to animate all the things, because
if you are working in detail animation of obviously you will not work like this, because
this is a concept and be very important so, that you have to just select each and
every key and do the animation, sorry, each and every translation and just do the animation
so, one more thing is that in window here you have the animation editor, and here you have the
graph editor, and dope sheet which is different as compared to both of them so, you can click
the graph editor, if you click, there would be a graph editor which is showing over here
tab over here also and we will discuss this one by one so, for animation what we have to do?
now, it’s showing the curves, what is this? we will discuss in next lesson
and now what more thing is that if you animating something like a particular object or particular
thing if you are moving like this, it’s moving here and here if you are not pressing
s button, if you move forward, it will not animate the same, see it doesn’t happen if you press s
and just move forward, then it will happen so, to avoid it what you have to do? here you found
one one of the most important thing, which is auto auto key here you have the auto key if you click
okay here and you can animate your box, as you will go, you don’t have to put
pressing s you will just click, as you can see it is generating the keyframe automatically
so, like this way if i go to just position and like this it’s moving here, and in between them,
it just gone the top that means it will just you have to slow, and autokey is basically on, so
i will go to have a new box and make sure that whatever you are animating,
it will create a slow and after that it will go to the ground so, after that it will just go
here and there and after that it will move at its certain position and if you want to scale this,
well you can scale, scale this up and scale this it will automatically scale this down, because we
have the animation key which is set earlier so, this is very important that means rather
than i am going to anyone, and just click key select, and you can do by pressing s and after
that all the things will be updated, and you just click here for your animation view so, as you can
say it’s moving here and right click if you go to by pressing your right mouse button, which is
right click and here you have the playback speed, so, play every frame free if you go to real time,
then what happens? see, it will go to the real time it will just go to the real time and here
you have the all the playback features so, i will go to the playback speed and play
the coordinate system should be zero so, if you click over here and drag it,
every in frame free so, there is one more option for real time, not exactly play every frame,
maximum to the real time so, this is the every frame which is playing in to the real time
so, by default you have played every frame, so this would be fine so, here is the playback,
so it will go playing forward and as you can see this speed has increased
and it will go backward and after that it will go frame by frame, one by one clicking,
and after that it will go frame by frame by backward, one by one clicking
and this will allow you to move forward and this will allow you to move backward, so,
it will update slowly and as compared to this one so, now because its running into
free if we and it’s running into real time, and you have jumped to the last and jumped to the
first so, these are the basic basic parameters of your playing button into your timeline
now you can see its position changes, then what you have to do you just select this
and now what we will do we will go in detail into the next session about your timeline and the
some amount of controllers because, here also we have some amount of controllers,
and especially we have one more thing which is called display key ticks and all so, we will just
file and go to modify and here you have freeze transform if you click the freeze transform, all
the coordinate system of our box will change to zero as you can see here if i click now all the
﻿hello everyone so, welcome to this course so i have modeled this
should have one more contrasting part that means that would be much more focused and like this
so, as you can see here also so this would be the contrasting part as it is falling down here
and after that here so, that’s the contrasting part, so you have to examine your contrasting
part so that’s the contrasting part that means if you are working in contrasting part it would
be in this center that means each and every body have of a character or even everything
if you are working in animal also, the front facing part which is this side and this side so
this would have the first look and after that the whole body you can look at that means your
eye will go in this part so you have to define that part so, i have couples of more references
as you can see that would be a good example this leg, especially this leg is the main
source after that we’ll see the hand part so, each and every figure has its own you can say
and after that i have just do the rigging so, in this session we will do the posing inside
the main contrasting feature or the main contrasting part that means your eye will
go directly over here so, in this you have see this would be the part and here this is the,
here this one, here this one, so your eye will first go and one more thing if this part
only one part there could be <?>two or</?> more contrasting part as we can see over here
so, we have taken couples of references and what we will do,
will go to maya and select the references and we will pose at least three type of postures
so, as you can see this is the fight scene, so will take the fight scene from here
as you can see most of the figure, your first view will go to its leg
especially the legs so, like this way you can work and this is also a fight scene
maya application, so let’s start before going to posing you should have reference,
so, will take some amount of fight scene, it doesn’t matter if the anatomy is not matching
to your model, it doesn’t matter what you have to see the joint, especially the joints if you
know how to just manage the joints and all you can easily work
as you can see this is the joint this would be the bone and it’s slightly go over there, this would
be the pelvis and there would be the leg there would be the joint like this you can follow
so, it doesn’t matter that your anatomy is not matching to your model, so
we shall start the work now, what i will do, i will take the reference of any of them
and we’ll start working on the same so, at first i will take the simple reference
as you can see most of the references are simple here so, we will start from simple and we’ll go
so i have taken some references as you can see here so, i will pose like this and
to the most complicated one like this so, let’s continue, what i will do i will
minimize the photoshop and we’ll go to the pose reference and what i will do, i will just select
this and we’ll go to maya and what i will do one more thing is that i have to go to the
front and we’ll go to polygon and just create the plane so just for reference i am taking it
so, plane has been created because the interactive selection is off, i will rotate it by ninety,
we’ll put ninety and after that we don’t required these amount of segments
so, will go to inputs and here you have the segments like ten, ten so i will just have only
one because we only have to just set this for reference purpose and we’ll decrease the size
so i will just not follow the exact dimensions of it because i just need the image to be over here
and just do by looking at the reference so, what we will do right click go to assign new material
if you see the anatomy, if i go to brush and if you see the anatomy here you have the body
and here you have the lambert and in lambert if you go to attribute you have the lambert here
here you have the color so as we have discussed earlier in texturing classes,
if you click over here now, you have the another node which is called create rendered node,
so now you have the file feature, click over here now it change to file attributes,
file one and inside it you have the image name and here you have the folder, click over here and what
you will get, we will get the dialogue box which will just direct you to go to your reference and
just select that particular reference one so, i think we have just set it in,
we have saved it if you select you can see the reference over here, just open now, it’s not
showing so, to see the reference, to see the texture which is basically a texture press six,
now it’s showing here and that’s good, it’s not showing in the perspective so what we will do,
which is you can say it is quit slider and also you have to define the most as you
will press six and now it’s showing so, this would be the reference so what i will do,
i will just rename this ‘r e f’ ref and all the things are there in my particular group
as you can see here we have the model as well as the connectors which is this part,
you can say the curve parts which is over here you can made it from here as we have discussed
in rigging sections so, now i will turn this off, we don’t require the outliner because
we will work in the poses and we’ll select any of the poses so
let’s start this is one of the most simple so, as you have to look at your pose at first and
what you will have to do, just go to the perspective and just select the file like if you
can say the most contrasting part of the body as you can see this hand is one of
so, at first i will select the simple or you can say the <?>rick</?> the simple cut so at first i
will select the simple reference, so this would be the simple reference and you can work in the same
so, what we will do or you also work in that particular so i will just select the section
of the controllers and just move like this and after that we’ll select these controllers
be like that and it will be like that little bit of and now we have to work in the fingers
so, this would be like this, so you have to just look at the reference and just
that means you have to work by looking at your reference and just work for the same
the most contrasting part and if you look at the anatomy and one more thing is that in every part
now, it is little bit of tilted so i will select this we’ll tilt this like and this
we’ll also do the same
just select each and every joint, just move while looking at your reference
make sure that it will not overlap like this so what i will do just control z
or if you are in mac should press shift z and after that,
as you can see all the images it has some contrasting part as this is the t form
and this hand belongs to that contrasting part same for this and this leg so each and every part
hello everyone
will be smaller and we will find difficulty to manage
so, i will just close from here or also you can go to window and just work here because
if you are comfortable then you can work from here
so, now what i will do, i will go to panel and i will just go to the panel and here you
have the graph editor where is it, here you can find
so, now its change and if you want to go to your previous panel how you can just right
space bar, right mouse button and you can go to any of your view so that’s very easy
if you want to drag your view you can drag
now, i will not require <?>mays</?> another view
so, i will just put like here and we’ll change the panel and will go to a graph editor
see we are in front view and what we will do
and now if you select your ball what you are getting, you are getting two translation
as you can see the ball starts from its initial position which is one and if it <?>goes</?>
as you found that in fifteen frame we have the key so we have to manage this key particularly
this one
you can just zoom it according to your need
so, if you want to zoom you can also zoom by scroll so like this way so what i will
do if you select the key if you move forward
as you can see it’s going up if you select this key which is here and go downward see
it will update
so, we’ll move little bit like here and we’ll make a new box and just click this
so, control z or as your the curve will also be like tipped and ball will <?>follow</?>
so, we will select that particular section and here you can see its showing the white
part between the two vertex or you can say the two key frame so what we will do, here
you have break tangent click over here now you can easily break
so, what happen see, if i just make the curve like this as you can say this is an inorganic
thing, so you have to make like heart, heart structure or heart shape inside your tangent
and inside your graph editor
so, break the tangent over here also as you can see what happens next
here we haven’t updated the same so will update but at first let’s check is it working
or not, as you can see its now getting tipped, here you can found its getting tipped
box and move it somehow here, we’ll increase it size and we’ll increase size like this
but after that it’s behaving like yeah weird
it’s quite behaving weird here because we haven’t change this so what we will do,
we’ll pause this for a time and we’ll go up to here and we’ll change this particular
section, we’ll break a tangent and we’ll move further
possible to tell each and every thing, each and every panel
so, you have to keep on experimenting things
if this would be possible you can do it but these are very simple as you know that each
and every thing will be applied on your particular vertex and to break your or to attach your
or to change your tangent point into the key frame which is also called vertex and graph
and we’ll keep it like here
editor
so, you have to just experiment the same, now as you can see your ball is behaving better
as compared to the early
so, here we have high velocity so what i will do, i will just select this point
and you can decrease this little bit as you can move from holding your middle mouse button
i will do control z, control z
if you want to move any of the tangent points or any of the vertex or any of the key frame
you have to select it
and by holding your middle mouse button which is also known as scroll button
you can just click and you can move easily
so, now as you can see our box and ball both are formed and i will just keep this ball
so, that’s the main thing and select this tangent we’ll move like here
so, as you can see i just press the space bar, its forming so irregular shape so what
we will do just click on the move middle mouse button and just move little bit
so, that our slope will be quite fine
you can see your view has been highlighted as there is a light greyish color line and
if you select this your view will be highlighted
so, if you select your ball and just press in this view you can update and you can see
the updates also but if you press here and just click it over here ok you can’t see
and press f for focusing your object and you will just keep over here
the updates and also you will find some much more difficulty
so, that’s the main thing you have to just keep the select ball and after that just go
to here and just play forward or play backward
so, now one more thing is that i will just call all my views here and will update this
laterwards
so, i will just press space bar, right click hold your right click, go to perspective so
here you have the bouncing ball and now you can have a look at how a concrete ball bounce,
how a rubber ball bounce, how a plastic ball bounce and or how a if the ball is iron how
it get bounce?
so, you have to just see the videos and just work for the same
okay
so, reference is very important if you have reference you can work quite well
because live example is very important in the field of animation, in every field especially
in modelling, texturing, lighting, rigging, motion and dynamics
so, if you have the reference that would be better and one more thing if you go to your
timeline, here you have the timeline
and right click, by right click you have one thing is that play blast
so, rather than clicking over here you can go to here which is the setting and what play
blast does, play blast will just generate a video clip and will show you that means
if your file gets buffered then it will just produce a small video clip and will show to
you
make sure that you will not collapse if i press four you can see now it’s getting
so, make sure that your encoding will be in h point two sixty-four, which is a video version
so we don’t require jpg image sequence
so, h point two sixty-four as you can required you can use it but for now i am using h point
two sixty-four and also the size of the video so we don’t required it right now
you can scale it or even you can have frame padding, what is frame padding?
that means it is of around four
so, it will just generate and also have the auto backup after every four frames, so frame
padding is there if you want to decrease you can decrease, so i will just put around two
so, click on the play blast and now you have the particular view, all the view has of and
collapse from here and it is not good so you should just put it over here somehow over
so now you have the video file, you can just check it over here
short out it
and so i will off this and we’ll just go here and what i will do, just select this
part again and will go to the graph editor and will change
so, select this part and you should go to graph editor to change and to have a good result
here
so, in this session we will learn about the bouncing ball and also we will learn few of
you press five and here is your ball
so, if you are dragging something on your viewport you find that all the things, all
the parameters will change that means you have to just freeze all the parameters which
you have worked
the freeze transform, so what it does, it will just put all the value zero and only
scale value would be one
so, freeze transform now all the value is zero i will select both of them, modify freeze
transform
now, one more thing is that, okay what i will do, i will go to the front view
the things which we have discussed earlier about timeline
so, here you have the ground so i will make a new box again and will make the ground as
you can just drag like here
press four as you can see its lying on the grid and will modify freeze transform we will
not animate this part, we’ll animate only the ball
so, what i will do, i will just go to five and will select the ball and i will just save
my file, at first we have to just save the file so bouncing, bouncing ball underscore
zero zero one, always make version that would be fine if something happened you can directly
go to your previous version and just correct the same
so, now we have the scene all the transformation is zero
so, we will discuss in details about the timeline and also about the bouncing ball
now, what you have to do just select and if you want to just give translation value only
you can do it well but i will just on all the thing because i have to just work with
scale or rotation if i need it further
so, what i will do i will just press s button make sure that you are in one frame and how
you can increase the timeline
so, here by default which is one twenty, as you can see if you just drag this particular
section you can just have the timeline which is around two hundred so you can zoom this
like, so it will zoom
so, after one frame, two frame will came, three frame will came, like this way
so, you can just drag if you want to increase the timeline number that means the duration
so, let’s continue, now what i will do, i will just go to polygon and here you have
of timeline, just click over here
if you need five hundred just press five hundred enter so it will convert into five hundred
so, like this way if you are in one eighty-six frame click over here you can go to that particular
frame
so, i am in <?>two nineteen</?> frame so i will just zoom this like this way
you can zoom and just focus inside the frame, it will just zoom it, okay so by default which
is two hundred
so, i will make two hundred so we’ll enter it and one more thing, one more thing is that
here you have the auto key, so we’ll on the auto key because if you are not using
the auto key each and every frame you have to go and just press this s button on your
ball
keyboard so that it will update or i will just put the animation key on that particular
frame
so, we will not use it, we will use the auto key, at first i will just press s, s button
on your keyboard as you can see the thing has been animated in first frame and all the
translation, rotation and scale value has been animated
now, what i will do, i will just on the auto key and now i don’t have to press s all
three blocks of <?>capness</?> as you can see between one to five there would be two,
three, four so we’ll take three block
as you can see these are the blocks we’ll take three blocks of times and we’ll just
so, if you click the ball and what happens it will just form on your grid so you just
jump like here and will move further in twenty-five frames it will go down
here always just put it over here
okay
so, one, two, three and we have four so i have two blocks here and we’ll just put
ball gets down as it move forward and after that some time it will just stop
two, three, we’ll go here, we’ll go, we’ll go here and we’ll just keep the ball and
put it over here okay
we’ll go further, i will go further
so, i will increase the size i think we have to just shift this forward <?>refine</?> so
as you can see we have the bouncing ball so if i play
it’s not looking natural so what we have to do, we have select this and we’ll go
to one sixty frame and will put one sixty
so, after that it will just follow the loop so it’s not looking natural as you can see
it’s not acting natural, it’s not looking natural so what we will do as you in perspective
and for a time we’ll turn off the grid so what i will do, i will just select my ball
and we’ll go to any of the view i think perspective press space bar and right mouse
button hold your right mouse button so as you can see you can change your view so i
now, i will go to my side view this would be fine and we’ll move, we’ll go to front
will go to front view
okay
so, here is the front view so i need some more space so i will just off this view by
dragging it and will off this view also by dragging it and after that we don’t required
this side view here what we will do, we will go to panel and in panel you have the panel
and in panel you have the graph editor
you can also open through a window animation editor and here you have the graph editor
but it will float like this
so, we don’t require to float because we need to fix its position
either you can just drag like here but that would not work properly because all the section
i think front is fine
hello everyone
go to the attribute editor for your experimentation and all, for a good result
so, it’s very important
now, i just selected the nparticles, have gone in the attribute editor, so here we have
the nparticles shape one which is by default open
so, here we have a particular panel called collisions
that means it’s get collide with each other
so, collide, we have self collide here
so, we will on the self collision
if i press play, what happens see?
the particles getting collided with each other as we can’t see here but we will see next
inside maya
we have the create panel
rather than dragging here, what i will do, i will just go to create and here we have
the polygon primitives
so, i will off the interactive creation and what happens, it will directly create a box
so, i will just create a box which is a cube and as you can see, it’s created over here
i will press four, as you can see here, i will just off the grid by here
now, if i focus in this part, i need the box to be small
so, we have two box, the p plane one, sorry, the p plane cube is one is the wall and the
p cube two is the small box here
so, you don’t have to download it separately
press four, press five and press six, go to your smooth view
one
thing is that instance replacement okay
so, we will just click over here and what we are getting, let’s see
as you can see, all the boxes getting ejected out
now, our scene is getting heavy
so, i think we have to change the size of the box because we need more small
so, just go over it
as you can see, these are the boxes which we have created
i will go here
editor and will go to emitter one and in basic emitter attributes, i will just off this emitter
system
so, when it’s hit the wall, it will <?>become</?> back
now, it would be zero and set key
so, let’s check
you found all the panels you can go to nparticle, humanik, mocap
we need more couple of adjustment here
is getting lost, because we have been animated this particular key in between them
so, fifteen thousand from here to this one is getting zero and
set key
this would be fine
one and will go to the attribute editor and here we have the nparticle shape one
we have work it many times here
so, i had a emission panel, so let’s check
so, we will focus on motion capture which is mocap
emission attributes, okay
so, i will open this panel and here we have inherit factor
so, here is the inherit factor
so, i will just <?>grab</?> this little bit i think
two forty it is fine, let’s see
so, i will go to window, and here you have a good feature and called playblast
so, it will cache up your memory and just generate a video clip
so, i will go to first frame, window and playblast
let’s cache the thing and they will produce a video clip of that thing
so, let’s have a look
so, i may have the run, run motion capture
so, as you can see, it’s collapsing on the wall and will go to the first frame
now, as you have seen, it’s collapsing quite well
now, what i will do, i will just click on nparticles as have a look, is it the particle
is selected or not
so, i think the particle is selected
which is the rotation
here you have the instancer geometry replacement
so, i will just click the data, press middle mouse button and drag into my viewport
so, i think these are fine
so, here we have the rotation option
so, in rotation option, here we have the rotation and so here we have the rotation pp
so, will change this
let’s check is it fine or not
instancer geometry replacement, inside instancer geometry replacement, there is the rotation
option inside it
here we have the rotation panel, so we have to check only rotation panel
so, it will add random rotation axis into the particles, so i will go to rotation pp,
click over here
now, it’s been applied to the viewport
select the character
okay, so, i will go to channel box
now, this is also important term and because we have to hide this character
okay
and will press s
as you can go to paints effects, you found all the things which you needed
animations_7784
right now because we have use it earlier and we have outliner which is open by default
we have open it earlier
and now, what we will do, will select the emitter one and will go to graph editor
so, how you can go, is going to window, by going to window and here you have the animation
editor and inside it you have the graph editor
so, it’s a very complicated but it’s not so complicated at its look like
we have so much more panels
we will discuss in animation but not in this topic
these are the presets inside maya software
so, in this session we will make character particle dispersion
we will use some sort of tweakness only okay
animations_7797
so now, i will select the emitter and we have to just tweak it into graph editor
so, what i will do, i will go to window and here you have the animation editor and here
you have the graph editor
if you click the graph editor, you see nothing
but, if you zoom out by scroll, you see a tangent like this
so, we have to adjust it right now
so, what i will do, i will just select this particular <?>follow</?> and will move further,
so, will not focus in this, we will just focus on the motion capture
let’s have a look
no problem
so, we will move, control z, move this little, sorry, we just have to minimize, maximize
now, you can turn this thing but we are not doing here because we have adjustment here so,
to graph editor again
so, we will go to visibility
so, i just created this part by clicking over here
just put it over here
let’s check
now, it’s showing, okay
so, i will press four
press five so you can see the character
nucleus, if you don’t want to see its structure and all but you can see here, the hands are
going like
so, as you can see, if i zoom, the particles, the size of the motion human is very high
okay
here you have the character now
so, that would be a problem
so, what i will do, pause this for a while
and because we have on it visibility, if you off the same, it will follow its shape
so, that would be a plus point
think this would be fine
now, it’s ok
so, what i will do, i will just scale this down and press f for focus
it’s getting splashed
let’s see
as you can see it’s producing the particles
so, like this way, you can tweak your object if you want any powered like thing and you
can tweak through emitter, by going to, you can say by going to a graph editor
now, you can tweak, you have all the things here, so one by one you just have to do the
modification and it will generate different result
so, i think this would be fine
hang up so, as you can see, at first just produce the power and then it will move
so, like effects and all, if the character is getting angry and it is producing the power
and will run through the same, you can also work like that and for that what you have
to do?
nothing, just make sure that you will select the emitter and will go to a graph editor
which is here and will just turn both of them shift by shift so,
we have just selected the emitter
if you shift the top part, that means the front part, the first part, this one, if you
shift the first part then it will just produce the power and then move
if you select this part and move to the back, what happens?
so, i am just selected the controller
it will just still in stand position and it will just generate the power after going at
as you can see, it’s generating the power
so, so now you have the idea, how you can create or modify things and just have to do
in the different terms and all into graph editor
so, you have all the idea that how you can manipulate the things, how you can change
if you change this what happens?
all the particles is going up and then the character will move and see the particles
is left behind
now, what i will do, i will go to a plane and will create a plane
so, like this way you can tweak and have a good result
so, you have to work in the graph editor
that means just select this point, move forward and see the result, select this point, move
forward, see the result
if you want to move it forward, just see the result what happens next
so, you have to do a couples of adjustment, like this and if you just drag this down,
what happens, just see
so, you need a lots of experiment
okay
so, you need a lots of experiment and you also have to work with the character skin,
so, this would be the plane, press six
go to your this particular part and here you have the small point which is its property
features
so, you can change by middle mouse button by going up and up and going here and here
so, it will just animate its visibility if you need more freedom
from here you can go to graph editor and just have the tangent and all and you can animate
the same
so, like this way you can add extra things according to your need
and it’s all depend on you
so, it is all on you
so, you can just adjust its timeline and you can make certain key frames for more animation
as you can see, if i go to hundred frames and now it start running and will hit to the
so, you have all the features as you can see, when it start it’s generating the particles
because we have shifted the you can say, its timeline here
okay so, like this way, you may have the modification, select this part, move up here
let’s see what happens
select this part, move up here, let’s see what happens, control z and let’s check
the result
so, you will get all the things
as you can see, it haven’t generated the particles and because we have move so much
forward and if you move this backward, let’s see what happens
now, little bit of particles has been generated
surface
so, let’s continue
like this way you can work
one more thing, in this tutorial, you have to examine because we have told you the each
and every parts of this tutorial, each and every panels
so, you have to experiment one more thing, if you have just created the character and
the particles and the box and the plane, how you can just eliminate these particles, so
that it will not show up here
so, you can do it
well, you have all the parameters known, so you can do it this thing
this is very simple
okay
when this is at the back
this two points when at the back, control z, sorry, the character has generated the
kind of particles and just move forward or when this is at the front, so we have a gap
between them
so, after that the character run, few frames, then the particles have generated
so, you can have the experiment
only two things you have to do, first select the skin, just move it
you have the points here, experiment the same
make playblast through window and just experiment it and after that you just have to select
the emitters
let’s start to work in this
then you have the curve which is situated over here
so, let’s have a practice
attribute editor is very important as we have discussed many times that you have to go through
the panels and all
if you want to change the colour of the character and the particles, you can do it well
i think orangish is fine okay
animations_7937
there should be a little bit of transparency
now, what i will do, i will just go to box, make a box, click and the man will hit to
ambient colour should be hide
go to assign new material, so for examine i just put that particular colour
you can put it according to your needs
okay, now you can change the colour of your character
but, i don’t think so i can change over here because i don’t need it
so, let’s have a look
so, you can change the colour of the character and the particles, but i don’t think so
the box, and will start getting dispersed
i need in this part
so, now you have the idea how you can change each and every thing, one by one, step by step
so,
you can do it well
you have to go to the panel of attribute editor and all
after that you can do the experiment
so, that would be fine
i want you to just compose this shot or like same
you can compose it, render the same, okay
as you can see, here we have the particles, which we have just click over here
so, i will just put the box over here
it’s rendered that particular image
now, you have the idea and make sure that whenever you are working, you should save
your file
so, ascii is fine, enter
so, you can change the colour, you can change the character colour or you can even put the
texture
you know how to rig, how to animate, so you can also apply on your own model
that would be fine
let’s see is it touching it or not
you can just make the wall more heavier by including the texture, putting some bump map
or even displacement map
just put some environment at the back
just give the lights
you know the ambient light, you know the three point lighting
you know the indirect base or image base lighting
so, you can just put each and everything one by one and compose the whole shot
so, that would be much more fine for you
so, let’s meet to the next session
yeah, it is touching
i think this is fine
okay now, what i will do, i will just select the box and will on the ndynamics because
we will focus on nucleus dynamics
so, what i will make in this session, a character will run across the road and it will just
so, will go to ndynamics and what i will do, i will go to nmesh and here you have the passive
collider, create passive collider
so, will same do with the ground also
nmesh, create passive collider
we will go to show and here we have the joints, so i don’t need the joints now
so, i will off this thing and each and everything is fine, each and everything is opened, so
i don’t need the joint, because if i select the model, by default or by chance it can
select the joints also
so, that would be problem if something happened with joint, all the animation will be gone
hit the wall and will turn into particles
so, make sure that you just off the joint i am going to show and you have the joint
system here
just off it
and after that, i will go to window and here we have the outliner
so, i will just on the outliner and will select the run, skin
and now what i will do, i will go to nparticles, here you have the nparticle panel and will
emit from object
so, when i click into the panel, emitter is fine
emitter type, this is very important
so, we will start making it
so, we need the surface emitter
so, i will put zero and will go to surface and rest is fine
so, when you apply, as you can see, this is the particular thing and here it’s forming
the emitter
okay so, will close the same and if i check what we are getting here let’s see
nothing, no problem
we will work on this
so, i will just select the emitter and will go to attribute editor and here we have the
emitter panel
before making, i will just go to perspective and here we will go to window
and in emitter panel, what i will do, i will go to basic emitter attributes
so, this is the basic emitter attributes, as you can see, this is the basic parameter
property features of emitter
so, in basic emitter attributes, i have rate particle per second
so, now, it’s time to us to animate it
so, i will just put somehow over here, okay
okay, will select this part, right click, set key
if you set the key, there would be a red line here
that means, this particular frame has been animated by you
so, in window, here you have many things
i will take around fifteen thousand ten thousand
okay now, right click, set key
as you can see, now it’s showing that it’s generating the particles, okay so,
the nucleus
here you have the nucleus and in nucleus, here you go to the attribute editor which
is open by default because i have just worked in the particles
if you go to general editor, here you found all the things but we will focus on visors
so, here you have the gravity and wind and what i will do, i will just change the gravity
so, here you have the gravity by nine point eight
as you can see, some of the particles getting up, no problem
and now, i will select the nparticles, so here you have the nparticles which is the
particle source and will go to attribute editor again because attribute editor is very important
each and everything what you have to manage, you have to go to attribute editor and do
the couples of adjustment for your own need and after that you will get the results
so, attribute editor is very important in each case
if you are doing modeling, texturing, lighting, animation, rigging, dynamics, you have to
so, you can have every presets plugins in visors it’s a stock preset plugin present
﻿hello everyone and welcome to this session of maya two thousand fourteen so in this
just go to the attribute editor and do whatever you want to do or animate the same so inside hair
system shape you will get all the things like clamp, main thing is that and you can increase
or decrease the values like just select and just decrease the values if you decrease or increase
so like this way you can work for the same
now it depends on you that how much you are doing the same, you can also just select this
and go to the lambert click over here and also you can change the
value of the clumpness on your model you can have good result ok, as you can see it is so
high and also the render time will take because as the value get increased so like this way
definitely the fur has its own name because this is a bear furs, so the bear fur is being written
but we don’t require this amount, we’ll definitely decrease the value ok,
display quality would be fine, hair per clump will be low
like this way you can animate, if you just want to animate,
animate the same of the grid select this n seventy-four point x is going upward,
n hundred <?></?> downward, let’s have a look
you can use the fur you can use the n hair, n stands for nucleus so how you can manually
just put the hair on a model with the help of curve specially the epi curve tool we will
discuss in next class so hope you understand the same, let’s switch to the next class
over there if now you just rendered the same, what you will get let’s see,
as you can see the fur is all over the model and now what happens next just go
here and just have the preset, you can get the bison, you can the dreadlocks,
duckling, gorilla and all the things which is coming across here, you have the color you can
change the color from here, if you need to change the color definitely you can work for the same
so if you just have a look definitely the color will change and we will get a greenish color
so the base ambience color all the things are depend on here, you can change from here or you
can just have a look at how it is looking or not, as you can see the fur is increasing quite bit
you can just have a look so the fur inside maya you don’t have to just do a lot of modifications,
session we will learn about the fur which is present inside maya,
just only have a few tweaking so that it will just wrap up on you whole model ok
now if you just decrease the size definitely it will decrease, if you just decrease the length
definitely it will decrease the length as you can see if i just have a look
at the render definitely we’ll see some sort of changes if we increase the length
definitely it will produce a huge amount of fur so fur is basically if you have a whole model you
can just apply the fur on that particular model as you can see its taking some time to render
like this way because each and every fur
which is creating here it has some sort of texture which is just contracting over default light,
so it will calculate huge amount of time so that’s the thing so i just decrease the size,ok,
and here we have the length and here we have the bottleness we increase definitely the quantity
so let’s get started as you can see here we have the fur panel but fur will only
of the hair will increase it is the roll, if you want to roll it you can roll it, the polar if you
want to change the direction of the fur ok,this is the tip opacity, this is the tip
width and all the things which is come across the fur this is the clumping and all ok,
so beside fur there is n hair we don’t require right now n hair you can just paint n hair if
you need to paint over the fur, we don’t require n hair right now, i will just have to decrease the
fur clump shape if you just have like this and all the things which comes across here
so you can change from here you can change you have the n hair you can have all the things which
is come across the hair and also you can use the fur so fur is basically for animal or you can
use in the hand or the leg the small hairs you can’t do so much of modification with the fur
select this just go to the fur and just we have three features which is the fur
apply into the polygon for any of the spline so for rough purpose i just using a sphere
feedback and the fur feedback shape and normal fur shape
segments is very important, if you just decrease the segment only line can be seen
if you just increase this segment the you can say the curviness can be seen on your screen
this is the offset value if you want to just increase the value, if you want to
increase the value definitely you can work for the offset so like this way you can work
so we need segment we have increased the segment, we have detail, you have base color if you need to
change the base color you can work for the same, you have the noise
and also we have many more features inside you just keep on dragging and just see
is it working or not like this, many more things you can just change from here, just
have a look that how you can change so this is the basic tutorial cut so this is the basic
so here is the sphere if i go to the renders setting, sorry we don’t required the render
video that you have the understanding of how this thing used inside maya software and,
ok, here you have the map width and map height and here you have the base
so if you are satisfied with your result you can bake the same right now i am not baking and
there are more features you can just use this right now i am just deleting this
and if you have some shape like if i just use this sphere and
just for rough purpose i am just painting some of the vertexes i think face would be fine
i am just painting some of the face ok, this is only for rough purpose
and just delete the same suppose this is the back of the head, you
can use the fur from here click over the fur click at first select the whole model and use the fur
and after that using the fur you just see your, enter view that what the result you are
setting, we can directly render the same we’ll get nothing only the sphere but if we
getting you are getting like this so if i just right click and right click assign new material
lambert in lambert i have just changed the color so that will match or you can also use some
amount of bit map into the lambert image file so that it will look so much more natural to you
just have the render let’s see as you can see, you can use the… ok,now select this fur as this is the
deadlock fur you can have the same feature which is present inside the bear
you can have the base color ok, by default i am giving this and you have the length,
shorter length or you have the clump and all which is in seen by you, you can see
so you can animate this right click right click right side key and just increasing the value of
you can say just going to forward of the timeline i just going to the backward of the timeline,
check the auto key you can animate history ok,for it while i will just off the grid because it’s at
just select this sphere and just go to the fur and here you have the fur features which is
the center at just we don’t require the grid right now we have the clump and all just have a look
at you can also make some amount of beard or mustache with the help of this
fur make sure that whenever you working you just have to select that particular section
and after that you can apply the same otherwise it will apply on your own model, ok,
moving it up and edit delete by type history we don’t require the history select and so
here we have the n hair, so this is the n hair create n hair create n hair option
click and you have the beat effects create and u count if you increase the u count definitely
that amount of hair will produce right now i am using twenty,
just click as you can see the process has done and it is just forming the twenty
present inside this but at first i will just go to the edit and delete by type history so that
and now i am just increasing the timeline by two hundred or you can three hundred enter and if
we just play the button definitely the hair will fall as you can see the hair will fall and also
stop it and just see the timeline what you will get definitely you will get this
so if you are not satisfied with the hair you can also use to paint some of the hairs like this
ok,so that would be much more fine and just go to the first frame and just all the things
here you have the all the features which is come across, the clamp and all increase the value
segments, thinning and lamberts we increase the value definitely
it will capture the main moto for the hair is that if you working in hair
you have to select that particular part then the hair will form which looks good ok,
it’s the history which is forming over the channel box or attribute editor it will all erase up
otherwise it will just wrap into whole model right now it has done the same so if i just play
as the simulation is very high because we have increase the value and also the quantity of the
hair, that’s why the simulation is very, very high as you can see just pause for a while and
select the hair just go to the attribute and just decrease the hairs
and as thirty frames is going over here press s what happens see
clump width and all it will just cover the whole area, right now i'm not in increasing because
definitely the system will get hang up you got the points and if you want to do some random
modification definitely you have to go to the attribute editor select that particular thing
i just select this and make sure that you just click only one time and a fur will generate
﻿hello everyone and welcome to this course of maya two thousand eighteen arnold,
so in the next session we will just learn more about this light and more about this settings,
okay but first i wanna show one more thing is that when just you render the same
okay as you can see we have rendered the same so here we have a setting bar,
click over the setting bar you will get the gamma and the gain which is the exposure
so you can change the exposure from here it will effect your scene definitely it will
produce more dramatic result so here we have the exposure and gamma value, we just rotate the model
definitely it will update on your scene so you can change from here to have a look and also here
if i go to the render settings, we have the camera aa diffuse specular and transmitter
and sub-surface scatter volume indirect so increasing the camera aa value will let you
smoother result, so in the next session we will just use this, use the camera aa value and also
so we just putted the model into smaller size in between the grid and now we’ll just select
we’ll use the sub-section-surface scattering because both will work same and also both have
the good correlation with each other so specularity if you need more shininess you
can increase the specularity which is present inside this and you have the diffuse also
so and the transmission like his way you can change and also you have to go through
many various properties from the attribute editor, so in next session we’ll looking all
the property features of the attribute editor of arnold inside maya software
so i think this part has been captured by you because it’s a very simple and you know the basic
fundamentals of arnold which we have learned in this session you can just use the same thing on
the model and here we have the render setting, so in render setting we are use to change the
render using arnold, by default maya software will be there because maya software is by
default and you can change to arnold so, all the panels will be changed, you have arnold
renderers system aovs, diagnostic and common so maximum time we will use this arnold render
especially in sampling because we have camera aa diffuse specular transmission, sub surface
scattering and volume indirect so what are these values we will discuss this in later wards
i will just cut this off and if i don’t render the same, so i am rendering it from here
so you can see its forming nothing because as we have not using the arnold
shader because we are in arnold render engine so we have to use the shaders
so in this session we will understand the arnold process inside maya software
so i will just select the whole model and now what i will do right click and here you have the
assign new material so in assign new material you have the arnold shader so, i go to shader
and here you have the all the shader which comes around arnold so we will discuss the
shader later wards but at first this is one of the most basic shader which arnold have
which is aistandardsurface, you can change any of the property shader through this shaders
so i am just using the shader as when the shader is been implemented all the features
has been came on the attribute editor right side of your screen so we are not changing anything
right now we will change it later ward but not right now we’ll just put the colors somehow into
little bit of greyish like nature and you have the weight you can increase or decrease the quantity
so let’s get started as you can see that we have imported a model and this doesn’t have any
render settings so what i will do let’s change the color little bit of it and also as you can see
we’ll just do one more thing here we have the arnold panel so i will just click over here,
you have the interactive render view if i just click over here whatever you do
the changes it will update on you view screen so right now it’s now showing
no problem right click, assign new material again and shader aistandardsurface
and so for a quick examine purpose let’s just start on this
it not showing no problem we’ll show this into few minutes so here we have some of the lights which
arnold have so i am just forming the area light if i just click and just drag it over here
just select this light and if i just go to the setting as you can see your model can be seen
decrease the value you rotate definitely your render view will also update
texture so right now what we will do, we will do the arnold render engine and also we’ll understand
so if you rotate definitely your view will rotate, if you just off this nothing will be happen
so this is very good in arnold as you can see small grains forming on your model because this
is due to the camera aa value which is set into three if you increase this value definitely your
render would be so much of more smoother and also it will take some time so maximum value you can
put to eight to ten okay not more than that otherwise it will hang up your whole scene
if you have a good pc configuration then it would be okay, otherwise
you can use eight nine okay so no problem right now i will just off this if i just form a ground,
so i just form a ground i just select this light, move it somehow here as you can see let’s select
this ground right click assign new material arnold here we have the aistandardsurface,
let’s have a look if the reflection is coming on the ground, we don’t have to
few of the property features of arnold so at first i will just select all the model and
render in this view, you can render but right now i am not using i am just avoiding it
and we just go to the arnold tab and here you have the interactive render settings click over here
you can see the model is showing here also it has some sort of shadow
when model is in the air because there is no any contact between the
ground and the model so i just put the ground to be somehow like this as you can
see light is bouncing quite well so if you want to change the color definitely you can
just have to go to attribute editor here we have the color so you can change
the color according to your need so just change the color and you can select the slide,
you have all the features like having the mental ray all you can just have all the features like
intensity and all so instead of increasing the intensity i will just duplicate the slide
just go to edit and here we are into delete by type history so all the history will be erased
move it somehow here you press seven you can see the light inside the arnold
so at first you are in six, if you press seven definitely you can see the light
no problem so i will just rotate the slide little bit like this way you just put it somehow here
and change the color of the light no problem definitely you can do anything inside maya
software so it’s just zoom in the character and just see is it working quite well or not
as the intensity of the light is very low this is not showing properly,
if you see the reflection of the blue light is forming just below the over there okay
just select the light and increase the intensity if you want to increase
definitely you can click over here and just click intensity would be ten let’s have a look
is it working well or not as you can see now you can see the proper texture of the model
and the model is between the grid and make sure that the model is in you can say low
and you can also see the reflection of the light which is forming at your model if you just rotate
this, you will find the blue bounciness which is forming on your model okay
as you can see here and the background is darker because nothing is doing there in the background
and also the light getting fade off because arnold blend smoothly inside your software so
that means if you have to change the each and every part definitely you can select this part
right click go to assign new material and you have the aistandardsurface you can change the color
from here or even one more thing is there you can use any the image file or any of the bitmap file
which is present inside create node tab okay i like that of the mental ray version
and as you can see body is combined in one no problem right click assign new material
so now i am not focusing in all of them i am just focusing the aistandardsurface you
in size because if you increase the size definitely it will take the huge amount of
can change the preset from here you have the preset, you can change the preset
if you need glass you can just have the glass or just if you need the frosted glass, clay, chrome,
anything if you want to need definitely you can change from there okay no problem
just have a look what kind of texturing is formed here as you can see the glass we have just change
the preset of the aistandardsurface to glass and it showing the glassiness of your model so
it is quite little bit of naturality as you can see we haven’t use any kind of
different thing we have use only the arnold few modifications and also two light with
low intensity so we haven’t modified the same we just used and just putted on the scene
so as you can see its working quite well and also the reflection properties are
quite natural and okay if you need to do some amount of modification with the attribute editor
render time so if you can decrease the model size definitely your scene will be lighter
definitely your result would be so much of good i am skipping this and just closing this,
select this and just go to the aistandardsurface, you just go over there all the presets have
you can say the inbuilt property if you change the preset just using the bubble,
all the property will be change, definitely yes
this would happen you can change the color from here right now i’m not using the color
as you can see it has been implemented on your model so like this way
if you want to add some amount of texture definitely like in mental ray you can also just
select that part go to color click over here and just put any of the texture if you want to put
definitely you can so it depends on you what type of things you need to do okay
so as you can see we have just use two arnold lights and one simple material into the scene
and also your model which you are making or just forming inside maya it is a vector
﻿hello and welcome back to the animation course on swayam platform in this session,
it is an art that is often display and celebrated in the film festival all over the world
it is also used commonly for educational purpose as it has a big place in the learning and
instructional application to really understand the size of three d animation, you must understand the
mathematics behind it three d animation consists of varying properties of a three dimensional scene
defined in a numeric quantities a three d model can change properties such as position,
rotation, scaling and the surface <?>*</?> an animated three d scene is a defined by the change
of this scientific properties through time we can do the animation with several methodology
some are traditional animation in traditional animation, illustrators draw picture on a
straightforward bit on a paper, fit it on to the light box, utilizing by the color pencils
animators usually test animations with rough drawings to see how many frames they would
we will learn about the production pipeline of three d animation using autodesk maya application
need for the animation the animation process of traditional animation is time
taken and expensive also once the drawings and clean ups and in between frames are completed,
the production would move on to the capturing each individual sketches but, nowadays
traditional animation can be done on a computer pen tablet and it doesn’t require the photography
of each and individual frames there are several application
available into the industry which you can use for the traditional animation purpose for example,
tv paint it is a free animation software second you can use the toon boom harmony
toon boom harmony offer a user friendly set of animation program that has capability for advanced
rigging system, the frames and also camera tools you can use the adobe photoshop also
usually photoshop is often overlooked when considering as an animation software,
animation is a field of art or science that has the capability to impart life to
but it is really powerful drawing capability which makes it a great choice for frame by frame
disney style animation second methodology, you can go with a two d vector based animation
the two d vector based animation is used when referring to the traditional hands on animation
with integration of computer vector animation that adopts the technique of traditional animation
two d vector based animation means the computer generated two d animation it uses the same work
flow as traditional animation but it gives you the benefit from the lack of physical
item needed to make the traditional two d animation with availability to the computer interpolation
to the same time you can use the adobe animate earlier the flash software or toon boom harmony
were two d vector based animation then third option of animation could be
motion graphics motion graphics is a quite different from the other type of animation
non-living characters basically, it is based on the phenomenon on persistence of vision
it is not character or a story driven animation it is the art and the science of creatively moving
and animating the graphics element or text it is usually for visual presentation or a <?>*</?> video
or the commercial advertisement, or it could be used for the promotional purpose also
adobe after effect is the most common software for two d motion graphics
but for three d motion graphics, generally you can use the cinema four d or the autodesk mass application
next animation option could be the stop motion stop motion animation is also referred as the cut
out animation or clay animation stop animation is turned by taking the photo of the object and
the moving just a little bit with a new pose or position and taking another photographs,
then process repeated simultaneously and when the photos playback into the sequence it gives
an illusion of motion called animation and next and most advanced technology is three d
that allows the visual illusion to the objects
computer animation three d computer animation is also refer as a cgi or computer graphics imagery
there is a famous quote by john lasitar, computers doesn’t create the computer animation and
any more than pencil creates pencil animation what creates computer animation is the artist
the animation is completely different than traditional animation
the three d animation require an understanding of the same principle of movement and composition but,
they also require the technical skill while traditional animation require you being an
amazing draftsman but the three d computer animation doesn’t three d animation is more similar to playing
with a puppet rather than a drawing there are a number of other distinct process
that require to produce a computer animation often, this must be accomplished in a specific
order and this is called the pipeline there are three stages of animation production pipeline
so in single line, we can say animation is the illusion of motion three d animation has become a
first is the pre-production, second is the production and third one is the post production
in pre production stage, we do planning about the story, concept, character, the pre-production
team will take its time to make sure to tell an engaging story with interesting characters
so in pre-production stage, our entire planning stage should be executed after completion
of pre-production stage, now it is time to the production stage so in production
stage, we do create the three d elements for movies, games or video there are seven main stages of
animation production pipeline first is the modeling in modeling, we do the
model as per reference which we had created into the pre-production stage so by default,
when we do any model in any three d application, usually its generate into the grey color
after modeling stage, it requires to put some colors onto that model and that is called
vital part in film, television and the video games and it is becoming an integral part of
the texturing in texturing, with the help of uv, what we do, we do wrap a texture into the
model and after completion of texturing, now it is a time to do some light onto the model
so in lighting a stage, there are several lights available
into the three d application usually it is a omni, spot light, fresnel light, point light and all
so with the help of these lights, we create a scene aesthetics look and feel development of
our model so, after completion of modeling and texturing and lighting, now it is a time to do the
bone setup into the model so bone setup is the process, or we can say the rigging is the process
where we do add the bones into the model for the movement of the character when our character bone
setup or the rigging pipeline has been completed, now it is a time to move our character as per the
requirement of movie or the scene so, it is a call the animation
other industry that may not have found it all that useful at first, field such as medicine,
or in a simple term, we can say animation is the illusion of motion any kind of movement,
what we are seeing into the real world or we can say into the television or the computer screen,
it could be part of animation after completion of animation, now it is a time to add some secondary
motion or we can say secondary animation for example, hair and fur, clothes, water
stimulation, fire stimulation and all this are a category of dynamics or affects pipeline
after completion of dynamics, now it is a time to convert entire three d data into image sequence or
into the video form so, with the help of camera available into the three d application,
we convert entire data into the image sequence or into the movie after completion of rendering,
now it is a time to post production stage so in post-production stage,
we do merge the three d elements for the movies, games, videos to the live action footages
architectural and even forensic are now using the three d animation
there are two main stages of animation post production pipeline,
first is the compositing and last one is the editing so in editing stage, finally we do cut
the movie, the footage as per the requirement of the story timeline of the movie now it is time to
get know about the maya history, future and their application using into the industry
so in next session, we will learn about the same
in addition to use for entertainment purpose, it is considered as a form of art
﻿in this second module of animation, you will learn about the autodesk maya history, future
are much more easily prevented this way now, let’s move to the scientific animation
scientific animation is a field that is similar to the visualization in this field the autodesk
maya is used for technical illustration maya also use autodesk maya application
for their pre visualizations of a space ship and the space related content creation also
in many instances this involves to use cartoon or technical rendering engine that produce clean,
crisp and technical rendering in general, these renderings and animation
are highly accurate and very realistic, look like original photographs autodesk
maya has all the tools necessary to address this film to watch directly out of the box
currently forensic and reconstruction industry is also using three d animation tool autodesk maya
for their purpose forensic animation is one of the first
autodesk maya also follows the basic element of cg maya is a large and the complex program
industry to make three d graphics utilization in this industry three d graphics are used to recreate
car accidents, <?>*</?>, or even accident into the work place also
in general, this type of animation are loaded in,
but highly accurate in the timing of the animation details keep out all the
renderance to make them clearer and perspective jurors and expert witnesses numerous new keys
future addition and architectural enhancement complement these three major initiatives
it make autodesk maya an ideal tool for three d animation industry
a highly tuned animation system allow artist to bring their ideas to live with the most
advanced tool for modeling an animated characters currently web graphics industry
and the animation industry also moving to the internet also along with this gaming field,
compared to the other three d application and it is a really really powerful to create three d character
a new field that it autodesk maya becoming a large part of its graphics that is their graphics
the three d animation are used to create websites such as realistic shopping malls where you can
walk through a store, pick up the item, look at them and eventually you can purchase them also
through online payment methodology now, moving to the product visualization this is also similar
to the architectural rendering in that product can be designed and tested in three d software
then rendered to show the investors after the design is drawn up, a three d artist will create a three d
model of the product in the three d design software to test its construction then a visualization
animation will be created to show how the product will work and how it is assembled if
needed currently it is time to augmented reality and the virtual reality also the mix reality in
augmented reality and the virtual reality, a user looks at the world, sees three d elements as a treat
animation for example, if you have watched recent movie like transformer, terminator, harry potter
virtual related technology and developing a benchmark pace
but, what challenges needed to become over for the vr experience to fill truly emotion as you are
actually feel there however it is not impossible to imagine a future where synthetic contents will
be able to react to as an event interact with a real world in the same way hope now you have a
clear understanding about the maya application and their upcoming use into the industry
and all, the maximum movie artist has used a three d animation purpose autodesk maya application
in this session, i will describe the fundamental to intermediate so that you can easily understand
the all commands in detail maya was originally a next generation animation product under the
development of earlier research it was based on the advanced visualizer power animated and the
alias sketch the <?></?> was quoted to the irix, the coding process of code name as maya later on
then it has been joint with the wavefront technology and the silicon graphics
walt disney futures animation collaborated purely with the mass development during its
and the application of autodesk maya into the industry computer graphics, cg has grown into
production of dinosaur disney has requested also that the user interface of the maya application
should be customizable, so that a personalized work flow would be
able to create it this was the particular influence into the open architecture of maya
and it also partly responsible for it becoming so popular into the industry
maya was charging per sheet license that was thousand of dollar per year
early in its lifecycle, maya made some stunning market expansions
maya one point zero was released in nineteen eighty eight then it usually referred to
the alias wavefront technology and the name was alias wavefront maya
it has quickly won the high profile clients also, such as industrial light and magic and
the tippet studio they were previously using the software application
the include of creation, storage and the manipulation of models
but, after a stunning customizable option with maya application, they have shifted
to the autodesk maya application also previously that was alias maya
in the early stage of development, maya started with tcl as a scripting language in order to
leverage a similarity to unicel language but, after the merger with wavefront, the scripting
language is wavefront’s dynamation it was chosen as the basis of mel, maya embedded language
a recent version in maya like two point seventeen, or two point eighteen, maya
support two programming language first is the maya embedded language and second is the python
scripting language the software was initially released for the irix operating system only
however later on, this would be available for
macintosh pc system, linux pc system as well as for windows also this support was discontinued
until the early nineteen eighties, the computer graphics were very expensive due to the cost of
in two thousand six, after release of six point five version of maya application
and it was available into the market with both name, maya complete and the maya unlimited
well it was turned into the single so maya was acquired by autodesk in two thousand five
since two thousand five, maya have been several changes developed by autodesk groups
in nineteen ninety eight, maya has been through many iteration and some confusing with the names
of complete maya, unlimited maya edition it made its way for windows and into a mac os
version also now, the autodesk maya settled into the single version
on february eight two thousand eight, duncan, johnstam, julia and martin received an academy
award for technical achievement for the design and implementation
of maya cure systems also so, maya is a really powerful application which industry use for the
hardware when the voom pc was introduced, the scenario was completely changed
animation and the modeling purpose now before move to the further, we should
know about the basic system configuration which require to run the smoothly the maya application
now, autodesk maya support the window mac and lan platform also the recommended system requirement
for the purpose of running the recent version of autodesk maya smoothly are shown below into
the table intel four i five or later version processor should be minimum of four gb of ram
the hard disk space should be a minimum of twenty gb available for the autodesk maya application
and your computer should add additional graphic card support also either that would be available
with motherboard or the external overview of autodesk maya has been discussed earlier also
maya is an extremely powerful modeling and animation tool it combined all the
necessary tool into the single user interface that is easy to learn and easy to use
even after nineteen eighty, the small industry could also think about to producing
maya is used in every industry, air view pipeline and three d graphics the application of
maya are as follows first, film and videos are two most exciting and the fastest growing area
into the three d graphics world the three d graphics are also used to provide many different type
of effects from the virtual fire, to virtual three d character, to virtual <?>*</?> autodesk maya is
useful to pre visualization of shot in the both of films and the video industry also
if you have a scene of movie matrix, the entire pre visualization of matrix movie has been done
with the maya application two primary type of films are created in the three d animation realm
first is the fully three d animated film, and second is the live action integrated film sometime it
called the visual effect based film also in fully animated film, all the visual elements
are on screen and created into the three d animation software and then rendered and then we convert the
the broadcast quality output because of the growth of three d, three dimensional computer graphics,
data with the help of editing into the watchable video version or the image sequence version
example of the three d animation video movies are toy story, monster versus aliens,
shrek, up movie and so on when we talk about the live action integrated movie
or the visual effect based movie, it typically shot with the real character, but the background
and the other effects are computer generated for example, transformers, jurassic park,
sky captain, world of tomorrows, drone, these are the some examples of visual effects film
recently if you talk about the indian visual effect industry,
there are several visual effects based movies have been making blockbuster into the industry
some of the names are bahubali, shivaay, raone and so on now, let us move on to the gaming industry
the video game industry enable artists to use three d software to create virtual worlds
you have affordable three d content creation options available into the market
and the character that will be played in a video game engine
the industry is massively popular and it is a profitable industry as like a film industry
also in gaming, autodesk maya is being used for low polygon character modeling or the creation
of areas and the architectural backdrops in fact nowadays people perform autodesk maya also to give
content creation due to the flexible environment of autodesk maya and their programming interface
video games created for a smartphones and tablets typically take a few months to develop
but, when they develop a large program such as gear of wars, prices might it will take
two to four years to develop the entire game many of the tools available in autodesk maya,
that have a special hook in they specially for use by to the game developers only this make it easy
for game developers to work with vertex, colors, expert animation data and their game engines
you can create camera based modeling, plugin and the autonomous characters and you can generate
it is also really very useful to create low polygon model to use into the game engines
we can easily convert our quad model into tries and with the help of maya polygon options,
we can restore the try model into the quad also now let us move o the architectural visualization
in this type, each and every person want to see their dream home before construction
so architecture visualization help them to watch everything before entire completion
of real project in real environment architectures have been using computer added
design cad software since nineteen eighty to help the create and better more stable design
for architecture pre visualization with autodesk maya, architects design engines
and film artists can show their clients exactly how their project will look in future
this saves not only time and money, but makes the clients happier as design flaws
realistic, hyper realistic quality content also, like for example, hulk, transformer character
﻿welcome to third module of animation in this module,
right, up and down so, when you have to work into
the orthographic view or the viewports that is called the few dimensional viewport also
it shows the four side which help the top, the side view, the front view and the back view
of any object it is used to move a line, rotate a scale of the model into the three d environment
it has only two shortcuts to get navigation into the orthographic view
first is the alt and the right mouse button, in shortcut you can say the rmb
plus alt also, to zoom in and zoom out the viewport
and you can use the mmb, middle mouse button to turn left, right or up, down of the viewport
for centering your object, you can simply click the f button to focus the object from
the keyboard it is really very useful function to bring the particular model which want to
help line we can divide maya graphical user interface in these sub-elements
work into it it will bring that object inside the scene to your attention and centered into
the viewport by pressing the f button, it will exactly focus your object into the viewport
hope now you have a better idea about the maya viewport configuration
and now you can easily navigate with the models or you can easily work into the
graphical user interface of maya application after completion of this module
so, let us start to discuss about all elements one o one so, we are getting a start with the
menu sets the menu sets are the type of menus, categories are modeling, rigging,
animations, effects and the rendering here you can see into the drop down list, this
all modeling, rigging, animation, effects and rendering options are available accordingly when
you hit on modeling, related to modeling, you can see the several options in top up manuals
when you hit on to the animation, according to animation, the menu has been changed
the autodesk maya first seven menus are fetched and rest change on the menu set, you choose
accordingly the menu contains both tool and action to work into the autodesk maya application
the main menu is that the top up maya window there are several individual menus are available
you will learn about the autodesk maya graphical user interface, the navigation tool in maya
for the panels and the option window you can also access the menus in the main menu,
or you can use the hard box also with the help of hitting the space bar from your keyboard
here you can see the hard box of my application directly you can navigate all the menu with this hard box
option you can activate the hard box using the holding down the space bar into the view code
status line the status line contains icon for the common use of command such as object selection,
snapping option, rendering and more moving to the shelf the shelf contains the tab
that represents its menu shelf the real power of shelf is that you can create custom shelfs also
then it make shortcut to quickly access within a single click for example, if you are working on
a model, then you may require the modeling related options then for retesting the render testing you
may require are render icon over there so, you can customize your own shelf with the help of this
and we will also discuss about the view code configuration of maya application
shelf menu and accordingly you can customize your own shelf as per your requirement
so, this is really very very interesting feature which you can utilize and for the upcoming
practical session in maya application side bar icons the side bar icons are the right end of the
status line it open up the tool to the attribute editor the tool setting and the channel box you
can access with the help of side bar icons the view panel, the view panel offers the different
way of viewing the object and to view seeing you can also display different editors into
the view panel for example, you can use the respective view, where top view only you can
shift this one respective view with hyper shade view also you can switch this one
respective view with graph editor also when you are using animation moving to the channel box,
you can edit attributes you can animate the value for the selected object in channel box,
so, let’s start to getting know the user interface ui of autodesk maya application
you can majorly work with the object position, rotation and scaling
but in channel box, you can also there are some options available like their visibility
and the component attributes also the layer editor have two types of layer options
in maya application first is the display layer and second is the animation layer
display layers are used to manage the object for example, if you have to manage the visibility
and the selection ability of the object, you can use the display layer options but
when you have to work on to the animation, then you can use the animation layer
animation layer are used to play, lock or mute multiple level of animation also moving further
to the tool box it’s a really very essential graphical user interface part of the maya
application the tool box can help you to select and the transformation of object into the scene
the maya has a interface element that group all similar commands together for example, all the commands
and to show the manipulators and you can use the y button to access the last tool also the quick
lay out button help you to switch between the useful layout of the panel within single play
here you can see, this are the quick lay out options are available into the view board
with the help of quick layout button, you can directly work with the outline end perspective that
consists to the hyper shade perspective these are the some templates available with the quick layout
button now, moving to the time slider time slider is a really very useful for animation
it shows the time range the time slider also display the current
time and ease of the selected object we can select the key and drag it also to
the new frame to the change of animation frame also with the help of time slider,
for controlling the view code are grouped together into the view code navigation control
you can set from where your data would be a start to animate and where it should be finished
but there is one more option here, you can see, called the range slider the range slider would
be the appropriate option to use for play <?>*</?> to set the animation therefore, we can easily
modify or correct the animation to focus on a smaller portion of the whole animation
so, when we evolve with a range slider, we can easily work in a small part of animation
after correction of that small part, then we move further to the next part so,
when we are working onto the project, range slider is really very helpful options when we are working
onto the big projects now, we are switching to the playback controls the playback controls
is available into the right corner of the graphical user interface it help you to play,
pause of the animation as defined by the time slider
the autodesk maya is really very complex software, so maya has been divided into
you can go to the frame first and frame last also with the help of playback control also you can
go to the next key frame, to previous key frame also with the help of playback control option
animation and the character manuals the animation or character manuals are help to switch the
animation layer and the current character set we will discuss this animation character manual
in detail when we will work on to the animation module
moving to the command line when we are working to the maya dynamics, or effects part, then command
line help to get input the maya embedded language or phython tap down into it before work with a
programming interface, we should be familiar to the programming language also, to work here into
the application so, in command line you can directly write your script and you can execute
also there is a separate script window also available into the maya to writing the script
when you are working into the big project and that time, you can get utilize the script window also
left and last is the help line the help line give you the short description of the tools
as you can scroll over the into the graphical user interface,
when you over lay the mouse into some options for example, move tool, you can
get the details about the move tool, selection tool or the rotate tool over there
this bar also help you with the steps required to complete a specific tool of work flow
the viewport in maya is very handy to use and it has two different navigation viewport
which is perspective and the orthographic view now, i am going to teach you,
how to use the viewport and the navigate in it if we want to work in to the viewport,
we should press the space bar to maximize the viewport and the restore to four views
just put your mouse pointer inside any of the view port and gently press the space bar
to maximize it and restore of the viewport, again hit the mouse pointer into it and hit
the space bar button for full viewport, you can hit the control and space bar simultaneously to
get in into the expert view also you can do the particular view of maximizing the viewport
with the help of control on a space bar now, switching to the perspective view navigation
perspective view navigation which is also called the three d view also it is a primary view and the
main view to work into it it is the essential and the master viewport perspective navigation
there are some basic shortcuts which you can use when you are working into the perspective viewport
to get work with your object or the model for example, alt and left mouse button for rotation,
alt and right mouse button for zoom in zoom out, alt and middle mouse button for turn left,
range slider, playback control, animation character menus and command line and finally
﻿so, let’s start with the maya graphical user interface in maya application
you can use alt b to the change the background of the viewport or you can use the window
setting and preferences, display background radiant
also to change the other display setting such as the grid and access x, y, z
so let’s create a basic three d object into our viewport so we have something to look at
go to the create polygon option under the top menu and click and drag to create a sphere
or vice versa you can create a box or several standard primitive,
you can create with the help of this menu options
make sure that interactive creation is check on the polygon primitive menu, else what will happen?
when you hit on to the polygon sphere, then automatically the sphere polygon
would be created into the centre of the grid that is zero zero zero coordinate system
maya is an incredibly powerful software that you can use to create almost everything you can imagine
to move around it our viewport, we have few mouse navigations, you can use the alt and
left mouse button to tumble the view you can use alt and middle mouse button to track the view
you can use the alt right mouse button to zoom in or zoom out, or the tolly* the viewport in
or out you can also use the scroll wheel or pull the left middle mouse button to zoom in zoom out
the viewport also these tools are also available in the menu at top to our viewport under view
camera tools sometime, we want to see our model from different views to get different perspective
on the things to layout the geometry properly hit the space bar, quickly you can sharp the one
viewport to the four viewport, that is you can individually hit the single perspective view
to four viewport including left top, front, side and into the perspective viewport vice versa,
when you roll over the mouse into any viewport and when you hit the space bar,
the purpose of this session is to help you to become familiar with the basic user interface
that viewport would be the maximize tap the space bar while hovering with any viewport,
minimize or the maximize that viewport note that if you have hold the space bar,
the hot box option would also popup this special menu will be come to play later on we can do
all facility, we can do entire controlling of maya menu set with the help of hot box also
the three basic dimension in three dimensional space are x y and the axis
the top front and the side viewport allow to see our scene without geometry distortion
as a scene into the perspective viewport by default to stimulate the virtual camera
you can use the f keyboard button to feel selected object, or you can say the focus
selected object into the current viewport you can use the a shortcut to frame all object into
the current viewport the maya user interface the maya user interface setting and preferences
and the feature of maya, so you can start creating beautiful work or three d art work
allow you to change the several settings with the help of maya setting and preferences options
including interface and ui elements you can use the interface or ui element to change
or disable or enable the various ui elements there is an option called the display kinematic
manipulator polygon you can use this option to display the size of different ui elements you
have an option called the setting camera setting camera can use to change near clip, far clip
or the distance of the object seem to disappear as they approach to the virtual camera
setting rendering, with the help of setting rendering, you can change the default renderer to
software to mentor ray, to hardware, to the toon render setitngs undo you can use the settings
undo to get a maximize the number of undo levels also but, when you increase the number of undo
level, it first uses more memory or your computer maybe little slow also creating maya projects
when you first open maya application, you will see this dialog box here
for creating maya projects, you can go to the file project window to create new project
here, you can see all the location and you can set manually the location and
name of your project, maya will automatically create all the necessary
sub folder within the project folder for example, scene, templates, images, source images,
video folder etcetera so, you don’t have to create the manual lays folder later on
the name of sub folders corresponded to what you should have save into them
if you have to save any scene into the maya application you have option called
control s through the keyboard shortcut, or you can use the file and save button
to save all the scenes, to save all the files you are working on, save within all the scene folder
of your project you can use the shift s to save a copy of that file also maya save the
to disable this in window, you have a feature click on the check box, add the button, and next
file into two formats first is the mayaascii dot ma and second is the mayabinary dot mb
many time you want to create different version of your scene file, so you can go back into the
previous version also for going with this scene, we have an option in maya called the incremental
save so with the help of incremental save you can also enable automatically save it,
preset interval by going window setting and preferences you can hit onto the interval minute,
how often to create or save new file you can save the limitations of auto share
also to export your geometry, from maya application to some other application,
here we have an option called export selection or the export so, when you have to select particular
object into the another format, then you can use the export selection and when you have to
export the entire scene to other application, you can go with the export all option by
time when you will open the maya application, this start up option would not would be here
default obj export option is disable in setting you should go into the plugin
manager and you have to check out the same to get access the facility of obj export
into the maya application viewport setting and the selection modes
to change how your object are display within the viewport on the panel toolbar, go to the sharing
some of the options we have to display objects are four shortcut for wireframe, five for shading,
six for hardware texturing, seven for lights when you have to require the wireframe or shaded
option, display wireframe outline or shading same time with the help of this menu option,
you can hit on to the same and you can get enable the wireframe on shaded also if you have pressed
eight by accidentally, it will switch to the paint effect, so don’t worry about the same
again come back to the perspective view and you can work on to the same application
navigating the maya viewport when maya opens you will see a three d view with a blue and gray
so, four shortcut for wireframe help you to see through your geometry into the
display as an outline when you hit the five button, your shaded display geometry color
and the polygon nerves and the shading information you are able to get from the same
when you hit on the six shortcut, your hardware texturing, that means if you
have applied any texture on the model, you are able to see the same into the viewport
and with the help of seven numeric keyboard button, when you hit on to the same,
light would be enabled and if you have create any lights into the viewport, now light also effect
the model into the viewport, and you can see the real time output into the viewport also
radiant background this is called a viewport and it is where all our three d graphics, three d objects,
cameras, light, background and anything are created with the help of maya application
﻿you can hit the drag a mark q around onto the
you can use that drag on the ring x, y, z axis again unable here with the selected object
and you can use the yellow ring to rotate into the ring as space around the current view also
when you are hitting on the r shortcut from the keyboard, now it’s a scale option are enable
so, again you can drag on the cube to select across the axis or the center yellow cube to
a scale uniformly across all to move or a scale along with two axes at once, hold the control and
drag on to the axis you don’t want to add this, or move ever across the area you are if you want
to rotate object around, then you can hit on to the move tool, so you can get notice that
pivot of the objects into the world space, and rotating the object into the object space
now, world space means that transformation bridge onto the global scene axis, which do not change
but, when we talk about the object based transformation
top of object to select anything that include the mark q box if your object is get selected and you
or object as space, the transformation based on local object axis, which will change every time
here, you can see the channel box, channel box display transformation and allow us to import as
specific value of transformation for example, if we have to move your object, you can simply
put the value into the position, rotation or a scaling translate x, y, z axis or rotate x, y, z
axis by putting the value into the channel box sometime, we want to reset all the setting into
the channel box to zero, without changing our object position, rotation and a scale so, do the
same what you can do, go to the modify and the hit the freeze transformation to reset all the value
and here you can see into the channel box, now your object may be moved into some newer space
but, after hitting the freeze transformation, the entire value would be zero, zero, zero axis
so, now it’s a local corner system or it’s a base corner system of that particular object
want to deselect, you can use the control click to deselect the object also for transforming the
now, if you have to modify any object into the component level, we have the some options there
are two basic modes for which you can manipulate your geometry object mode and the component mode
object mode is for object wise transformation of one or more object, y component mode
help you to component transformation of which part of an object there would be moved for example,
when you work into the component mode, you can get work with a vertices, faces, edges,
uv, vertex face and so on so, in component mode, you can work with
the polygon <?>*</?> or subdivision surface you can hit the right click on the polygon model to
switch your object between selecting the vertex, the faces, the edges, the uv’s, the vertex face,
the multi or switch back to the object mode all of the selections and the transformation options
of object mode can be alike individual vertices, faces or edges into the component mode to get
objects into the maya application, we have three options move, rotate and scale
reshape your objects under the move tool setting a scroll down and turn down, you
have an option called the soft selection mode so, soft selection mode allow you to have a smooth
fallout from your selection this can be very useful for reshaping your object
with smooth and tube surface the yellow indicates full selections, black indicates weak selection
adjust the fall-off mode, radius and curve to change how the soft selection tool would be react,
using the attribute editor the attribute editors allow us to see the different bit of information
about the whatever we have selected to across the attribute editor
you can hit the control a or command a for macintosh pc to get enable the attribute editor
button in top of the status line with an option selected, the attribute editor will
display a lots of information for example, transform nodes, shape nodes, creation nodes,
so, now let’s go over how we can transform the scene and the position of our object
material nodes and all transformation node will help you to get info about its position,
rotation, scale into the three d space you can get this to the shape node, it gives you the info
about that what it looks like, also available into the channel box under inputs
if you delete the history form the delete history option, this input node will disappear,
and you will no * able to see this one option into the attribute editor
material node - material node help you to get detail about the material,
which you have applied onto the object you can get the chain about the material parameter or the
shader parameter with the help of material node the attribute editor’s node change based on what
object is selected within the attribute editor go to the list at the top menu, and disable auto load
selected attribute to retain the attribute on to the given object regardless of a new selection
depending on which two are selected, the manipulator will change its appearance that the
the copy tab buttons within the attribute editor allow us to work on to the attribute of two
different objects at the same time grouping and the parenting-
for access the grouping and parenting go to the window outliner to view the list of everything
into our scene including objects, cameras, lights and etcetera you can click on to
the some of items to rename them also from here outliner if you click onto the same plus symbol
to next of an object, you can see the shade node associated with that object also
there are two basic ways to connect multiple objects together into grouping and parenting
first you can use the p button or you can go to the edit option and parent parent to objects
together by selecting the child and then the parent, and you can hit the p for get parenting
so, when a child moves rotation and scale along with also move with the parent object
manipulator indicates the pivot point from which the object will be moved, rotate or the scale
however, you can use the still move of the child object independently of its parent
middle mouse button and drag an object into the outliner to get under the
another object to make it child of <?>*</?> so, simply you can select any object from outliner
and with the help of middle mouse button you can drag the object into the another object to get
parenting you can use the shift p to unparent the object also, or from the menu you can use the edit
and the unparent group give you a very very good facility to connect all the object into the single
selections of the object for creating group you can use the edit and a group option, to create a
group containing multiple objects you can rename the group to organize your objects in also
with up arrow selected group containing the currently selected object so, when you hit
the parent object and hit the up arrow, then the entire group would be automatically selected
you can hit the w button for move to get access the move dragged on to the arrow from the x,
so, hope now you have a basic idea about the maya graphical user interface into the practical
y and the z axis to move along that axis you can click the center of the manipulator
to move along it with all axes at once for rotation, you can use the hotkey called e,
﻿welcome back to the polygon engineering module of animation so, in this module i will teach
and we can create a new project with the help of project window so, here you can see the project
window available here, so we can easily put the name with the help of this new button
when you hit on new button, now these entire options are enabled to fill the value
now, here you can see the primary project locations options also by default, whatever file you
are shared with a maya application, the file would be save into the scenes folder
whatever, the render images you are going to render with the maya software
would be save into the images folder you can change the name of folder also, but by default
maya has given you the best preferences so, you should leave with this by default options,
or as per the industry requirement or your project requirement, you can change these options also
whatever, as you are going to use, you should save entire references into the source images folder
you how you can create the standard model with the help of maya polygon modeling the standard
vice-versa for sound, you have a sound folder for example, if you are a using
any programming, the scripting; you should save all file into the scripting folder
you can use the movie folder for saving the video file; you can use the auto save folder
for save the maya auto save file options also when you hit on accept button, now you can see
in desktop, you are able to see the folder which you have created
so, here you can see the table modeling folder and the
entire folder has been by default created with mail workspace also
now, get switch how you can create a table model with the help of a standard primitive
into the maya application in maya whatever we want to create, we can use a reference according
to the same so, for setting the reference, we have an option call the view image plane, and here
primitives so, i am going to teach how you can create one of this table with the help of
these are the option called the import image and you can access your reference file from here
reopen now you can see your reference image is available here into the viewport
you can go to the panel option and you can use the tear off copy
with the help of same you are able to make copy of this viewport, and now you can easily
so what you can do hit on show, and you can uncheck the image plane so, now image plane
is not available here and your reference is also moved from here
so, the viewport is back in easily, now you are able to create your model
into the viewport front or left and easily you can manipulate the data from the perspective view
i am shifting this one reference little back, so easily we can model into the center
maya polygon modeling standard primitives before you start to work on the same, first of all we
of the viewport that’s a zero, zero, zero position now, let’s start with a box model,
now here you can see the box has been created but, the dimension of box the
height and width of box is little different than the reference images they require
now, move the same and scale it as per the reference requirement
now, here you can see this box has been little modified into the shape of table side panel
now, here you can see we require this one area, again here this one box shape again here so,
so, simply for that what you can do? you can select the box
and you can use the edit options, and there is an option called the duplicate now, the data
has been duplicated, but in this time the same object is available onto the same position
should shut the project accordingly, we can save the file into that project; we should save all the
so, with the help of move tool you can shift your object into the new location,
as per the requirement of reference here, we require one more box here, so again do the same
now, here you can see this one base area of table has been created,
now it’s time to work onto the top of the table so, for making that you can create one new box,
or easily we can manipulate the position of this box from here to use the top view of the table
so, what you can do? you can simply use the shortcut control d for duplicate also, and you
can rotate with the help of rotation option here, in rotation you can use the j button from
the keyboard for snap the rotation now, you can move w for move, and add just
now here you can see into the perspective view with top area of the table has been generated
references into that particular folder also so, whenever we are going to switch to the another
now, it’s time to work on to the rest part of the table
i am going to again stress into the move, and i am going to duplicate the same, and
shift as per the reference the scale it
and adjust as per the requirement of the model, and now here you can see
the shelf, the keyboard shelf has been created, as just as per reference
again use the control d for duplicate,
and now here i am working on to the bottom shelf area of the table
again i am using the duplicate shortcut control d,
and move according to the reference requirement and here you can see there is a back support is
also available into the table reference so, for creating the same what you can do? you can use
computer, entire data should available into the single folder, and we can easily move the entire
this one shelf area of the keyboard and simple you can make duplicate them,
or you can simply put the value from here ninety degree from channel box
now, easily you can manipulate your position of this box with the help of top view
now, here you can see this one area is now
classing the table top area so, here we require to a scale the same, so scale as per the
requirement of reference you can switch into the wireframe view for better manipulation move it
scale it, move it again
and now the model of the table is completed so, now you have an idea how you can create
a table into the maya application we have some references for practice also, i am going to share
folder to other pc and then we will open the file easily, we can get access all the datas,
both references also with you so, easily you can do the practice after completion of this module
here, i have two references, first, table reference is here,
and second, table reference i have is this one so, you have to submit
this both table after completion of this module for your graded assignment
which i was earlier used into the previous pc so, before start the project, we should
create the project here so, for creating a project, we have an options into the file menu,
so, hope now you have a clear idea about how you can model props, for example table, chair
automatically the entire cylinder radius going to be change
why?
because, we have chosen here the instance option
now, here we require to scale the height also
hope now you have a clear idea how you can make some exterior model with the help of
a standard primitive
now, in upcoming modeling session, we will learn about how we can make the add-on detail here
for example, here this one is small detail is available here
so, as i discussed earlier that by default image plane is created into zero, zero, zero
this one area is opened here, the door is available here
these are small detail available here, so according for such kind of detail, we should
switch this model into the poly model
so, in poly modeling when we work, we can have a several options available to modify
our model
for example, we have extrude option, we have a prevail option, we have the chamfer option,
we have the edge loop tool
so, in the next module we will learn about the polygon engineering process
how we can efficiently execute any model within the maya software in right manner
thank you
axis
so, manually you can move your reference with the help of image plane attribute, or manually
you can simply select the image plane, and drag into the z axis
now, let explore this one model in later detail
now, here you can see this one model could be need with the help of cylinder with low segment
and the entire this one model could be like a example of octane model
so, let’s start how we can create this one model pre-visualization in maya application
so, come to the channel it and shape mode, and here you will get the input node
or interior modeling with the help of maya software
in input node, decrease the subdivision axis to eight
in the example
here, you can see the reference is going to be high, so what we can do?
we can use the panel and use the tear off copy option here
and have the polygon from here, here, now here you can see the reference is available
here fine
so, what i am doing here?
now, in this second example of maya modeling with a standard primitive, we will learn how
so, what we can do?
we have a pipe options also here, so for creation of this one center model we can use the pipe also
now, it has been created into the center, so first of all let’s move the scene and
again comeback to the input node
and decrease the subdivision axis to eight, now here you can see it’s a look like the
same as in available into the reference
drag here the thickness value
we can create exterior model
so, manually what you can do?
you cannot scale it and you can increase the height of the model fine
so, here you can see this model ready as per the reference
now, again come to the polygon
and put the value to two point five, now its little fine
here, you can see on top, there is a minority tail like boundaries available over there
so, what we can do?
we can make duplicate this one polygon, with the help of duplicate
come down into the input node
for example, castle or some modern architect
but, here you can see the input node is not available, so what you have to do?
at the time of duplicate select the model and edit option
and use duplicate special option and reset the menu and use the duplicate input graph
now, here you can able to see the input node also
so, now here you can see there is a supporting octagonal also available here, so as i had
created one octagonal model here
with it in this manner
so, i have a reference here which i am going to use into the maya viewport as a reference
now, select the same and here we require to make duplicate this one, polygon primitive
in eight multiple copies
so, what you can do here?
now, it’s as per the reference looking nice, now what we require here
select the object and we want to modify the pivot of this object into the center, of the object
so, what you should do?
you have to go to the select option and you can use the modify, and you can here use the
centered pivot
but, with the help of center pivot what will happen?
so, let’s start, i am going to use the view image plane and import image
as per you selected object, the pivot would be automatically set into the center of that
object
but, what we have required?
we require to change the pivot of the object and we have to set into the grid zero, zero,
zero axis
so, what you can do, from keyword hit the insert button and now you can able to modify
the pivot here
and you use the x for grid snapping, and now here the pivot is moved to zero, zero, zero
corner system
and when your job is done, again hit the insert button
and let’s come to the present folder, present fo * and i have a reference of castel-del-monte
now, see what happened here, now the pivot is set to the center
now, come down again into the duplicate special option, and use the duplicate input graph
and duplicate is special, hit on apply
now, what we require?
we require to make a multiple copy of this one external area of castel
so, what you can do at it and you can use instant duplicate with transform option
and now here you can use the j button for rotation snapping, and for last one you can
repeat hit the g and see the layout of the model is now ready
the radius should be little less, so manually you have to put the value of all disk model
which located in italy
you can use the instance option, duplicate special
now, e and j for rotation, so see now what will happen here, when i change the radius
of this file?
the automatically second file would be also affect
command repeat, g for last command repeat and j for rotation
g for last command repeat and j for rotation snapping, g for last command repeat and again
do the same
so, i will try to create this one model with the help of a standard primitive
﻿so, in this module we will discuss about, how we can create gun with the help of autodesk maya application
about sketching you can do it in rough way, mix some proper lines including deduct part,
each and everything divide it in two parts,
which is front one and side one, because i we have to adjust this into two direction, into two views
so, it is better that you should use two drawings at a time
this one is the magazine area, which covers with bullets
the black part is the depth part, that’s why i am using the black colour to fill these small areas
so, that if we do the modeling, after that when the modeling will be finished for finalizing,
we will use the depth and we will make some sort of changing into depth also
after the reference gets over, we will switch off to photoshop
the lines part are the detailed part,
gun, have captured human imagination for centuries and are featured prominently
so the rough sketch has been completed, the things has been left now, it’s all over and
in next step we will switch on to photoshop
so, there you can see the concept escape of the gun has been created now, in next module
we will jump into the photoshop to refine our reference images
into the books, films and the video as well as into the themes as an introduction to creating
modeling with the polygon tool, we will be model as gun with on this side whatever,
routed into the reality or fantasy all great three d models are based on some kind of reference
before beginning on our model we should first create a basic rough sketch of
what we plan to look like you can use real gun or fictional one as an inspiration also
here’s a fairly basic sketch, we had sketch out here for use as an reference one
for the model of the gun let’s get started i am making some lines which is horizontal and
through paint tool like i also use the same, so i am using the paint tool
right click, different address, save the file
again,
that is
i make the whole gun part so, i am using my fast forward, because you already have idea, how to
make the perception lines and stroke lines so, just right click and you will get a stroke
panel in it, you will choose this stroke after that a certain line will be formed
after this stroke line formed, you should press the delete,
and what i have to do? control j to duplicate this this part is been displace, so i am using
i am dragging my image this one into photoshop
control t and move this little bit so, that it may look like straight, click and drag
this is good because in maya i have to divide this two parts equally this is the
front one and this is the side one so, i have to manage two parts,
if you have a rough idea about sketching, you can also make your own blue print, that’s why what i
have done to finalizing a line and have a refined line, i adjust switch it onto the photoshop
i am taking the brush, and make sure that i have the hard brush
you some colour correction and it’s been saved in jpg now, i have to turn this reference to
maya, then in the next module we will get set up the reference image into maya application
i am just drawing a rough line, so that i knew have a idea i am zooming in-out,
press shift button and click, so a short line will be form i am doing this because i have
made the reference, so the lines are not so prefect because it’s a rough preference
basically, so for finalizing i use photoshop so, that i may have the idea about the straight
lines and all, because, photoshop is very precise in making straight lines
so, i will not put so much of detailes, but just general form so, that i just made the idea,
so like this i will make whole part of it
﻿hello, in this module we will set up the references into the maya application
spacebars going to the perspective press five, move little bit upwards,
just hold right mouse button here, you have assigned new material going to lambert*
the last part here is the colour here you can get a checker box by pressing this,
so you can get a file there would be image folder,
click over there to text off here i have just put my reference
open it's not showing, cause i am not in texturing mode
if you press six, texturing mode will be started now see, it's got distorted few parts of it has
been cutted of course, the <?>uv<?> has not been opened or you can simply go to create uv
there would be a plan re-mapping open this window, here you have the panel
just apply, project right click hold the right click go to object mode
so, i have just make a particular sketch which is a rough one
object mode is what, it will select the whole group
w is for movement e is for rotation r is for scale scale is a little bit
you can also go and have just right click go to properties can also puts this pixel dimension and
width and height in your maya okay if you go to channel box, here you have all the things
if you go to below of it you have breadth and height okay
you can also put this thing, but you can also adjust through this cause
the part you have a sketch, you know better each and everything that how you can manage this if
you if you stretch this up, you have to model it if you compress this up you have to model it
that means this part has been created by you so, you can manage it by yourself and make sure that
you just keep for the top of the grid this will never goes below of it,
i will divide this to two parts this one is different and this one is the site
say spacebar going to the side view,
it's not showing cause i am not in texture mode press six for texture mode
what to do now? i just want to divide these two references separately and for this i will select
this up go to edit mesh here we have insert edge loop tool or insert edge loop tool thus,
it will insert a particular edge now you can easily divide this thing
and will be separated from this reference going to face mode press this one,
or object mode select this one control d for duplicate when duplicated like thing face mode
now, a main problem is that pivot is coming in this way i need to arrange pivot
into the centre so, i just select this, go to modify
remember one thing, if you want to create your own you can use your pencil or
there we have centre pivot same with this also centre pivot
now if, if i look at this attribute editor, it has all the different things and it's get mesh because
new things are being formed so, by selecting this edit,
delete by type history what delete by type does it will erase a few history and
now if you look at this only three parts is been there and the rest useless thing has been gone
it doesn't affect your model or your
work what you have worked in in this but, it will delete the remaining unused part, the useless one
select this go, into channel box go to poly shape
if i want to rotate this thing the y part is rotating just press and put ninety,
pen to have a sketch make sure that it doesn't matter that you have each and every line should be
there you have the front part, here you have this side part and together they form the perspective
i will model in this two* part and we'll manage the process into perspective
your straight and perfect the matter is what the part what you are making in maya, that's matter
i am going to front view this is one front and this is one this site okay, of this
space bar, go to plane, if i drag this plane up,
press shift to drag proportionally press five
in this module, we will start our project through dummy model or you can say the basic
this time i am pulling off my reference
turn off your grid, through this small icon
so, this would be the box
there would be inputs and here is the subdivision width
you can change the number according to your need
simple click on this, right click hold your right click
there would be a small icon which states x-ray but it is turning off my reference also
right click, assign new material there would be lambert and here is the colour
if you turn the colour on and the transparent value it will only affect your model not your reference
right click vertex
model of the gun
these are the vertex, you can adjust the vertex through your reference
if you hold your right click there would be face also
by click over this you can easily delete your face for these are not needed
go to the prospective, now here is the rough dummy of your body has been generated
just drag this and delete
so, our rough body has been generated
in next module we will make a grip panel and the muzzle part of the gun model
so, let's get start
now, i have two references which is in the front and the side one
so, i have channel box and attribute editor
i just close this out
by hitting a spacebar, it will maximize the particular view
here is the left view and if you go there this would be the turn off the grid
this would be the box, if you drag this and drag this again it will generate the depth
by spacebar again you should go to front view
so, let's get started
lambert, this would be the transparency
hold your right click vertex
you can adjust the vertex according to your reference
for extra details, i may put some extra amount of segments but in later works
edit mesh, insert edge loop tool, add extra edges due to curviness among its body
go to the front view
what i have to do, just put one segment at the centre of it, so that i may divide this
into two part
now, it's possible to go to face, delete one part
after that when the model gets over, i just put one symmetry, which is just equal to the
i've already made my dummy model, which is the body part
first part
for rotation should go to e button, press e and rotate the model into the reference
object mode, go to the side view
this would be the cylinder which is the silencer part of the gun
click and drag, drag again, to generate the depth
go to the front view and the side view
align it properly
by pressing r, you can scale
go to channel box
here, you have the input
i'm again taking a box
so, we don't need twenty, we only need eight
so, i'm going to vertex, move this up at the backward okay
for extra segment i should go to edit mesh where you have the insert edge loop tool,
just simply click and drag to add some much of more edges
go to face
polygons at a time
go to edge, extrude, r for scale, scale this little bit
go to object mode
go to vertex
extrude and scale this in inward direction
select this and move forward
the last one to move at last
so, a rough model has been generated
in next module we will make trigger guard followed by adding some detail into the muzzle
select this, go to the front view
and grip panel of the gun area
move this a little bit
here is the edit mesh and you have the insert edge loop tool
by simply clicking you can add extra edges
right click, assign new material lambert
see there are the files
﻿in this module we will give you the detail of the muzzle
go to the edit mesh, there we have to insert edge loop tool
move this a little bit through the blue, rotate this now again, extrude
then we have the insert edge loop tool insert some edges,
go to the perspective, right click object mode
select this particular part,
<?>needs your base</?>, drag a little bit
central align it, go to the perspective after that <?>lead view</?>, go to vertex
grip panel by adding trigger part into the gun model so, let's get start
which is edge edit tool, here we have the insert edge loop tool
add some <?>images</?> select this part delete, go to vertex, select the bottom one,
move a little bit same for the top one,
the last part
go to object mode, select this file now in perspective so, we have completed the base layer,
base model of the gun i am going to channel box, there at first what i have to do, first select
the model, go to edit, here we have delete by type history now, it will erase your history content
extrude again by pressing r you can extrude this, inverts
i'm selecting this particular part, and i click vertex, select this vertex, move forward
and again, r
extrude this in inward direction through the loop
select this particular faces through shifts collecting
go to extrude, move this little bit above this <?>effects</?>
now, the central part, again extrude but in inward direction
go to object mode, select this part
and the side one
so, at first, i will select the first facing part
this is the first facing part still this up a little bit this would be fine
going to edit mesh, and we have to insert edge loop tool, add some edges,
now, we need supporting edges so, after clicking this a little bit forward
and the second part by shift selecting move it backward
going to the left view,
to meet some edges which is between the model while going to vertex select this
particular part and drag this up a little bit same for the bottom one, the backside
and the front one this would be fine
going to left view again, select this part move a little bit backward
now, we have the top part to be left, so going to face select this particular face
hit on extrude, move this up a little bit this would be fine
same as the back part, going to face select this part, again hit on extrude
right click like, select this face going to the perspective
we'll move up a little bit
just make it <?>slantly</?>
now, it's done but, at first going to vertex, after that insert edges we will make some edges
for the detail part of the gun select this edge and we have to move this little bit
in next module, we will create front side of the gun and adding some more detail
into the muzzle and the body part of the gun and implementing symmetry into the grip panel
by holding shift you can select multiple faces
edit mesh, then we have the extrude increase this a little bit
select this part, go to this side
select the box,
rotate a little bit go to the vertex, select this particular vertex as m move,
in this module, we will do the *<?>seeing</?>, the modelling of the grip panel and the implementing
select the faces
extrude
move this a little bit
select this too
this would be fine
go to object mode
little bit of adjustment, select this one
move forward, oh!
its moving the difference also
and select individually
the symmetric version
select all these
will put some symmetry
later on, go to face, select this part and edit mesh, extrude
quite good, move this down
delete this part and go to vertex
the vertexes
so, let's get started
-
there would be a small gap, better i will manage this later wards because after when
i have to finalize i will look all this, this would be okay
yeah, but i will manage this all thing in next tutorials
save that duplicate special
we should maintain through the top part of the gun, forward object mode
in the next module we'll add symmetry and the supporting edges into the model
fine, one and four, this would be fine okay
i have just edit the three, four from five
edit mesh, extrude, should move forward
delete this part edit mesh, insert edge loop tool
-
in this module we will continue with the previous video
so, we need some segment over here also, so i am first moving the vertex, going to edit
so, going to object mode again, press three, now the part is looking good
in next module we will add extra detail into the body and the front side part of the gun
so, let’s get started, i am selecting this part,
so i am adding into the corner part, so that the smoothness will be preserved and some part will be shown as an harden view
so, click over the edges corner,
same at the back part, here also
﻿so, in this module we will add extra detail into the body and the front side of the gun
so, let’s get started, going to face, select this part, select this one and this one,
go to edit mesh, extrude, little bit forward,
that’s look good, face,
edit mesh, insert edge loop tool, put some edges
at the corner part,
this would be fine,
object mode, check the <?>sub smooth result</?>
﻿in this module we will continue with the previous session
select this part
or this one, move this a little bit, this would be fine
go to edit mesh, there it is insert edge loop tool,
by pressing three smooth result,
rotate this a little bit, that’s it
go to object mode,
isolate this thing,
select this part and what i have to do, i isolate it because i have to work in the
stand part of this gun also, so i am just selecting a particular part, go to
so, let’s get started, i am selecting this part, going to isolate,
go to face
go to vertex,
move this a little bit,
go to object mode, select this part by pressing one,
a little bit, i will scale it inwards direction, object mode select this and insert edges,
like this object mode,
select this part, this is top grid part and
go to face select the bottom part of this particular grid part and select all,
go to edit mesh, insert edge loop tool
move forward, it’s <?>updating</?> in the
beside of this particular part because i have already putted the symmetry, so duplicate special
v or merge vertex tool, i can easily track this thing or by pressing v also it can be achieved,
same with this part,
object mode again, due to lack of segment its getting so much of smooth
and isolate it, go to object mode, select this part and press three for smooth view,
press three button and its get smooth,
insert edge loop tool
in the next module we will add small parts and give detail into the gun surface
this is the trigger guard but it has a smooth curve, so i need to add some much of
edges to its corner, so i had just isolated it
go to edit mesh, insert edge loop tool, put some edges at the corner,
go to face, select this part, go to edit mesh and extrude it by pressing w
we should, yeah, extend it out,
﻿in this module we will get continue with the lower <?>spoon</?> barrel
move at the top, move forward, zoom this a little bit,
this would be fine
zoom this vertex, select the all,
move forward and this one, move forward, object mode,
make a new box,
going to vertex and draw boxes like this, select the face,
extrude this a little bit, rotate this or downward direction move this up little bit,
go to edit mesh where you have the insert edge loop tool, insert some edges,
and the lower side and the hammer part of the gun so, let’s get started
zoom this a little bit, scale it up and manage its level, same with here
select this one, extrude this downward direction,
object mode, select this, press three, its smoothing very much,
i have to adjust at the bottom of the gun barrel, so by pressing one harden view has been formed,
okay, i am having a box,
<?>we pivot is</?> soft slow, so by bracket i can,
i can increase the size of the pivot through brackets,
through bracket down, the size of the pivot decreases, <?>add through</?> bracket up
the side of the pivots will increase, move forward this is the handle part of the gun,
so increase the sub division level, go to face, select <?>one on one</?>,
go to extrude and move forward by pressing w move forward,
i have to scale it individually so, this would be fine, go to the another view,
i can, i can judge it very similarly better than to switch the view over, now
to select the top part i should switch the view in this particular region, move this up a little bit
okay, select this one, again extrude and move forward,
this would be fine, what is this? this is the grid part of the gun
if i select three, see its all being smoothing very much,
that means i have to insert the edges into its corner,
so i am going to face, select the faces, move this little bit,
press three, that’s good, rotate this minus ninety,
rotate this again minus one eighty, scale this down a little bit,
move this
okay, i will put this symmetry later on
right click at <?>face</?> select this one and move forward
and we’ll manage it in later wards, at first i have to complete the base model
followed by some shot up details, going to box again, select the box, <?>edge</?>
hit mesh and insert edge loop tool, yeah here it is
hit extrude, this would be the trigger part of the gun,
upload some edges into its corner,
press three smoothing occur, object mode select this one, press three again,
select this one, move this a little bit pivot, adjust the pivot,
successfully, adjust the pivot through v, rotate it through r, sorry for e
move forward or scale forward through both direction,
press three and check your smoothness and i have to add insert edge loop tool to its corner,
this would be fine,
this would be fine, press three, object mode, select this one,
﻿in this module we’ll make bullets and the magazine part of the gun so, let us get started
select this one and here you have polycube
increase its subdivision width and height by two by two
now, its smoothing, so i am pressing one, go to attribute or you can shut it down,
insert edge loop tool, increase the edges by its corner,
vertex, i am switching over the view, just the front one, select the bottom,
move forward, edit mesh, insert edge loop tool at the top part also, go to perspective,
scale this down a little bit, now its <?>prevail</?>
okay, i am having a box, increase this upward,
go to front view, select the bottom part, increase a little bit,
go to edit mesh, insert edge loop tool, edges at the corner,
so let’s check by pressing three object mode, it’s not so bad,
go to face, select the top face, base one extrude it up little bit,
go to edit mesh, insert edge loop tool, set some edges to prevent excessive smoothening
at the lower, at the front, at the top, you should check
by pressing three button how much smoothness its occur
edit mesh, go to insert edge loop tool, insert some edges,
move this forward, this one also,
here also three and object mode,
upward also minus ninety which is rotate x, scale this down a little bit,
much more, move this forward through w, upward,
this one
rotate this through e,
now we will extrude the same, at first you should check that it is
alright or not, this face has been left, so extrude this up, press w and extrude
right click, object mode,
going to channel box, increase its sub division width, height and depth,
select this one, press three and have some edges which is insert edge loop tool
press three, check mode same for this one also,
face, i will select the small and the large part of the face by pressing shift
and will click on the boxes, by holding shift we will click on the boxes
it should match the level, insert edge loop tool and insert some edges
go to vertex or even object mode, so i have to select this faces,
go to face, select this faces by pressing shift and click, go to extrude w and move forward
for symmetry it’s also occurring in the another direction which is just opposite of your model
of a particular shape, edit mesh and insert edge loop tool,
add some edges at the corner so that it will smooth but not so high, this would be fine,
this is fine,
rotate this a little bit and check if this is okay or not
stick this two part and little bit downwards, move forward,
right click, face, select this one and what i will do? i will extrude
so, let’s check
okay, going to face, go to extrude w
is the grip part, insert edge loop tool, not so corner but yes you can adjust it,
and move forward, this will be fine, extrude again,
select this one w and move,
i am putting edges at the corner,
press three, a duplicate has make, so i will delete the duplicate part
okay, something has been happened so i am control z to have undo,
so now it’s good, so i will put some edges once more
this seems good but we will put edges at the corner, insert edge loop tool
okay, this would be fine,
now it’s, it’s good,
select this one and move it forward direction,
its look good but it’s very much off scale, so i will scale it now, this is fine and
going to another view, zoom this a little bit, go to vertex, select this part
by holding this, move this a little bit because i have to align it through the model,
now it’s aligned
move forward, edit mesh, insert edge loop tool now, attach the corner part, add some edges so
that it will never get smooth, it have some smoothness but not so high, press three, a
rough structure has been formed, scale this down a little bit,
i just go to edge select the corner and will extrude it downwards, go to extrude and by
which will be kept inside, for smoothness i will add some edges into its corner
adjust the later wards, at first we will make the bullet through a cylinder, let’s make
the bullet, once again i am taking the cylinder and move forward, so <?>volume</?> has been
move forward through w
be much more in size as compared to the other part, so what i have to do select the face,
three, now the bullet’s shape will be occur, part is some much more of bullet, select this
one, move this little bit, now i have to align this bullet into the magazine, so i am scaling
and rotating it down pressing the value of ninety which is straight angle, move this
little bit and keep it inside
at first i have to duplicate this after that i will align the same, so let’s duplicate
control d, repeat the result i should use shift d, it
will repeat the result, if you have done control d after that you can do shift d, select this
one, move this little bit and rotate it because your bullet are diagonal, so it will adjust
into the magazine
now, it’s looking good, select this one and control g for group, rotate ninety degree,
bit, see the size is very high so i am scaling it down through r and rotate it through e
go to vertex, select this, going to one end just move, this would be fine and delete this
two bullet because we don’t need it and another bullet is there
see, delete it because we don’t need it, going to face we will select the cap part
and we’ll increase its length not so high but this is good, right click and object mode,
never forget to save your file, so it’s looking good enough, select this one, align
it okay, pressing three and control g for group
select this one and apply which is duplicate special, now the duplicate special
one in x direction and apply, now duplicate special has been done, <?>apply</?> close,
it should maintain pivot whenever you are going to duplicate special, whenever you are
going to use the duplicate special, so it’s done
in next module, we will do the <?>rename</?> process into its part and combine the similar
things into the group
up through r
now, move this, i am making the magazine part of the gun, so i will whole in one part which
is e top one, not in the bottom one, just select only one and extrude it, scale it down
a little bit through r, move this through w okay, center it and if you don’t want
to center it’s okay and delete
so, now its <?>whole</?>
﻿in this module, we will get continue with the previous session and we will make the grouping
this is called grip panel,
select this one
or this two at first, group this up, this is
front sight,
this one and the another one control g for group, this is side panel,
the body one, select this two control g for group, this is gun base body
lower handle,
this one lower grip,
select this one control g, its group now
hammer, this two,
and combining the things in this part we will rename all <?>the *various</?> gun part
group this up, barrel exposed,
this one eye piece,
this is the base body, control g for <?>grouping</?>,
it’s not going to group at the first, this is gun base body,
i have to make the trigger so i am dragging a box,
i should add this up,
just select <?>lower there</?>
three okay go to vertex select this two,
move little bit backward, select this one move backward and this one forward,
so i have to add some sort of segments into its corner,
so, let’s get started okay, i am selecting a particular part and going to channel box,
go to insert edge loop tool which is in edit mesh, add some segments,
control z, add segments press three for smooth adds <?>*5:29</?> rename this trigger,
select this up, rotate a little between minus ninety
s w, go for this view, drag this up, scale it down a little bit okay, adjust it,
press r for scale
and now again align this by looking at it,
it’s <?>totally</?> fine, little bit of thickness, scale,
i have to delete this two reference because the model has been completed,
so i should press delete, select this magazine, move little bit forward
now, our model has been completed, it’s a simple model
through a rough sketch and you can also prepare it by your own
after completion first week of course you have to submit
two graded assignments followed by reference available into the course assignment folder
for evaluation purpose so, now get ready to work on to the projects and give your
select this part rename it muzzle okay select this one,
control g for group rename this bullet,
and rename this, at first <?>*1:50</?> group and this is front strap
select this one and this one including the body part control g for group and for all its group,
﻿hello everyone, welcome back to the production pipeline third stage that is lighting,
which is a toggle button so, if a tangent is facing over here,
it it has higher intensity at this point and lower intensity at this point
so, if you click here, you found one more controls, as you can see it will fall off your light
render preview as you can see it’s bouncing quite well, and we have the darker area also,
but, we have used only one light, so we will just close that rendered tab
now, if you click over here, your ordinary light will form without having any tangent
so, like this way you can just put your light and obviously you have shadow and you have depth
map shadow, which will create some depth into, and ray trace shadow is basically for reflective
surface or refractive surface so, for a time we will check this because we are in mental ray tab,
so, we’ll learn how we can work with the camera in maya application, and we will understand
so you have to check this if you select any object, right click assign new material
and i will just select all of them at first assign new material and you have the
phong e, so as you can see it’s getting reflected and also you can change the transparency level
as you can see all of them are affecting, because we have putted only one texture in all of them
so, as you can see it's reflecting quite ray trace shadow, so it will bounce the light quite well
and what i will do? i will just off the grid and we will just select the light control d we’ll put
somehow over here control d, we will make it back ok so, now what else you will do? go to colour,
will change the lighting colour by lighter blue we will change this colour to i think somehow
white and now as you can see it has three lights which is bouncing from here, here and here
the render setup and batch rendering also here how we can easily generate image sequence in maya
so, if you just have a few and just look at your render,
so what you will get? you will get a cool nice detail as you can see here three lighting are
bouncing on your model, and also the model is producing some sort of the ray trace shadow
ok so, you have shininess and also that’s way you can just work with attribute editor
if you want to change the colour of the shadow, if you want any image here,
you can just go to there click here and just have any image, it will just show over here
so, if you need mountain definitely it will show, as you can say a little bit of changes
as you can see now, it’s getting changes, it producing some sort of texture also
because we have just taken the mountain reference and just put it over here, so,
yeah it’s working like texture ok so, but it’s not texture it’s only a map inside your shadow,
application, after successful completion of camera understanding and the fundamental of lights
so each and every panel has its own map if you see left, as you can see this thing each and every
thing has its own map ok each and every light has its own map, so you have the mental ray tab
if you found this checker box that means it’s all go to your map map means your image or maybe
which is present in maya or even in computer ok so, it just go over here and just have the images
file will just directly call up your file, which is present inside your system, and these are the
pre-loaded textures inside maya ok so, make sure that whenever you are working
in reflective surface, it should on your ray trace and so select and see just have a look, fine
so, now we will just delete this light,
and we will press six again
now, it’s a time to get learn the photorealistic lighting with the help of maya ies profile after
if i press seven kind of lights working quite well as you can see this is a
torch light, so you can change if you want to see from the light you can go first select the
light, go to panel and here you have the perspective so, you have in the perspective,
but we will go to look through selected now, you are seeing from the light as you can see here,
the light which is just casting over here change the colour to little bit of bluish and
also the intensity by default intensity would be one you have to change it,
if you need more if you are working in a huge light setup, you can have more so, control d
will just duplicate this light as you can see both are forming different lights here,
you have the one light, here you have the other one, so like this way you can work
successful completion of this all fundamental option in maya application, now it’s a time to
quite well and also we will just put it over here and just change the colour, so as you can see
as it is producing the light source and here you have the darker region
it’s also producing the second light source, as you can see both are generating
circle, we will select the light, we will delete the same, so we will press six
and here we have the area light so, area light by default has the intensity of one,
but it needs to be increased quite well and if i press six, seven, now you can see the area light
area light is completely depends on intensity as each and every light is depend on intensity but,
if you increase the size of the area, definitely it will just affect your scene
so, if you are decreasing the size, definitely you have to work in intensity so, increasing it you
don’t have to and you have to just down this value to very low level, so, we will change the light
get learn some production ready output that is we will learn maya interior lighting and the maya
something like this, so this is basically for window light as you can see,
here we the mental ray node and also if i just have a look
if you want to see the shape of the light, so you can see from here use light shape which is
inside area light, inside the attribute editor area light shape one ok so,
as you can see area light use light shape and you should have to check the visible
ok so, if i change back to your render screen and what we will get, let’s see so, as you can see
this is like a soft box which is present inside studio, especially the photo studio so, you can
work like this, if you are not satisfied with the shape you can just off the shape by simple
going to area light use shape of now you can see the shape, ok so like this way you can work
exterior lighting in these coming sessions after successful completion of these all things,
this is the last light which is present in maya in mental ray tab, which is volume light
just click over here, it is just like that of a omni but it has a higher volume, which is higher
intensity as compared to the omni so, as you can see it’s not dependant, not your shape, and
if you go nearby, your lighting will fall ok so, here you have the colour and
like this way go to shadow, depth map shadow, now so ray trace shadow
so, definitely it will work on your shadow and if you press t, you have the controls of light
if you press in this button, you have more controls if you want to go to your previous,
click over here, press w, and now you can move your light so, these are the features
and now as you have seen, we has covered the basics of light introduction chapter and also
you have the little bit idea about which light will affect how much it will affect and what
we will learn how we can assign the physical sun and lights in maya application for daytime
would be the shape of the light so, let’s meet to the next session for a detailed discussion
rendering after successful completion of these all sessions, now it’s a time to get learn
the third party render like arnold, mental ray or the turtin in maya application
or look and feel development, or sometime you can say aesthetics developments also
so, as per industry requirement, we will learn any of these third party application, how we can use
mental base ray or the arnold based render in maya application some time it’s called
indirect illumination techniques also now, let’s move to the module number eleven,
where we will start from the fundamental of lighting, and how we can utilize the lighting and
their use in maya application hello everyone and welcome to this course, so in this session we will
discuss about the introduction to lighting so, we will start from basics and here you have the
maya interface, and so what we will do? we will go to polygon and we will just do a quick
setup that means you just do the quick setup, so i will normal mode, which is five pressing
box, this cylinder
and one more thing is the sphere
so, after successful completion of modeling and texturing, now it’s a time to lit up the product
so, we have three things and including this particular part, we have four things we will put
somehow over here, we will turn the grid off for a time select this we will put somehow over here
we will put somehow over here and also just have to flip over this so, now for this session
we will understand the concept of lighting, and also will just go through its parameter
because it’s very basics and so you have to just work out from basics and let’s start
i will go to the rendering tab and here you have the lighting features, which is present over here
make sure that you are in rendering tab also when you go up, you will found all the lighting
parameters and texturing parameters, which is situated in your rendering tab so, that should be
fine and also you are in rendering, so discuss lighting one by one so, for lighting we have
to go to attribute editor to adjust some of the settings so, at first this is the ambient light,
or the character here so, here in lighting session we will discuss the entire lighting
so clicking over here, your light will be form at this center
now, this light is basically for lighting a particular area, which is a,
which maybe a huge or a small area, that means it will focus on a particular section
if you press seven, you can see the light, as it’s a ambient light, that’s why it’s just showing your
model like this you can decrease the intensity, and if you see the render, what you will get?
we will get like this so, you have this shadow which is casting over here and also
if you want to increase this shadow ray trace shadow, and just shadow radius,
shadow rays and shadow limits so, as you can see
let’s change the view, as you can see it’s forming the shadow now and also if you decrease the
shadow limits, depth limits, it will not produce like so hard, and it has some soft corners only
process in maya application in five sub module or sub session we will discuss the introduction
as you can see it just faded off, if you just put around one and let’s have a look
just put one, it will just little bit fade up your shadow so, right now will be in zero
and also you have object display so, we don’t require this, because we will discuss laterwards
if you want to change the colour, you can change from here
and now one more features, if you go here, you found the direction light, which is
second the point light the spot light which is third and fourth, so you can change from
here also so, this is the area, and now its changed area and this is the directional so,
like this way you can change, so i will make manually, so i will go to press six
here, you have the directional light, it will click over here, now you found the light
which is pointing towards here ok so, i will just enlarge this and if you
of lighting here then we will discuss about the types of lighting in maya application
are enlarging the directional light, it will not affect your intensity, as intensity is very very
much important in lighting especially in the three d software so, as you can see, if i press seven,
we found nothing but as you can move this it really changes the light detail will change,
if you move this light so, let’s have a render and let’s see what happens
so, as you can see it’s working quite well, and
if you want to change the colour, you can change from here
as you can change it’s affecting your scene, so you can also change it from here if you change
the intensity, you can change it quite well, and control d, now you have two lights so,
in a particular scene, if you have two or three light that would be better because
rather than having one light at a time, you should go for two or three light,
there are several types of lights available in maya like direct sunlight, ambient light,
and you can also add different colours so, right now i am not focusing in it,
i will just tell you the features same we have this shadow and the mental ray
so, here you have the emit photons, so what photon does? it will just calculate the internal
lighting, and also it will just smooth some of your corners like this particular section,
which is which has two connections one is from the model to the surface,
and another one is the from polygon to polygon ok that means this face, this face one correction and
this model this part and downward part so, it has two connections, so it will just bounce that
thing, bounce the shadows into the corners so, like this way you can increase the emit
photon, but it will take time and ok so for a time i will just off this thing and it’s
coming under mental ray in caustics and global illumination we will discuss this in detail,
point light and so on we will discuss all these light in detail in practical sessions in upcoming
in laterwards so, here you have the shadow, so i will just select use mental ray shadow,
and also you have the custom shaders
so, we don’t require this, as you can see the size select and just have a render
so, it’s completely depend on the direction of your light, i will increase the intensity by
seven hundred so, if you just rotate this, as you
can see the direction of the light gets changed if you rotate like this, if you rendered this,
as you can see the direction really changes if you change the arrows that means the arrow which is
facing here, it’s facing to the model light is coming from here that means this arrow denotes
that particular thing in source of light is here somehow here, and it’s falling to the object
sessions after completion of lighting, now it’s a really very essential to assign or lock the camera
point light also called omni ok so, i will click this point light and it just form here, and if you
go up as you can see a soft type of light this is also known as bulb light, so, as you can see
it’s bouncing quite well so, in maya if you are using any external source of <?>10:46</?> light
physical channels, or the environment light, or the daylight, or night light system then you can
put one or two light that would be fine but, by using this all, you can’t just have
a good lighting in from only one light so, you have to adjust two or three lights in that model,
or sometimes maybe five or six so, it depends on you, so i will just select
this light and here you have the colour so, same the colour and if i select the light and just put
or press t button, you found the tangent which is this so, as you can select
the tangent will move and it will direct the lighting shape, and here you have a arrow
before start the rendering, or before start the lighting in any three d kind of application
﻿hello everyone and welcome to this course of maya image based lighting so, in this session
what you have to do, you will go to polygon and here you have the normals, you have the reverse
so, you can reverse your normal, now you can see it happens sometimes as you can see here also we
have the same problem and so will select this, go to normals and you have the reverse so, you can
and just do some much more tweaking in this thing
so, we will start walking and tweaking as you can see this part is getting shadowed which is good,
because we just use only one light now, we will use two or more lights and will just look at the
render, and after that will increase the amount of final gather and global illumination
so, as we have applied the blinn, it’s reflecting quite well and okay so, will not glow this thing,
because its morning and we don’t require to glow all the things so, what we will do? we
unchecked that means it is off in maya auto load means whenever you open the maya,
will just click this off the thing and will make some more lights for little bit of bounciness
and what i will do just go to the omni which is point light,
click the point light and we have just drawn the point light here and we will just move it around
here, will make sure that you are saving your file because saving is very important and will
just move and we will move here and will press seven for examine the light view as you can see
if you press seven, you can go to the light view and i will change the colour to little bit of
bluish, and will change the intensity also because we don’t require this amount of intensity,
and here you have the shadow panel so, in shadow you have the shadow like
use ray trace shadow, so it’s on occupying more things like rate of shadow limits it will just
smooth your shadow and you have a shadow rays also just increase it
it will load that particular plug-in so, if you are not finding the mental ray on
input to right radius ok, fine even you can also work with depth map shadow,
but we don’t have any map, so just put this off now have a look before rendering the same what
i will do? i will go to render settings, and in common you if you go here you just find the
size so, i will just decrease this level of the size three twenty into two forty
because we have to examine it after that when we do the final render,
will just increase the size by going to ten eighty p, which is full hd or, even you can go to four k
that will take around a huge amount of time, so, we will just off this and will do a test render
as you can see the intensity is quite high, so we don't require this amount of intensity,
plus we also have to just work in this particular section of light
so, will select the light and will decrease the intensity little bit, i think we will just
the render settings, what you have to do? here you have the mayatomr dot bundle that means you have
judge that it is looking good or not if you are rendering the same, you can have the idea,
so just put the intensity by i think two would be fine let’s have a look
to check both of them, if this doesn’t check then it will not load the same if this doesn't check,
then it will not show on your render settings so, mayatomr dot bundle is very important to check
that particular thing, if you want to work mental ray so, after switching to mental ray, you have
all the features and one more thing is that so, we are using this simple interior
and you can find this interior model in arnold sessions, so, we will just use this
interior arnold session also so, at first what we have to do? we have just created a camera
so, i will go to panel and here you have the perspective, and here you have the
we will learn about the process of image based lighting inside maya application so, before
render underscore camera so, we have created the camera and we have just set our render view
now, we don’t require this film gate, so if you click over here, you have the film gate just click
and now it’s fine because in compositing software, you can add the film gate,
and here one more thing is that grid off because grid is getting distracted
so, if you press spacebar and right mouse button, by holding right mouse button, you can go to
perspective now, you have the freedom to rotate, and you can check your render settings and render
lights and all here so, i will just take some more space, because two is fine we will
do the adjustment and will just check from here, we will just render it from here
so, before proceeding for the same, one more thing is that make sure that
just select complete model including your camera and just make a new layer and just right click
going to image based lighting, what you have to do? just go to render settings and here you have
and add to select it, ok you can rename this layer so, i will rename it int interior,
like this, if you want to hide your reference but, we have to do it, so i will just put r,
what r means? that means it is just reference the same that means you can’t select anything
inside, because it is converted into reference now, what happens see, i will go to render
settings, and here you have the indirect lighting system so, indirect lighting here you have both
option, which is image based lighting and physical sun and sky, so, we’ll look both of them, so here
you have the image based lighting so, image based lighting just click over here and just created a
dome as you can see here it’s just created the dome which is outside world so, now you
have the image, so i will call up a image and you should have at least hdri images for that ok
the render settings panel in render settings here you have the option render using maya software
so, as you can see we have couples of hdri images and we’ll select any of them if you
just click over here, we have this image and if you just click over here, we have this image
so, you can download or even you can click with your camera so, we have these images
and what we will do, i will go to maya and will choose the image and here we in desktop,
here we have the hdri images and here if you choose any of them, let’s see what happens
if i select this open, now as you can see it just overlapped into your dome
so, you can change the hdri
by simply rotating it, you can change the hdri by simply rotating it as you can see it’s changing,
so you can change it, and now if you look at your room, what happens let’s see here, the
so, you just go to mental ray and after going to mental ray, just have all the features which is
as you can see the light is bouncing so much, and also we have this roof, which is black
so, we have to just sort out it and one more thing is that we will just go to six,
let’s press the six and just go to here here you find that this part is getting darker, so
what we will do? will just go to channel box and will on the reference now,
and in indirect lighting here you have the common parameters, where it is,
so as you can go over here, we have the common parameters, which is just decided and in common
parameters, you have the render options, so here you have the render options
in render options, we have to just uncheck enabled default light, so what happens let's have a look
as you can see the default light which is present in maya is off, now the image which is outside its
specially for mental ray now, will change to maya software, if you don’t
casting some short of light from here you can just increase or decrease the level of exposure,
but i will just put for a time zero, and now what happens next, i just minimize it now,
you have to select the dome and if by selecting the dome you can go to attribute editor
and here you have the detail of all the things so, you have all the things like advance,
you have legacy and you can go to mental ray, and you can have the transform and all ok
so, by selecting this light and one more thing we’ll go to render settings again, and in indirect
lighting panel we have to check the final gather which is here we will check the final gather and
i think we should increase the global illumination by checking it final gather map, we don’t require
and it needs some amount of light also for illuminating the same, so by having only one
find your mental ray, then what you have to do just go to window and here you have the setting
light you can’t even do all the scene lighting, because you need some more additional lights for
the same so, for that what we have to do, we’ll just go to here and we’ll just select the box,
and we’ll not select the dome we will select only the box and will go to channel box, and will just
turn the reference on so, will press f for fit to screen, now you can select, i will press four
now, you have a better look and we will change, and we will apply few of the lights
here also so, here you have the rendering tab and i will also open the rendering tab here,
and you have the lighting features so, it depends on you, if you select any of the panel,
it will show its property feature at the top so, in rendering panel, you have the area light
which is here if i click here, now our area light has formed, you can see so, we have to increase
the size of the area light as we will just go over here, and we will focus on the same
and preferences and here you have the plug-in manager so, plug-in manager what does it means?
if you rotate this, see your x value is changing, so we need minus one eighty and after that
here ok and we will increase the size, we will go to five pressing, and will see
so, what we will do? will just pass through the,
i think this part would be fine will pass through the window and just have little bit
what we will do we will select the light and move forward
i will increase the size little bit, so i will go to attribute editor by selecting it and
will go to area light shape and here you have the area light panel, so
you can change the light type from here we will not change the light type, increase the intensity,
you can increase from here and you have all the features like in this section and so you have
it means that all the plug-ins’ which are hidden in maya, you can just on it or off it according
mental ray, so you can go to use light shape i go here and just make a render,
that’s why it’s casting so amount of light we have to just decrease the level of intensity,
by default it is one point zero but, we have to just decrease the level of intensity
will decrease the intensity a little bit and as you can see our background is bluish kind of
thing, so we will change it to i think, which is contour colour as compared to the blue and also
one more thing is that i will just go to channel box, and i will just on this thing, will change
the texture also, from going to assign new material and here you have the mental ray so, you
have the material also, so you can use the mental ray materials but, right now i am using simple
blinn, and after using blinn what i will do? i will go to blinn and just use the colour like
this and if you are not finding your colour here,
to your need so, as you can see the tick mark is basically which is on inside maya, and the
﻿hello everyone, so in this session we will start the linear workflow inside arnold with
the pixel panel so, you can work for the same ok like this way so, i will just, will not change,
will cut this, because we have to work again, and it will just, one would be fine
now, what happens next? we have created this light which is casting from the window basically the
light will fall from the window also, so we don’t have any kind of you can say glass and all
so, i just put it this light, you can make glass and have transparent
texture in it, or you can usually use any of the shader and use the transparent value
ok and followed by the reflection so, right now i have this whole area which is blanked,
so if i select the camera it will not select because definitely the camera is in another layer,
and including the interior which is locked so, i will just cut this thing for a while and will
off this, because i need more space so, what i will do? i will just make another light which is
you have to zoom out, or you have to fix the position of the camera so,
the area light as we have told you that we will generally work in area light in this tutorial
because it’s very important to understand the property features of area light,
and how you can manage all the things so, ok to have a clear view i will go to press four,
perspective, and in perspective and we are in wireframe so, as you can see i will just
drag this light like this basically, ok and also we will go to the you can say the scale button
ok now we have to face this at the ground level
that means this particular error is facing at the ground,
so if i press seven you can see it’s collapsing to the wall, so we don’t have to collapses to the
wall because this part would be fine because we have to focus in this part only, and i will just
right now i don’t need it, so if you want to open it film gate, that would be fine for you ok
drag this you can see its getting fade off if you are dragging this, it will crease this particular
part because the arrow pointing at the top, so i will just drag this down little bit and what i
will do? i will just create this light little bit of yellowish in colour, because we have already
created this particular light in bluish colour so, will go to colour and just create some amount
of yellowish in colour, and also will just put little bit of yellowish, ok and also the intensity
which is very important so, intensity i will just, ok i think thirty would be fine, so will
click thirty and also it will change the colour little bit lighter, because it’s very yellowish
ok fine so, you don’t have to worry for this particular region, because we will focus
in this part, which will not be visible, as you can see which part basically if you are working
in night light the common light, which is the outsource light will be blue ok
now, instead of moving here, what i will do? i will go to the another view,
but, the opposite light will be form a little bit of warmer, that’s the main phenomena between
the night light, so that’s very important if you have daylight, if the outer light is
orange then definitely the another, the opposite light will form, which is bluish in nature so,
right now i am going to this particular view and will set this camera to perspective ok
fine because we don’t have to disturb the camera view, as you have disturbed all the things will
be gone so, that’s very crucial thing that you will not disturb your camera view
make sure that you are saving your file, which is very important so, right now i
have used this light and will just do one more thing, instead duplicating a particular light,
you can duplicate well control d but i prefer to make another because we exactly we have to manage
it according to our need, and also we have to change the colour so, right now i will make
which is this particular i will press space and right mouse button and go to perspective ok so,
another light as you see this light is little bit of lighter in nature, which is lighter yellow
and now i am making same light here, so instead of going to this particular
i will press four to have a wireframe, so what happens now if i just press e will rotate the
same and also will face here only so, instead of using one light at a time, you should go for
having three or four light that means each and every light had its own intensity, and each and
every light have its own different intensity also we have some panels, you can adjust it, so
instead of having one point lighting you should go for three, four or six point lighting,
that would be fine because as light gets attracted to your environment,
all the things will be visible to its form and if you are working in the night light and
if the environment has some short of light, definitely all the things will be casted so,
now i have two views, so i make some amount of space here, so that
that means few lights which have high intensity, few lights which have low intensity, few have
which has much more lower intensity, that’s a main phenomenon between the interior lighting,
especially in the interior lighting yeah you can also work in the exterior like the same way
so, i just putting the light over here and finally we have just putted the lighter colour here
and will put the darker yellow colour here, so we’ll go to attribute editor,
and here you have the arnold light attribute so, exactly what we have to do just click the colour
and the intensity would be a little bit lower as compared to this one because as this is a soft
light, you can say because the colour is little bit whitish and this is a hard light and also
the property of the light is same, because we are using the area light
but, it only depends on the intensity if you have higher intensity, light will cast more if you
we will just focus only this two view because the front and the side we don’t require as you
have lower intensity, light will cast less so, because that’s the colour is darker than
this one, i will decrease the intensity i think will go to seven and just have a view, let’s see
what happens if i press seven, you can see now my scene is getting heavier, so i think twenty
no, not twenty, twenty six would be fine, because we have to see the render view also so, now it’s
casting upward and this casting in the downward region, will just move it here like this way
so, let’s have a test render, so that’s very important, you have a test render, ok so,
will go to panel, perspective, render camera one more thing we have to do, we have just light
which is just front of the camera so, i will just move it here and put it somehow here
a problem if you just keep on the camera, no problem,
make sure that your visibility the light shape visibility would be off,
have front and the side so, right now ok one more thing we have just found this one, so we don’t
which is very important as you go down, you will find that the light visibility will be off, so,
that’s very important and use colour temperature, it will directly go to the kelvin so,
if you have higher value, it will go to blue if you have lower value, it will go to red
so, i will discuss this laterwards and will off this, and will go to this view
let’s have a look what’s happening so, i am just clicking over here, so as you can see,
you can see that we have used the eighty eighty intensity level and also we have just have thirty
and twenty six, then also we have some darker so, i am not using the exposure value right now,
because we have at least to set the light as you can see small grains are forming because we have
used the lower value of camera aa if you increase the value, definitely it will smooth,
and by following this camera aa, you have to increase diffuse, specular transmission
need it, delete so, now as you can see this is a small interior and one more thing we have to do,
and this two which is sub surface and volume indirect also, so will off this for a while
and as you can see we have just built some amount of lights in our interior, and always work in this
particular view you can see and have examine in this camera view, because if the camera will be
displays and if you are working in the multipass rendering thing that would be very hectic,
because each and everything will be displaced from its position that’s going to be difficult
to manage, so what is multipass rendering? we will discuss in this multipass topic
we have separate topic for that particular one so,
i think we should let’s meet to the next session, so in next session i will add some more lights
and will just have proper render and will test the render again so, let’s meet to the next session
so ok one more thing we have to do as you can see this part the bed part,
if i do f that means focusing, its get reverse so, what i will do? i will go to mesh display,
the help of maya two thousand eighteen so, as you can see we are in arnold tab right now,
and here you have the reverse, so, i will reverse the same now, problem has been sort-outed, ok so
this thing will not be reverse because i have just putted that texture only ok so, now what i will
do, i will just set some lights over here, so that we will work in this particular view so, i will
just maximize this particular one and after that we will go to layer editor, and what i will do
i will put all the things in a separate layer, so i am making a new layer this would be fine, right
click, add selected now, you can see that we have separate layers, so i have made this reference,
so you can select ok so, our camera is also in this particular layer, so accidently you can
select if you click over here, you can select, ok so i am making it reference, and i will delete
this layer because we don't required, now what’s next? we have this layer which is the interior
so, i will double click interior, i will rename this, save, we have to put the full name
so it will be installed by default when you install your maya two thousand eighteen
now, let’s start to work in the arnold tab, so we can use the rendering lights also, which is
by default present in maya if you are working in the low version of maya like two thousand
seventeen, sixteen, fifteen or fourteen, you have all those lights but, if you want to work with
arnold, you have to switch your render settings here you have so, we have to switch it to arnold,
so that whatever you wanna light from the rendering, you can also work in the arnold
so, that means this light can work in the arnolds, and obviously yes,
the arnold light will also work with the same, because we are using the arnold render engine and
so for texting purpose make sure that your camera, diffuse, specular, transmission,
sub surface scatter, volume indirect will be always low ok if you are working in
the ray depth that means the ray depth file, this would not been effect so much if you wanna just
so, now what i will do? i have this interior which i have made, and i have simple shaders and
lower the value you can, but i think it should be there because it will not affect so much
but, definitely it will gonna work, it will affect your pc and also your ram so, it
basically depends on your ram and also the graphic processor unit so, i will just rename this one,
one, so that we have the test value, and after we are satisfied with our result,
then i will increase this value ok so, camera aa basically when you adding some lights,
it will just fall off all the lights, that means it will create some smooth result on your scene
so, diffuse will produce some amount of you can say contrasting colours
so, and specular this is always work in the you can say reflection or refraction,
transmission value it will transmit the light through photon energy sub surface scattering,
and volume indirect so, i will put all them the value of one, i will just cut this
what i have done i have putted the colour into these shaders only so,
and one more thing we will go to the common tab and we are using the, you can say if you go down,
you have image size so, right now i am not using high definition, which is hd, i am using
six forty, four eighty this would be fine, ok no problem and one more thing image format exr
exr is a high quality image, so you can work for the exr, jpg would be low quality and png always
so, you can work in exr, tif or png, if you are comfortable with jpg, no problem so,
i am putting it exr and by default it’s here, ok now what happens already i have just referenced
this particular layer, and put it all the objects and the camera in this particular layer so,
right now i have a camera and the interior, so let’s continue for lighting
now, what happen next, so what i will do? i will put some amount of area light,
now i am working in the area light, so let’s start so, i will make this night light,
i am not using any type of textures here, as you can see we are not using any kind of texture
so what happens now? i will just press five button as you can see you are not in lighting
mode if you press seven button, then we will go to lighting mode as the lighting is not present
and any of the light is not present inside your scene, that’s why is showing in black colour
so, i will go to five again and here we have the area light, i will click over here
now, you form the area light which is forming here and now move the area light here little bit,
as you can see if i just press f button we will found this light which is pointing here,
so the light will cast from here that means this particular arrow will be somehow you can say here
i will just put it somehow here, so click and just move it now,
what i will do? i will just put it at the center and will increase the size and also this one
ok so, that no corners will be left,
i have one small camera setup also here, so as you can see i am going to panel perspective and render
let’s have a look if i press seven, then you can see small bounciness will happening,
if i press seven here you can see here so, what i will do now, i will just select
this light and will press five again and will go to the attribute editor so, in attribute editor,
you have all the features here, so it’s very hectic too just scroll it down and all
so, i will just go to copy tab, so i prefer this one, this would be very good because it will just
make a duplicate copy of this and will just put it over here so, you can have a particular look, so
that would be much more convenient for me, so you can work in the same
so, here we have the intensity, intensity is very important if i press seven as you can
see intensity is very low, ok so now what i will do i will increase the intensity,
so as you can see i am increasing the intensity but, i think if i press <?>it</?>, what happens,
camera so, you can see this is our particular view, so instead of having bookmark, i will go to
now it’s lighting proper well so, and one more thing i am doing the night light,
so we require two types of lighting which is the warmer and the cooler lighting the
warmer lighting will be cast inside this scene, and the cooler light which is the blue light,
which is cast from outside world because i am working now in the night
light system, and already we have discussed about the daylight using the
physical sun and sky so, right now i am working in the night light, ok so as you can see here we
have the features panel make sure that your cast shadow will be on, if cast shadow will not be on,
it will not produce any kind of shadow so, each and everything is fine, ok no problem, and yes
the colour, colour value is very important, ok so i will put some amount of sky-blue light ok
little bit of sky bluish light and
the camera you can also use bookmarks, so if you need it and here you have the show film gate so,
now what happens next, if i just go to this particular section
and already we have decreased the value you can say the render settings because,
we have decreased all the values and also we are using very very you can say compressed version,
which is six forty, four eighty, no problem now, i will just select any of them, because if you are
selecting here, you have the interactive you can say interactive render view so, if i go to here
as you can see here if you press this button, you have only one time render that means if
you are changing this model, you have to render it again like this, ok that’s the main thing
so, if you are working here that means one time render, so you have this render so,
if you are working here, you have some features of panels like this one gamma and exposure,
which is also been here but, you have all the things like this particular display panel, and
if you click, you can find this part which not been renderable if you want to render,
﻿hello everyone so, in the previous session, we have just make the lights and just adjusted it,
you can say, shadow and this also, this shadow is soft as compared to this one and the top part is
getting soft bounceness and this part also having soft glow and all
it’s also spreading its light and we have just tweak it because we have just a put omni in them,
which is point light and if you can look at this particular section cupboard and
what we are getting, it is also producing soft kind of shadow
now, you can take this image and just go to the compositing software like fusion and new
and do the colour correction and all and if you want png, that would be better or exr because
this thing will not come like black and you can put some background thing to avoid it and, also
you have the exposure setting, if you can work with the exposure that would be fine
as you can see, both the lights are open now if you just grab this like and after that if
so, what i will do, will go to the perspective we are in, you can say, we are in
you want to just put some brightness, you can just work with the exposure and not so
too much because otherwise it will ruin the whole scene so, like this way, you can work quite well
and now you have the idea how you can change and how you can just do work with your proper lighting
and just have the parameters and all so, as we have discussed that, it’s very very you can say
very different as compared to your render screen that is not possible to show everything in render,
otherwise your system will not run smoothly so, whatever you want to do, just go to a
wireframe mode and just do all the things and after that, if you are satisfied with your result,
just go to the render view and have the values to be put like not so higher value, but yes,
and one more thing is that, now it’s time for you to do something like model and after that just put
some normal texture and just render the same so, and after that, you just have to work with the
wireframe mode and will zoom in this particular focus by pressing f and what i will do, i will
attribute editor and all for the parameters and yeah exactly so, like this way, you can
work with your lights you have to play with intensity and also you have to look at the
proper casting shadows and as you see this image, none of the shadow is harder so, each and every
shadow is lighter, softer, so, like this way, just put some softer shadow in the interior
go to press six, select this part and in arnold tab or you can go from the top here we have the
lights, and here you have the mesh light so, this thing is there so, if i click over here, now it
transformed to mesh light now, if you go to mesh light and have a render, what you are getting,
you are getting nothing see, this is not there so, we have to just modify it,
ok? so,
what we will do, we will just select this part, go to attribute editor
and here you have the property feature of mesh light
so, at first, go to the light visible and increase your intensity so, i will increase by
so in this session we will make some more modification in this scene so, let’s start it
fifteen and will change the colour so, i think little bit of warmer, let’s have a look
so, as you can see, it’s quite like spreading in the whole area
so, if you decrease the intensity by ten, what happens?
yeah, ok, this is fine now, for more bounceness and a
circular type of look, i will just apply one more light which is by default present in maya and this
is the point light click over here and just make a new point light just move it like this and just
move it inside it so, we have just moved inside it and we have just situated the point light here
and i think will just change the colour to like this and just have a look
as you can see, it’s bouncing quite well and also producing some amount of
shadow here as you can see, it’s also producing some amount of shadow here so, now,
what i will do, i will just go to this part which is the perspective and
what we will do, we will do one more thing if i rendered this particular section,
we get little bit of problems, which is, we want a particular light here,
which will take the colour of this and will also remove this section because it’s getting
weird and also it’s not good in this place because it is look something wrong so, we will just
change this and we will just put a box and after that we will render the same data
so, i am going to the wireframe, press four and what i will do now, i will just go to
poly-modeling and i will just create a box as you can see, the box has been created here
press f for focus that particular section so, i will press r and will increase the size
if i press seven, then it will pop the lights now, if you can see this part,
make sure that you are saving your file, so i will save scene as and will go to desktop
and here we have the interior now, i will save by zero zero four and save as, continue
now, i just make the box and what i will do, i will just go to six and just select this part
and go to the arnold tab and here we have the mesh light so, we just make the mesh light and i will
change the colour by little bit of blueness and will increase the intensity by twelve
and also we will do one more thing which is very important light visible
so, if i see here, what we are getting, let us see
as you see, it’s getting quite bounced and, i think we have to reduce the size, i think
and we just have to increase its intensity also so, intensity would be i think twenty five, fine
and just reduce the size little bit because its going outward, i think it’s quite outward
let’s have a look
yeah, it is working quite well as you can see, here we have the bounceness and now one more thing
is that we have to just work in this particular section so, we will work in this section
and, i will just render this image as in png or you can also render it in exr
so, in png, we will just have this area to be transparent and in compositing software,
i will just put some amount of painting and all or even the outside world so,
will just grab this data to compositing software and we will do some tweaking inside
this particular pic so, ok now what we will do, we will do one more thing
is that we just have to focus in this part and it is this thing
that is the photo frame so, we will just put some photo take the face, ok and
what you will get, ok i will just off this, will go to the render setting and will go to render
so in colour, i just put a image so, file and go over here if i have the image,
ok i put the image of this particular thing
and it’s not showing, but it may show in the render and do one more thing, reverse
now, it’s showing, but still we have problem, will select the face, go to uv, automatic
now, it’s the problem gets solved we have used the planar mapping so, now,
we have to just focus on the top light so, what we will do, as you can see, the light is getting
so much of outside the home so, will just decrease the size, as i will go to four,
and will move somehow over here ok and for this also, will move,
and will change all the data by one so, if i just select the render file,
as you can see, the problem get sort outed and now i will do a render and
also, there is a problem, i think we have to change the border colour because it’s
matching so much so what we will do, we will just change the border colour
will press five, will select this part, press f, go to six, right click,
assign, new material, no at first, we have to just select the faces, one by one,
assign new material and here you have the shader which is inside arnold and here you have the
aistandardsurface and in standardsurface, you have
the colour so, at first i have to just delete the history and
control s, continue and now, will just have a test render
i think it’s fine, it’s quite fine as compared to the previous one so,
if i go to the render data, this part is getting darker but still there is light so, we just want
one more thing if i go to my window and here you have the outliner,
so you have to group all the things, so that i will just select
the lights only by shift selecting, control g for group and rename this as lights
now, already we have grouped this model and all and these are the camera,
these are the default light which is present by default in maya and now, one more thing is that
we have to go to render settings and now it should be around nine, diffuse should be around
three or four, specular should be around
three, transmission should be three, sub-surface scattering four and volume indirect would
be at three and ray depth, each and everything is fine i think each and everything is fine
i will cut the same, make sure that you are saving your file and will make a new version
to glow this part and also we will put one box here in this area so that it may glow quite well
so, will make a new version and one more thing is that when you go to your render setting
and here you get the common and in common, where you have
the image format so, i will change it to png and after that, here you have the image size, which is
present by default, which is hd five forty so, i will just take this as in ten eighty p or
even you can work in seven twenty but i think you can work in ten eighty p because it’s a full
hd and you can also work in four times hd, which is four k so, i will just put ten eighty p and i
will just render it and now i will show you the rendered data so, will just pause this video
and i will just show you the rendered data hello, everyone so, as you can see that we have
rendered the image and we have all the things like, your bounceness, it’s getting cut off
because the light which is just beside the wall and it is producing a soft kind of,
and here we have a seam, so will just remove this particular part and let’s start work
hello friends
that means this part
ok
so, on more thing film gate
film gate is important
if you use this part, that would be ok and or can use from here, sixteen millimetre theoretical
and super sixteen millimetre academic, so these all are the film gates you can use
see, the part which is coming here this will render only this data
so, i am going to users and just work here
if you click over here, you find this area which will not be in render, so if you put
your model like this, it will render only this part, not this one
we can execute the software data into the common playable format
so, film gate is important to show that whatever you have coming in the view
so, you have film aspect ratio which is one point thirty seven, this is fine
and, this we do not have to required it
this way near flip because right now if i go to the heavy scene then we will just
focus for this thing
so, you have one more environment background colour
you can have image plane
but we don’t require to create from here
you can also create from your texture menu like going to assign new material and put
some plain texture in the same
let’s switch to the maya and now have look how we can work with the camera and how the
so, these are the common, which is very common features of camera and whenever you are using
or animating a camera, you should always just go to the perspective, at first, i will go
to the perspective, just select the camera
if you are holding its position and will start from the beginning then you have to do one
more thing
as you can see, the values has changed because you have just fixed a position so that you
can start your animation of the camera from this
and what you have to do, we are in first frame
so, right now will go to the modify and you have the face transformation, so, right now
from the beginning, you have to start from the first frame, after that you can go
so, as we do in animation, that is very simple, in camera also that’s same
if you press s button on your keyboard, all the things will be animated and after that
just click over here for auto key
so, we don’t require to press s all the time in between the timeline
so, we will just go up here and just move your camera or if you getting any problem,
just go to perspective or camera once
just move like that
ok so, you have one more key because i am moving the camera
hello everyone
ok
we will select again
so, as you can see, it will just animate your whole scene
so, in between you just have to put some keys, so that it will focus quite well like that
nothing will get out of your frame so this is the frame, so, like this you can animate
ok
so, in this tutorial we will learn about the properties of camera
so, you can just select by pressing space bar, you can select all the frames and can
have the shifting and all you can shift as we have discussed in animation classes
so, like that you can just shift from one place to another or if you want to just focus
in between them you can press shift and just have shift this, ok like this you can work
and ok
so, as you can see, we are producing some jerk, because i have just rotated the camera
if you press control z it will just disable your key or just delete your key by going
to back
so, like this way you can just add some animations like here and as you can see, that’s going
out of your frame, so it’s not going out of your frame
so, as you can see, we have just setted a simple scene and this is a interior scene,
for more smooth animation, you need some more time and also if your pc configuration is
good as you are working in a very heavy model, that means each and every frame needs some
time to render
if you are working in mental ray otherwise if you are working in <?>unwound</?> that
means its takes some huge amount of time
so, that’s the main thing, batch rendering is very important, that means you have to
cover your project into two or three pc
one pc will start render from one to ten or even one to twenty and another pc will start
from twenty one to forty
like this, this is called the batch render
so i have deleted this part and i have just made this particular interior
so, we will discuss this laterwards, but at first we will understand the concept and the
property features of camera more into next session
so, let’s meet to the next session
it is a very low detail and have low quality
so, what else we have to do, we have to understand the concept of camera
so, i will just select this interior and what happens, will go to window and now in the
welcome back to the class
outliner, in outliner, we have just grouped this interior in this, so i will just rename
this int
now, we have another group, i should delete it because we don’t required
ok so, we have this interior which we have grouped it
so, right now what i will do, i will just select this interior and press control h
ok so, camera basically works, if you go to create and if you go to camera, here you have
three types of camera
but this is the stereo camera which is entirely different from three types of camera
this is the multi stereo rig
so, this both are different
today in module twelve, we will learn how camera work in maya application and we will
these three are little bit same
so, here you have the camera
as you can see, this is the camera and if you select any of the object and make any
of the object like here
ok so, if you select the camera and just go here, move up here and after that, you have
to go to the panel, perspective and camera one, ok you can’t see
now, you can rotate like you rotate in the perspective and you can just go back or just
move here and there or just pan across your scene
so, if i go to this view and just press space bar and right click, go to perspective, now
also learn about the render setup and the batch rendering in maya application
part is the camera
so, that means you don’t have to change the camera view and in perspective you can
manage or in left or right or front
ok as you can see, if i move the camera, it’s automatically updated over here, see
that’s the main thing about the camera
so, this is a one type of camera, will delete this and now, will go to the camera again,
create camera and there you have the camera and aim
so, if you click this you have the camera which will look at its aim
this is the aim
so, you can just move this aim wherever you want to move
render setup and the batch rendering help us to execute the inner sequence or the video
so, this will always point towards the aim
so, this is the camera with aim
so, rather than deleting from here, we will go to the outliner and will just delete the
camera, because it’s situated in the group
so, one more thing is that in the create panel, you have the camera aiming up
so, here you have one more controller
you can just control this
it will adjust the aperture of the camera
as the camera moves, it will fix to its position
from a maya application, which can be easily play into the any media
particular, which allow you to do the banking of the camera, as you can see, so you have
more freedom here
so, will select this, you can move this as it will directly point like that of camera
and aim
but you have one more panel, one more feature, you can just bank your camera or you
can even move your camera, wherever you want to move
as you can see, it’s just following the upper tangent if you want to move, see it’s
following the upper tangent, so like this way you can work
and now, if you go to the create and you have two more thing which is stereo and multi stereo
it could be on television, it could be on computer or the laptop or the android phone
rig, so we will discuss this in compositing classes
so, will see this through in compositing classes
so, right now, what i will do, i will just go to window and go to outliner because camera
has the group, inside the group it has all the control and features
if you open this, you can find this
the aim up, these are the locators
so, will select the camera and will just delete it
ok
so, now as you can see, that if i go and create a simple camera, camera and create a simple
camera, so, if you will click and go to the attribute editor, you find the property features
also
of camera
so, at first, i have to go to the panel perspective and camera
so, you can see, the camera is focusing here
if you go the angle of view, can see that it is changing and it is updating quite in
late
so, that means it will take some time to update
as you can see, our grid is becoming like this
so, that means, its angle of view is changing
so, our grid is not changing, it’s changing the angle of view
so, you can just have like this
so, converting the three d data or you can say converting the software data, which could
ok
so, after that, focal length
focal length is that, as you can see, this is the focal length, that means if you increase
the focal length, definitely angle of view will change
so, like this way you can work if you just move like here and just move like here
you can change
you can have <?>see</?>, you can have to just rotate like this
so, the focal length and the angle of view both have changed, so, i just press control
z or command z if you are in mac
so, camera scale, it will allow you to scale
be easily play into the common medium is called the rendering, where with the help of rendering
hi everyone welcome to this course so, in this session, we will add a camera and will
decrease the intensity both of them and also will just remove that area light for a while
and just use the physical sun and sky for an examine purpose
and will change the colour to around kind of velvet type of colour so, will select
and what i will do, right click, this is also selected, so, we don’t require to select
that part right click, assign new material, use the lambert and just change the colour
to lighter, fine
select this and delete it that is the duplicate one, so right click, assign existing material
so as you can see, lots of material to choose from so, right now what i will do, just select
all the files, go to edit, delete by type, this tray, now it will erase of its <?>s tray<?>
do random animation in the camera and also will put the textures in this interior which
that colour so, right now i will just select this part and will delete the same
so, what else we have right now, we will just select this part, ok so will do the control
here so, make sure that you are saving the file so, i will save the file, so save scene
as go to batch render underscore zero zero one so, we have saved in ascii and now, what
else we have to do?
i have made and after that will just use the batch render process to render the same
we will just select the sofa, the complete set of sofa and right click, assign new material
so, i will put some blinn so because i need some amount of shineness, so will put the
blinn so, after that putting the blinn, will just change the colour to darker red as you
can see, now it’s forming quite well will select this part and use the assign new material,
blinn and just change the colour to little bit of bluish and also use the transparency
to lighter yellow, fine, object mode so, we have two table lamps we will see laterwards
so, let’s continue
ok fine
to work, right now will go to assign new material and blinn and after that will increase the
ambient colour so, we have increased the ambient colour and incandescence will save
now, what i will do, i will at first go to the mental ray tab and in mental ray, you
see, we have set up the scene
we have forgotten this part, i think we have to select one by one, will select this part,
control h select this part, control h now, i am hiding the panels now, will select this
part i think we have to select all of them right click, assign new material, blinn and
outliner we will just delete this group because we don’t require <?>12:36</?> is fine, and
we have just shift h, then select all, then shift h and go down here all the things is
have all the features like indirect lighting and all so, i will not use physical sun and
as you can see, as we have increased the incandescence value of here and it is glowing quite well
and also this part so, like this we can have some more details and if i increase the incandescence
value and luminosity of both of them, it will just give lights very much as you can see,
sky right now i will use it laterwards so, i will go to the common tab what i will do
and sky as it will take so amount of time so, you can use it, well, you have to just
keep the render going on so, as you can see, it’s working quite well, you have to apply
the lights over here also, here also and we need some amount of main light also somehow
here
will select both of them, control d, means you get the same and will move somehow here
and if i press seven, what we are getting this complete set is getting lighted and also
it after i select this box, will make it over here let us have a look make sure that
now, i will select all the parts one by one and will start texturing it ok
the object will not float
assign new material and lambert because this is basically a carpet and we don’t require
to use the blinn this would be fine
now, what else we needed? we need one more light, so i think we should use the area light
simple scene ok
so, i will select all the parts and right now, i will click, right click, assign new
so, we will go to shadow and here we have the depth map shadow, will increase the resolution
and also will use the ray trace shadow let’s see what happens if i press seven, it’s
too much because intensity is very high so will use the cooler colour as in contour to
so, just rename this we have already make underscore zero zero one ok
will just decrease the intensity level and ok because here the light is going outside
that is why it is not spreading too much as some of the lights is going outside but here
hello everyone
ok
so, i will click over here, will go to desktop here i have kept my file so i will just select
any of them
so, i think i will select this
if you press seven, you will not found any update in your view screen
as i will just have a render, as you will see, the intensity of the light is very low,
as you can see
by default, the intensity of the light will be low
and what we have to do, i will just select this light, will go to attribute editor and
will just go to the intensity and will increase the intensity
so, in this session, we will learn about the ies lights inside maya two thousand fifteen
as you can see, it’s affecting the background, ok no problem, we will put it somehow over
here and will change the render size because right now, i am just experimenting it
so, i don’t need hd
go to six forty, four eighty, ok fine, and if you look at it, now the intensity is change
it and only affect the ground position, not the whole part
so, like this way you can add your light and also, if you look at the another thing like
decay rate, if you go to linear, what happens, see
click over here and you will found changes, see the intensity of the light by default
has lowered because we have changed it to linear
if you go to quadratic, it will lower again and cubic also
so, let’s continue
so, no decay, i have just selected the no decay and also here is the shadow rays
we don’t require to increase the shadow rays and it will just take huge amount of
time when you render the data
so, use mental ray shadow map over it, we don’t require because we are using ray trace
shadow, so we don’t require that particular one
so, here we have the intensity, you can change the colour from here which is by default same
in all lights and you can just have to put the intensity higher
if you control d it and just move it from here and what you will get, let’s have a look
will change the colour too
now, will select this light and will move further
so, at first i will show you how ies light work
if you move here, you will found more defined shape
if you just select the light and move further, that means if you move further, you will not
found any defined shape
so, if you move like here, you will found defined shape
control d, duplicate again and just put it somehow over here
ok i am just putting over here and just have a look because we have to experiment it first
as you can see your ground is getting so contrast but it will not show in the render
it will only affect this particular part
so, make sure, it is not showing in the render
here, will select the light, control d again
at first, i go to the render settings and here we have the maya software, so if we go
the intensity is changed and also you have to just give the defined shape of the light
because the light is not been copied
if you just move the light from one position to another it will not been copied
so, select the light, go to the light profile, here you can see it has not been updated
if you go here, you can see it has been updated but here it’s not been updated
so, you have to update the light
well, if you just duplicate it, your light profile data will not <?>gain</?>
so, i will just select, go to file name, desktop, find and select this one also
down in the common tab, here you have the render option
go to the light shape, light profile sorry
we don’t require to go to light shape
we are changing its profile
just bouncing the light from here, it’s just bouncing the light from here
but in live view, if you go your viewport you will found that it’s all white
it’s like burning, so it will only produce the softness into your render screen if you
in render option, if you go here, you have enable default lighting
just keep on render and just look at it, now you will get all the details
ok
but if you look at your viewport, you will not find any detail and not find any proper
information
so, rendering is very important, that means just check your file by one on one render
ok so, here you can see, it’s getting darker, this part only
but in live view in viewport, it’s all white, all contrasted, all burnt
so, rendering is very important to check your results
so, in next session we will discuss this ies light into exterior
so, let’s switch to the next session
so, i will uncheck this because i will adjust emit the light from ies so i will just add,
i will just off this thing
and as you look here, what we have
so, in module thirteen, we will learn about the ies profile and we will also learn how
point light which is omni
so, i will make a omni and will shift it over here through press seven
just go to this position, as if you see the render what you will get, you will get this
circular light, this circular type of light, which is forming by the omni into the walls
so, i don’t need this, i need the design light like this the triangulate light
so, this are called ies lights
so, i need the triangulate light, the design light
the design lights is called the ies light or the wall focusing light
we can use the ies profile lights in interior scene as well as into the exterior scene
so, now, will go downwards, let’s check is it open or no
it’s not open and will go to indirect lighting and will check both of them, global illumination
as well as final gathering
so, you off this and now will go to this position and i will just copy the tab so that i will
see exactly without having problem
so, will go to shadow at first
so, make sure that your shadow will be in ray trace not in depth map
so, we don’t require depth map
we require ray trace and if i go to a mental ray tab, here you have the feature called
light profile
so, ies profile help us to generate a beautiful artistic shape of lights, whenever you are
this is the one of the most important thing
now, this point light which is circulating into your wall will turn into the design light
which is ies light with the help of this
ok so, we will cut this for a time and what we will do, will just have the light, so here
you have the ies light profile
so, i have downloaded the ies light from net and when you click here, it will just show
there, the light profile attributes
here you have to file name
ok just click over here and here i have the ies light pack which i have kept in my desktop
so, these are the ies lights and these are its photos
going to the any hotels, usually you can say, some of the spotlight is created on to the photographs
so, i will select any of the ies lights, like any of them
so, i will select <?>select drive</?> and open it and after that close it
so, it’s not update in your view port as you can see
but if i increase the intensity little bit because ies lights need more intensity
ok
if i show you what you will get, let’s see
as you can see, your lights really changes
now, you have the triangulate look
ok so, and if you change, i want to change the colour, definitely you can
by simply going over here, just change the colour
that makes some different kind of shapes, so if you require to generate such kind of
ok like this you can work quite well
here you have maximum intensity, so if you want to just rotate it, you can definitely
rotate your light like this
so, you go down, what happens, see
the ground
so, like this way you can work quite well
so, we will discuss ies light in the exterior also
and, let’s meet to the next session
so, what happens now, what i will do, i will go to render settings and here will just off
shape in any three d application, we can use the ies profile lights over there
this and i will tell you the panels, how it’s working and after that we will just have to
light in the particular exterior scene
so, we have two buildings this and this one
and for that, what i will do, will go to rendering and i will just select the point light
so, the point light has formed and we have to align it at first and then we will go to
the render settings and here we have mental ray and here we have to check both of them
as we discussed earlier and in common tab we will just off this, make sure that it’s
off
so, now let’s switch to the maya application and have look how you can go up with ies profile
so, if you see here what happens if global illumination and final gather would be on?
both of them will just provide a softness into the light at its corners
the light will soft at its corners so it will form some gradient look
and in common, we have this enabled default light
if we enable this, the surrounding light will be on and it will not be in proper visible
so, we have to focus in the ies light only
so, i will just off this plus we don’t need background light and will off this
now, by selecting the light, you have the mental ray tab because we have switched the
render settings from maya software to mental ray
in maya software
so, you will get this mental ray tab if you will select the light here we have the mental
ray tab
so, if you click over here and if you go down, at first, before applying light profile, make
don’t require depth map, we don’t putting any map over here
we just require the proper ray trace shadow
ok so, we will just have the ray trace shadow and we don’t require the caustics and all
because we don’t have reflective surface here
it will ask you to upload the file name and the type of file
hi everyone
﻿hi everyone and welcome to this course so, today i will discuss ies light in this exterior
and control g, we have a group and we have the sunlight, which is here, we just grab this
let's have a look
as you can see cut as you can see the result is bouncing quite well if you focus in this part,
you can have a good view and if you want to change the direction you can just have a look now
so, have a look
as you can see, we have just focused only in one part and the bounciness the detail and the
look squad fine as you can see here also, it's quite looking amazing and also,
we have the dull sun so, if you have a look at your model,
you can have a good result by having the lights all over across your model to just work to set
just check this again, is it disabled or not ok fine now, we will go to indirect lighting and in
the lights like one by one, one by one so, that would look much more effective if you can just put
the lights in the window and nearby the window or the gate so, it will produce a good result
so, hope you understand the concept of ies lights and ok so, we will move further so,
you will have a practice and you can practice in this model that and you can practice in this type
of model if you want to practice and also, you just have to put the light and just play with the
intensity if you copy a particular light, you have to just go to its property panel and just
increase the intensity plus you have to just go to its light profile and just put the ies light
so, that would help and also you can download the ies light for free from net
and have work for the same cut and can work for the same
so, hope you enjoyed the session and let’s meet to the next session
indirect lighting you just have both of them checked- global illumination and final gather
so, we will cut this and now we will press seven for seven, we should have
this view for the lighting and after that, we will focus in this part only at first
so, we will go to attribute editor and in attribute editor at first let’s check the shadow
the shadow should be ray trace shadow ok so, we will go to the shadow, shadow parameters and
we will go to the ray trace shadow ok we will not increase the intensity right now we will increase
these later wards so, now as the shadow is on which is ray-traced shadow now, what we will do,
we will just go to the, here light profile so, in light profile, we have this
checker box and after that it will ask you to just upload the ies light the format is ies ok fine
so, let's continue so, as you know that i will go to render settings and in render settings in
we will click over here and we will go to the desktop and here we have the ies
so, we have this light open and now what happens if i just go to the render settings again,
because we are doing the testing so, we will go to common and in common we have the hd so
as you can see, we have just putted a simple light in the background, which is obviously
yeah, it has, but the intensity is quite low so, we will change the intensity and afterward,
we will just have a test render again so, what i will do, i will select the light and just
common tab here you have the render options so, i just enable disabled this by unchecking it if
and if you increase the intensity more, directly it will affect your light so, we will change
the intensity again so, as you can see, it’s forming now, we will increase the intensity
to twenty-five, i think that will be fine and if you see your render view, it is a very different
render, yeah, the render output would be very different as compared to this one
as you can see all the things is getting burned, but it doesn't happen in your render
so, as you can see the background you can use the physical sun and sky, so we have used the
physical sun and sky and also we can have the lighting like this, because we just have to
focus in the particular parts so that you may have the idea about the ies lights and all
if you want to change the colour, definitely you can you have the freedom to change the
you check it will enable, so i have just disabled it and i will just click this off and what i will
colour or you have the freedom to increase the intensity also so, if you just i will
increase intensity by thirty five and what i will do let's see thirty five ok fine and we
will duplicate this particular light to here but as we have discussed that if you duplicate any
light, the light profile will never been copied so we will copy it again and we will put some
other other ies light so, we will just select this one, and if i just select this light only
so, as you can see these parts inside it you can put everywhere if you need then you can just
have a normal lighting and just put it on the ies light because, without having normal light
you can put ies light, it will look not good because a little bit of environment light will
also be there then it will just produce a good result as you can see, both of them lights are
do, i will just go to the point light and we will select the point light we will move out here ok
different so, the shape is also different so, you can just put the shape according to your need,
as i have put it over like this shape as you can see, it’s bouncing quite well because
it has the depth and it has the detail, now it's bouncing quite well as you can see this area,
especially this position, this part, it's bouncing the light in a good way and by this
you can have the changing into the settings and after that you can quit your light quite well
and just put the light over here so that it may bounce very well and ok
so, the position of the light is also very important so, i will press five
select this part, we will put it somehow over here as, we have discussed that the light profile
will not copied, so we will just copy the same so, in this time i just use the
three loop umbrella and will change intensity at first let's see is it thirty-five?
control v,
light profile,
umbrella and have a look
as you can see, it’s not affecting your environment
and it's only affecting the model because the light the property of light has changed
so, as you can see it's bouncing quite well at the top if you just increase the gap
between the gap yeah if you cut if you increase the gap
between the light and the object, and it will bounce quite well but if you increase very much,
so, now as it moves, what we will do now before going to the attribute editor,
the light will just fade off so, we will increase accordingly so, that would be fine and
we will check it so, you can put all the lights in the pillar like this
that will look quite well
so, what i will do i will just select this and especially the three on,
and we will move little bit further
control d
we will go to the render setting again and here in the common tab we have enabled this default light
so, the spacing between the light and the object is very important if your light is
nearby the object then it will just produce a small structure, but if your light have
some amount of gap then it can be split but if you just move your light
so, let’s have a look
as you can see it is working quite well here you have the lights and this
is basically the plane the box, which we have created for the <?>crown</?>
so, if you want to delete the background light and just change and have little bit of dullness,
you can do it well and you have the lights, which is bouncing quite well
so, make sure that you're saving a new version and save it
going to the attribute editor, we will go to the render settings and after that what we will do,
so, if you want to change the colour of the background you can do it,
well and make sure that whenever you are lighting anything inside maya, you may have at least
to just make sure that you just have to check out your intensity level, that would be very
important if you check your intensity level, that would be very fine ok
so, that's very important to check your intensity level, and if you want to delete the background
light, you can do it well go to the rendered settings and all you have to just delete the
like area light, spotlight or even for the directional light and all
so, we will just delete this and we will create it again and if you off this it will go to the
display tab sorry window in outliner we have to the sun direct so, if you select all the lights,
we will go to the render using mental ray ok so, now if you go to mental ray, and
﻿hello everyone, welcome to the module number fourteen here we will learn about the getting
we will just increase the size little bit so, i will go to attribute editor by selecting it and
we will go to area light shape ok fine and here you have the area light
panel so, you can change the light type from here we will not change the light type, increase
the intensity, you can increase from here and you have all the features like in this section
and so you have mental ray so, you can go to use light shape, if i go here and just make a render
that's why it's casting so amount of light, we have to just
decrease the level of intensity by default, it is one point zero, but we have to just decrease
the level of intensity we
will decrease the intensity a little bit and, as you can see, our background is bluish kind of
thing so, we will change it to i think, which is contour colour, as compared to the blue and also,
we will learn about the process of image-based lighting inside maya application so, before going
one more thing is that i will just go to channel box and i will just on this thing we will
change the texture also from going to assign new material and here you have the mental ray
so, you have the material also, so you can use the mental ray materials but right now, i'm using
simple blinn and after using blinn what i will do, i will go to blinn and just use the colour like
this and if you are not finding your colour here, what you have to do,
we will go to polygon and here you have the normals you have the reverse
so, you can reverse your normal now, you can see it happened some time as you can see, here also
we have the same problem so, we will select this go to normals and you have the reverse, so you can
and just do some much more tweaking in this thing so, we will start working into <?>tweatik</?> as
to image-based lighting, what you have to do, just go to render settings and here you have the
you can see, this part is getting shadowed, which is good because we just use only one light now,
we will use two or more lights and we will just look at the render and
after that, we will increase the amount of final gather and global illumination
so, as we have applied the blinn, it's reflecting quite well so, we will not blow this thing
because it's morning and we don't require to blow all the things
so, what we will do, we will just click this off the thing and we will make some more lights
for little bit of bounciness and what i will do,
just go to the omni which is point light, click the point light and we have just found the point
light here and we will just move it around here we will make sure that you're saving your file,
because saving is very important and in this <?>control z will be here</?> and we will
render settings panel in render settings, here you have the option render using maya software
press seven for examine the light view as you can see, if you press seven,
you can go to the light view and i will change the colour to little bit of
bluish and we will change the intensity also, because we don't require this amount
of intensity and here you have the shadow panel so, in shadow, you have the shadow like
use ray trace shadow say it’s on, ok fine more things like ray depth shadow limits it will
light radius even you can also work with depth map shadow,
but we don't have any maps so, just put this off now, have a look before rendering the same,
what i will do, i will go to render settings and in common if you go here, you just find the
size, so i will just decrease this level of the size three twenty into two forty because
so, you just go to mental ray, and after going to mental ray just have all the features, which is
we have to examine it, after that when we do the final render, we will just increase the size by
going through ten eighty p which is full hd or even you can go to four k that will take around
huge amount of time so, we will just off this and we will do a test render
as you can see, the intensity is quite high so, we don't require this amount of intensity
plus, we also have to just work in this particular section of light so, we will select the light
and we will decrease the intensity a little bit i think we will just
judge that it is looking good or not if you are rendering the same, you can have the idea
specially for mental ray now, we will change to maya software
if you don't find your mental ray, then what you have to do, just go to window and here you have
the setting and preferences and here you have the plugin manager so, plugin manager, what does it
means? it means that all the plugins which are hidden in maya, you can just on it or off it,
according to your needs so, as you can see, the tick mark is basically which is on inside maya,
and the unchecked that means it is off in maya auto load means whenever you open the maya,
familiar with the ibl, that's the image-based lighting so, whatever the scene available
it will load that particular plugin so, if you are not finding the mental ray
on the render settings, what do you have to do? here you have the maya to mr dot bundle,
that means, you have to check both of them if this doesn't check, then it will not load
the same, if this doesn't check then it will not show on your render settings
so, maya to mr dot bundle is very important to check that particular thing if you want to work in
mental ray so, after switching to mental ray, you have all the features and one more thing is that,
so, we are using this simple interior and you can find this interior model in arnold
sessions so, we will just use this interior in arnold session also
so, at first what we have to do, we have just created a camera so, i will go to panel and
here you have the perspective and here you have the render underscore camera so, we have created
into the cc environment accordingly as per the environment, there should be some bounciness
the camera, and we have just set our render view now, we don't require this film grid
so, if you click over here, you have the film grid, just click and now it's fine because
in compositing software, you can add the film grid and here one more thing is that grid off,
because grid is getting distracted so, if you press spacebar and right mouse button by holding
right mouse button, you can go to perspective now, you have the freedom to rotate, and you can
check your render settings and render lights and all here so, i will just take some more space
because two is fine we will do the adjustment and we will just check from here we will just
print it from here so, before proceeding for the same one more thing is that make sure that
just select complete model including your camera and just make a new layer and just right click
and add to selected you can rename this layer, so i can rename it int interior,
available onto that model, which help us to look like that object would be available into the
ok save, just go to zero zero one, naming is very important
so, now you can hide your reference like this if you want to hide your reference, but yeah,
we have to do it so, i will just put r what r means that, means it is just reference the scene,
that means, you can select anything inside because it is converted into reference now,
what happens? see i will go to render settings and here you have the indirect
lighting system so, indirect lighting here you have both option, which is
image based lighting and physical sun and sky so, we will look both of them so, here you
have the image-based lighting so, image- based lighting, just click over here and just created
a dome as you can see here, it’s just created the dome, which is outside world so, now you
have the image so, i will call up a image and you should have at least hdri images for that ok
real-world environment for that, we should learn about the image-based lighting
so, as you can see, we have a couples of hdri images, and we will select any of them if you
just click over here, we have this image and if you just click over here, we have this image,
so you can download or even you can click with your camera so, we have these images and what
we will do? i will go to maya and we will choose the image and here, we in desktop
here we have the hdri images and here if you choose any of them, let's see what happens
if i select this open, now as you can see,
it just overlaps into your dome so, you can change the hdri,
by simply rotating it you can change the hdri by simply rotating it as you can see, it's changing
so, you can change it and now if you look at your room, what happens? let's see
here, the lighting and the dome is appearing so, if i press seven,
and here in this module we will also learn about the physical sun and sky, how we can create a
much and also, we have this roof which is black so, we have to just shut out it and
one more thing is that we will just go to six just press the six and just
go through here here you find that this part is getting darker so, what we will do,
we will just go to channel box and we will on the reference
now, by selecting the hdri image and one more thing is that
i will just go to the render settings and in indirect lighting, here you have
the common parameters where it is? so, as you can go over here, we have the common parameters,
which is just beside it and in common parameters you have the render options
so, here you have the render options in render options, you have to just uncheck enable default
realistic physical sun lighting in three d application in maya application here
light so, what happens let's have a look as you can see, the default light which is present in
maya is off now, the image which is outside is casting some sort of light from here you can
just increase or decrease the level of exposure, but i will just put for the time zero and now what
happens next, i just minimize it now, you have to select the dome
and if by selecting the dome, you can go to attribute editor
and here you have the detail of all the things so, you have all the things like advance,
you have legacy and you can go to mental ray and you can have the transform and all ok
so, by selecting this light, and one more thing, we go to render setting again and in indirect
lighting panel, we have to check the final gather, which is here, we will check the final gather
and i think we should increase the global illumination by checking it,
now, let’s switch to the maya and have look how we can create a photorealistic physical sun-based
final gather map we don't require final gather ok now, have a look
so, as you can see your sample is not good at this time, and it needs some amount of light also
for illuminating the same so, by having only one light, you can't even do all the scene lighting
because you need some more additional lights for the same so, for that what we have to do?
we will just go to here and we will just select the box and will not select the dome, will select
only the box and we will go to channel box and we will just turn the reference <?>on</?> so,
we will press f for fit to screen now, you can select, i will press four now,
you have a better look and we will change and we will apply few of the lights here also
so, here you have the rendering tab and i will also open the rendering tab here and you have
the lighting features so, it depends on you if you select any of the panel it will show its
lighting and image-based lighting scene setup in maya application
property feature at the top so, in rendering panel, you have the area light which is here
if i click here, now our area light has formed we can see
so, we have to increase the size of the area light as we will just go over here and we will
focus on the same if you rotate this see your x value is changing, so we need minus one eighty
and after that
here, and we will increase the size we will go to five pressing and we will see
so, what we will do, we will just pass through the, i think the part would be fine
yeah, we will pass through the window and just have little bit of modifications
so, at first, i will save my file so, we will go to file and save as
what we will do, we will just select the light and move forward
hello, everyone, and welcome to this course of maya image-based lighting so, in this session,
