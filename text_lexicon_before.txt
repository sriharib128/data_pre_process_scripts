distributors, retailers, and consumers who are linked through
flow of products and services, information and funds to meet
the customer needs or rather a dream  A supply chain is a
collection of suppliers linked to create one specific product
or service for a company  Every product has its own supply chain 
Those certain suppliers are linked for multiple products 
It is a chain or network of nodes or links,
which include multiple suppliers, manufacturers
and subcontractors, warehouses, distribution centers, and stores
where the consumer can purchase the products  Each link in the
cup of coffee  You walk to the kitchen shelf, take the coffee
supply chain is sequenced in a specific direction and order 
Each link in supply chain adds time cost and customer service 
It involves human interfaces, digital integration and
logistics partnership  Supply chains are complicated and when
managed well lead to competitive advantage  To ensure effective
control over supplies, value chain and customer service,
the supply chain can be integrated either vertically
or horizontally or both  Benchmarking best practices
and following them leads to sustainable supply chains 
So, with a hope that you all have understood the concept of supply
powder, sugar and milk from the refrigerator  You switch on the
chain and now to trigger your thinking, I asked you these two
questions from your experience as a customer, they picked a
supply chain and name the brand you like and sketch the supply
chain for it  Awaiting for your answer 
This is Dr  P  Chitramani signing off with a cup of coffee

stove, set the water to boil and follow the process to make
coffee  With a cup of coffee you wonder what it takes to get
a cup of coffee in the morning? Then comes the Supply Chain 
Let us consider the raw materials for processing a cup of coffee 
Namely the cooking gas, utensil water, milk, sugar and coffee powder 
Moving backward as a customer you can identify the
primary supply chains that is needed to get a cup of coffee 
Cooking gas is got at your door friend from the gas agent,
Administration, Avinashilingam Institute for Home Science and Higher
who in turn gets it from the regional gas depos of oil corporations 
Utensil is got from the supermarkets that
procure from private label utensil makers, who depend on
foundries, steel and plastic suppliers for raw materials 
Water at home flows from the regional water tanks, which
store and supply water got from the city tanks, dams and various
water resources  Milk is got from the local Kirana shop who
replenish daily stock from milk processing units, who get milk
from the societies and dairy farmers  Sugars journey to your
cup starts from the sugarcane farmers to the sugarcane

procurement societies through the sugarcane factories and the
public distribution systems  coffee powder is got from your
local retailer who gets coffee beans from the coffee booths, rose
the beans and powder it  The Coffee Board intern by the
coffee beans from the local coffee plantations of farmers 
In short, Supply Chain is a process that satisfies a
customer need and consists of multiple entities that are
linked through flow of products, information and funds 
Transferring the experience of coffee at home to the world

Dear learners, welcome you all to the first
business sense  Starbucks Corporation with more than
24,000 stores in 70 countries starts the journey of customer
fulfillment with a cup of coffee across the world with its
hand picked coffee beans, and other merchandises source across the Globe 
The goal of Starbucks supply chain is to reduce costs
and improve efficiency  It follows a plan, source, make

reorganize to centralize its fragmented supply chain, cut
costs and improved services, designed supply chains to meet
its future capabilities  As a sustainable sourcing strategy,
Starbucks worked directly with its nearly 300,000 coffee
growers who meet the Starbucks coffee and farmers equity
standards and coffee sourcing guidelineses  Starbucks
interaction with the farmers ensured that coffee beans are of
the same quality and flavor  This empowers the suppliers to
meet quality standards, ethical standards, like protecting
workers rights and human working conditions,
focuses on what is supply chain? The learning objective is to
sustainability through social responsibility 
The handpicked coffee beans generally sourced from
Latin America, Africa and Asia are
shipped in ocean containers to its six company owned coffee
roasting plants in USA and Europe, referred to as greenhouses 
The beans are roasted and packed in the coffee roasting plants 
The company also relies on 24 co-manufactures
in United States, Canada, Europe, Asia and Latin
America  One world, one logistics systems of Starbucks reduce the
transportation and logistics cost and increased efficiency 
provide a customer view of Supply Chain and to link it to
After the coffee bean is roasted and packed, it is transported to
regional distribution centers  Starbuck has five in USA, of
which three is owned by Starbucks and two are third party
logistics companies  Two third party logistics companies in
Europe and two third party logistics companies in Asia 
The regional distribution centers carry everything that the
Starbucks stores need from furniture to cappuccino cups 
The regional distribution centers supply directly to the
stores if it has a locational advantage  If not, the stores
are supplied from third party central distributional centers 
the organizational perspective  What is Supply Chain? Supply
Starbucks uses 33 third party central distribution centers in
USA, seven in Asia's pacific region and three in Europe and all
are well connected to the regional distribution centers 
Their effective communication and storecard assessment ensure
consistency, on time delivery, reducing end to end supply costs
and enhanced enterprise efficiency  Further, Starbucks is
vertically integrated to provide the customer delight 
Starbucks is integrated backward through purchase agreements with coffee
growers, company owned bean roasting plants, company owned
warehousing and distribution facilities and company owned

Dear all I hope you enjoyed the learning experience
What is integrated supply chain management? Integrated supply
chain management is about integrating the supply chain
process namely plan, source, make and deliver  In the words of WPK
integrated supply chain management as a process of
linking the functions of buy it, make it, move it,
sell it and service it  In short integrated supply chain
management is a process that links the plan, source, make,
deliver functions to provide efficent and responsive services to the customers 
Now, let us understand the process of
integrated supply chain management  By understanding the

supply chain of Amul, The Taste of India, Amul, The Taste
of India was launched in 1946 by Gujarat Co-Operative Federation
and has created the white revolution in India and it
focuses on quality, value for money, availability and service to the customers 
The supply chain management process of
Amul can be explained as follows: By it dairy farmers in
villageres supply milk to village cooperative societies
and village cooperative societies transport the milk to
district unions  Milk is pasteurized in the district unions
and transported to state cooperative marketing federation factories
identify the supply chain that satisfied you as a customer
where dairy products are manufactured and branded 
Move it and marketed involved products are transport to various
wholesale and retail stores  Amul has an extended supply chain to
Amul food factory, reverse logistics to return milk
and other damaged products to the dairy is effective in Amul 
Let us map each of the processes  The upstream supply
chain of Amul list of farmers and village cooperatives societies 
Every farmer who supplies milk to Amul is given
a plastic card for identification 
Farmers identification number is captured and transmitted to
and to identify your favorite brand and its supply chain to reach you 
local PC, milk is weight and fat content measured 
The amount due to the farmers is calculated based on the fat content
and the value of the milk is printed in the slip
and the farmers collect the payment 
Village cooperative societies in turn
provide cattle feed, veterinary services and rural health
schemes to ensure quality of milk and suppliable being 
The process that Amul from supplier identification to payment is
digitally integrated with automatic milk collection unit systems 
Amul has integrated geographic information system
And with a bit of moving across your memory lane on what is supply chain,
for tracking of milk at the village collection center 
The dairy information and service chaos establishes a good
supplier relationship  It provides information to the
farmers to improve cattle yield and connects them to procure
and to collaborate with dairy products and services suppliers 
Make it and move it  The internal supply chain of make it
starts with the milk being received at district milk unions
with chilling plants and functions as follows: Amuls
chillers are strategically located in proximity to the villages 
Delivery to the district unions is through insulated rail
Let us move on to the next session on integrated
tankers and chilled trucks  Amul facilitates prompt
transportation to district facilities and further
dispatches it to customers or processing units  And electronic
systems to track inventory, provide information for
replenishments schedules  Gujarat Cooperative Federation has
strategic tie up with IBM to implement SAP PRP on IBM technologies 
This will digitally connect end to end
business processes and ensure effective supply chain performance 
Process three, move it and sell it  Downstream
supply chain or formal is as follows: Processed milk and
supply chain management  Supply chain is how you plan, source, make
dairy products move from the dairy unions to Gujarat
cooperative milk marketing federation limited owned
warehouses, orders are received by GCMMF  Amul has a three tier
downstream flow from manufacturing unit to company
depos from company depos to wholesale depos
and wholesale depos to retailers or Amul utterly delicious
parlours and franchises  Amul markets its products through
its 56 sales offices, and a network of 10,000 dealers
and hundred thousand retailers  Logistic decisions for
distribution is controlled and transportation cost is borne by GCMMF 
and deliver the product and services by linking suppliers, distributors,
It also monitors suppliers of milk
and distributors of finished goods and services 
Effective reverse logistics minimizes cost 
Amul has established a B2B and B2C portal
that links its supplier, partners, distributors
and customers and it le sells all its product through cybersource
process for integrated  Amul has a cooperative society
has integrated its supply chain effectively,
both vertically and horizontally

how successfully the supermarket and the local fruit stall
leverages the market condition  The local fruit seller can
leverage on replenish to sale from local markets, less
inventory or logistics and storage cost,
forward integration to reduce wastage, compete on price rather than
product or service differentiation  The supermarket
can leverage on economies of scale, bulk purchase and bulk
selling, improved customer service and customer value,
backward integration and outsourcing  Supply chain
supply chain models  Supply chain is a sequence of functions and
management decision is based on what should be the supply chain aim
at, efficiency, responsiveness or both  Supply chains oriented
towards efficiency, aim at low cost supply chain, high
utilization of assets, reduce lead time and wastage 
The three types of supply chain models that are best suited
for end to end efficiency are efficient supply chain model,
the fast supply chain model, continuous supply chain model  Efficiency
oriented supply chain models are applicable when demand has
become more certain and supply is predictable  Margins are lower
under intense competition and prices influence consumer choice 
activities involved in delivering a product or service 
Supply chains oriented towards responsiveness, on the other
hand aim at meeting, changing customer needs, shortening lead
time, respond to innovative products and variety seeking
customers, high service quality  The two types of supply chain
models that are oriented towards responsiveness are agile
supply chain models and custom configured supply chain model 
Responsive models are suitable when demand is uncertain, firms
earn high margins when demand meet supply, product innovation,
variety and the availability attracts customers, cost is a
secondary consideration  In short, the objectives of the
It is a complex network of organizations who supply partner
supply chain are to ensure continuity in production
and delivery of products to the customer 
Reduce cost and maximize asset utilization, provide better
value for the product by reducing costs and increasing
customer experience, respond quickly to market changes,
innovate new products and processes to meet customer
needs and improve quality of products and services 
These objectives can be achieved by designing supply chains to be
efficient and responsive to the demand conditions 
To conclude, the objectives of any supply chain are to optimize the 7Rs
and collaborate to fulfill a customers need 
that is providing the right customer the right product of
the right quantity at the right place in the right condition at
the right price and at the right time  And maximizing the supply
chain surplus and balancing efficiency and effectiveness of supply chain 
These objectives of supply chain help in decision
of which supply chain model to offer in a given market condition 
And the two noteworthy points are strategic
choice of efficiency oriented supply chain model,
or responsive oriented supply chain models depend on the type of
industry, competition and customer choice  To achieve strategic fit
This is also referred to as value chain consisting of three paths,
the supply chain model can be shifted from one
type to the other as the product moves through the product life cycle
and when the demand supply characteristics change  points to ponder 
Three examples of a well known supply chain masters, namely
Walmart, Amazon, and Telsa quoted from smart street in USA,
is presented for you as transcripts on reading the brief
on the supply chain innovations comment on the following: What is
the supply chain model that these firms have followed?
And how are they different? Explain how they have balanced
efficiency and responsiveness of supply chain 
namely upstream supply chain, manufacturing and operations
Thank you learners and have a thoughtful day
and ponder on the goals and strategies of supply chain management 
logistics, downstream supply chain outbound logistics 
Supply chain function determines the success and failure of an
organization as it is customer centric and directed towards
customer satisfaction  What then should be the objectives of
Dear learners on completion of the lessons on supply chain
supply chain and supply chain management? Imagine you're
arriving home late and you want a quick dinner, you call a home
service and order your dinner  The moment you place your order
the supply chain process starts and it ends when you receive the
order but the success of supply chain is achieved if you have
received the order as specified by you  The food is tasty
and fresh and if it reached you within the time anticipated
and made you feel you have not paid more for the service 
From the customer perspective and the organizational perspective,
the goal of supply chain is to optimize the 7Rs namely
and integrated supply chain management, let us move on to
providing to the right customer, the right product, of the right
quantity, at the right place, in the right condition, at the right
time and at the right price  And this is possible only through
integrated processes that ensure effective flow of products,
informations and funds  From the organizational perspective
the goal of supply chain is to optimize the seven 7Rs at the
least cost and minimum lead time 
This is financially termed as Supply Chain Surplus 
The objective of every supply chain is to maximize
the overall value generated or supply chain surplus  Supply
understand the goals and strategies of supply chains 
chain surplus is equal to customer value minus supply chain cost 
Customer value is the revenue generated from the customers
and the sources customer supply chain cost
involves cost of flow of product or service, information and funds 
Effective supply chains are achieved by managing supply
chain assets, products, information and fund flow to
maximize supply chain surplus  The supply chain decisions focus
on responsive deliveries at the lowest cost and the supply chain
decision in connection with supply chain surplus should be
viewed from the customer perspective 
This lesson focuses on comprehending the objectives of
Explaining this with an example of two occasions
when a customer wants to buy a kg of apples 
Occasion one is he visits the supermarket
with his family and picks 1 kg of apple  Occasion two is,
he visits his friend in the hospital and buys a kilo of
apple from the juice shop near the hospital with little
differentiation in the quality of apple, what is the impact of
this on supply chain decisions? let us calculate the supply
chain surplus for a kg of apple in these two occasions 
Occasion one going with the family to the supermarket
supply chain, supply chain surplus and strategic selection of
on sunday and buying a kg of apple 
As we have noted earlier supply chain surplus is
equal to customer value minus supply chain cost  And what is it
for a kg of apple in a supermarket? The customer has
gone to the supermarket to spend some family time and at the same
time complete the task of replenishing his monthly stock
and hence, customer value is what a customer
is willing to pay for a product and his buying experience 
Customer value is equal to sum of customer value
for one kg of apple label on the apple, convenience, family time,
supply chain models  The learning outcome of this lecture
luxury enjoyed and loyalty, store atmosphere and experience 
Let us assumed the customer value as rupees 150 per kg 
Supply chain cost is equal to supply chain cost of
procurement, cost of three tier supply chain, transportation
cost, preservation and storage cost, inventory and other
resource cost, store expenses, wastage and reverse
logistics cost and taxation  Let us assume that it as 120 per kg 
The supply chain surplus is equal to 150 minus 120
that is 30 rupees  Occasion two customer visiting his friend in the
hospital and buying a kg of apple at a local fruit stall near the hospital 
is you will be able to identify the goals of supply chain of
What is the supply chain surplus for a kg of
apple in the local shop near the hospital? The customer has gone
to the hospital and now buys the apple based on the availability
and proximity to purchase  And hence customer value is equal to
the sum a customer is willing to pay for the product and his
buying experience that is sum of customer value for one kg of
apple, quality, convenience, quick purchase and proximity 
Let us assume the customer value is rupees 120 per kg  Supply
chain cost is the sum of cost of procurement at single tier
supply chain, short distance transportation cost,
various organizations and the related supply chain models You
replenishment cost and minimum reverse logistics  Let us assume
that to be rupees 80 per kg  The supply chain surplus per kg is
equal to rupees 120 minus rupees 80 that is rupees 40 
Comparing the supply chain surplus of supermarket and local fruit
stall the surplus is more with the local fruit stall 
What does this mean? Does it mean that the supply chain of the local food
stall is more competitive than the supermarkets? In the real sense
apart from the profits, the competitiveness of the
supply chain is determined by how effective and how responsive
the supply chain is to meet the customer requirement

Dear learners to conclude we need to understand that
industries today function in dynamic business environments
and firms who are proactive to the changes are competitive 
These firms extend their proactive strategies to their supply
partners, distribution, network and consumers  And supply chain
management links and leverages the firm's competitiveness with
the supplier and distributor to meet the customer needs
The learning objectives are to outline the business environment factors

The forces in the business environment that impact the
competitiveness of an industry are regulatory

exchange rates, unemployment rates, and economic recession or depression 
The social environment is created by the
Business environment and business operations do not function in isolation 
members of the society to which you and I
belong and also your customers belong 
The social environment is reflected as values, beliefs,

Michael Porter advocates that competitive
the cost escalation and productivity efficiency due to technological
changes all indicate that there are changes in the business environment 
In simple words, each operation or activity of a

sector, the impact of environmental economics on
natural resources, renewable energy and carbon footprints
indicate the need for resource substitutes and processes that are sustainable 
The social environment that impacts today's
housing sector are the existence of nuclear families and demand for
small houses, high mobility and nuclear families have led to
lack of social networks and demand community housing with
proximity to all facilities and safety  Changing consumption
patterns indicate a house as a luxury with unique interiors,
home furniture and appliances  The environment and health
environment and supply chain competitiveness aims to address
consciousness of the consumers create demand for
facilities like walking space, gym, kitchen garden, renewable
energy sources, and so on within the community 
Technological impact is found in the raw materials used and the processes
of construction, digitally integrated smart houses that
ensure safety and communication facilities, renewable energy
resources that can be recycled or the need of the hour 
In this scenario, what is expected by the customer is a
unique house with all facilities at an optimal price 
Since the end to end processes are standardized and transparent,
the questions when and how firms in an industry innovate and
and investment high, the customers expect the houses to
be handed over within a period of 6 to 12 months 
To a constructor it means the project of building the community
house with all inbuilt facilities without delay,
and it involves huge investment  And this is where supply chain
management becomes a strategic tool for competitive advantage 
What should supply chains do to cope up with such situations?

supply chain management in creating customer value 
The learning objectives of this session is to provide
an understanding on value creation and value chain and illustrate the
contribution of supply chain management in customer value creation 
The learning outcome on completion of this course is,
one can understand the strategic importance of supply chain to
create customer value  Welcome you all to a session on
customer value creation through strategic supply chain management 
What is a customer value? We are all consumers and if I ask you,
Hi all and welcome to the last part of competitive
what is the value assigned to the car that you want to own?
And the one that you dream of? What will you tell?
Iam sure each one of you will name the brand that is favorite to you 
And when asked Why do you think so? I am sure you will list the
benefits you enjoyed and you anticipated and you would also
make a reference to the price the cost of the car and whether
it is cheap or whether it is worth the price you paid  There
now you have have an answer  Yes, customer value is the
satisfaction that the customer enjoys in relation to the cost
of the product or service  What do firms do to create value
advantage of supply chain management  I start this session
and capture the competitive positions? Firms just do not
sell products or services but in reality, they provide bundles
of differentiated benefits through their value-added
products and services at a very competitive price  To achieve
this, the firm's strive for low cost leadership, differentiation
or focus differentiation  The firms today have realized that
the combination of low cost and differentiated services create
that customer value that the firm wants to create 
And these firms continuously work towards two areas, one is cost
reduction, and the next is quality improvement 
on strategic supply chain with few questions for you to answer
The competitive firms have realized that operational efficiency
across the supply chain operations create customer value 
This induced me to answer the question can supply chain
management be that core processes that can create
customer value? And I got the answer as "yes", from the video of
Professor Ananth Iyer who has co- authored the book on Toyota
supply chain and I will discuss some of their ideas on how and
what the supply chain processes can do to create customer value 
As we all know Toyota is a global company that sells its
various brands across the world, And the supply chain management
and they are: What brands come to your mind when I say computers,
there can be explained with an acronym that is coined by the
authors of the book 'Toyota Supply Chain Management' 
In their words, supply chain management at Toyota is about V4L 
Where V1 is the velocity that is the speed at
which the products are manufactured 
V2 is the variability, the fluctuation in the sales at every detail level 
And V3 is the visibility, the visibility of the product
flow to everyone involved in the process, and V4 is variety 
This is a key focus and it indicates varity of the
products sold, products sold at various occasions and the
mobile phones and why did you buy it? And what is your retail
interactions of variety with the cost  Toyota directs the supply
chain plans across these four Vs at individual car levels
and L indicates learning  The success of supply chain at
Toyota is the process, the process of learning 
At Toyota learning happens at all levels  The employees are empowered to
identify problems, fix problems and initiate changes and this
empowerment is extended to the suppliers, distributors and the customers 
The idea from all can be incorporated into the process
but the process is still stable without any chaos 
Process being the key there does not only fixed
outlet that is favorite to you, your food joint, your dream car
problems, but it provides results or solutions that are repeatable 
The key points from Toyota supply chain process
that help other firms to design supply chains that have a
strategic fit are: The supply chain is tuned to maximize
customer satisfaction and everything else is a constraint 
Customer centric supply chains focus on planning the 4Vs
namely velocity, variability, visibility and varity
at individual product levels  Detailing at individual product
levels held to think of customers satisfaction and the related
cost at individual customer level  Process is the key at
or a bike and so on  I am sure you would name that brand that
Toyota and it reflects the power of learning  Empowered employees
and incorporating suggestions from at all levels from supplier to
the customers into the process results in cost reduction
and quality improvement  Supply chain process
interact with the business environment and the confidence that the process
would work during crisis is the key to improve fixed problems
and bring in changes in the involvement of all the
stakeholders of supply chain  Designing and extending supply
chains that can connect the customers to the supply chain
process, help, get suggestions on design changes, quality issues,
satisfied you or the one that is anticipated to satisfy you is?
and many more  The core take away from Toyotas cases, the main
driver of a supply chain is link between the variety
and supply chain cost  Supply chain processes with strategic fit
should support firms to select the right level of variety of
products that deliver performance  In short supply
chain management is a tool to gain competitive advantage 
One key supply chain performance measure is customer value
created through supply chains  The strategic fit of supply
chain is achieved when the supply chains can maximize
customer satisfaction, and minimize costs and when the

opportunities of supply chain we will end this lesson by
pinpointing six drivers of supply chain and the framework
of supply chain decision making  The six drivers of supply chain
are facilities, physical location of production sites
and storage sites  Inventory is raw materials, work in progress
and finished goods along the supply chain 
Transportation indicates modes and routes of moving inventory from one point
of the supply chain to the other  Information, data, reports and
analytics about every component of the supply chain is indicated
as information  Sourcing: firms decision about whether the
impellers, challenges and drivers of supply chain 
supply chain activity should be carried out inhouse or should
it collaborate with the partners who perform a particular supply chain activity?
The activities include production, supply of
goods and services, storage, logistics or transportation
and many more  Pricing: Pricing indicates the firms monetary
value for products and services in its supply chain 
The supply chain decision framework is as follows:
The logistical drivers namely facilities, inventory and transportation
and the cross functional drivers, information, sourcing and pricing will
determine the nature of supply chain structure  That is the
The learning objective of this session is to identify the impellers and
extent of efficiency and responsiveness that align with
the supply chain strategy and competitive strategy 
Hope you all understood the drivers and challenges in supply chain 
The forth coming sessions will discuss each of the decision
framework components in detail 
Thank you and a practical exercise for you:
Identify the supply chain of any popular
manufacturer, brand or retail outlet and list the impellers
and uncertainties faced by the organization 
Pinpoint three solutions provided by them to meet the opportunities
uncertainties in supply chain and drivers of supply chain 
and challenges in supply chain 
Thank you 
Music
The learning outcome is by the end of the session, you will be
able to link the logistical and cross functional drivers to
leverage the impellers and overcome the uncertainties 
We will look into the impellers  In today's markets,
organizations strive to maximize their profits by sustaining
customer satisfaction and leveraging their supply chain to
meet the market forces  For this the supply chain managers ask some questions 
Dear learners, welcome you all to a session on Drivers and
The questions are: Will changing customers
and market space influence supply chain performance?
Will globalization impact supply chain performance? And will
technology change the way supply chains can be leveraged for competitive advantage?
These questions have identified three
major impellers of supply chains as customers and markets,
globalization, technology  We will look into the customers
and markets The customer and market forces that accelerates the
supply chain functions are empowered information rich
customers, variety and quality seeking customers,
Challenges of supply chain  The functions of supply chain and
demand for value in products and services,
power shift to customers, hyper competitive market, breakthrough
and innovative products and services, technology embedded
products, environmentally friendly customers and organizations 
These forces propel organizations to implement
responsive, cost efficient and sustainable supply chains 
Globalization, the global business environment is
characterized by globally operating companies, dispersed
markets, manufacturing facilities and sourcing opportunities 
Increased geographical scope of business operations
the strategic importance of supply chain as discussed in
and global distribution and channel partners 
Outsourced service providers are common in global environment 
This global supply chain has propelled optimisation
of global supply chains that can overcome the international trade
barriers and minimize cost and time  What has this done to supply chains?
This has led to supply chain strategies like
rapid demand forecasting, outsourcing and global logistics management 
We will move on to understand the impact of
technology developments on supply chain  In supply chain
management, technology is an impeller as it is a means
the previous sessions indicates that supply chain is a core
to automate and reduce manufacturing cycle time,
access real time data to overcome supply chain uncertainties,
ensure visibility across supply chain, simplify supply chain by
eliminating unnecessary links and reduced wastage,
enhanced communication across extended supply chain 
These requirements has led to the implementation of technology enabled
supply chain tools like material requirement planning, manufacturing
resource planning, enterprise resource planning, vendor
managed inventory, total assets visibility, velocity
manufacturing and point of sales data capture tools like RFID 
function from a customer and organizational perspective
some of the latest supply chain technology trends are
industrial robotics, multi dimensional printers and additive
manufacturing, analytics and artificial intelligence,
internet of things and big data, blockchain, drones and driver less
vehicles, immersive technology like virtual reality  With the
market forces and technology propelling the supply chains,
the supply chains of successful brands looks seamless 
But is this true? In reality supply chain managers face and overcome
supply chain uncertainties? The supply chain uncertainties are
unpredictable or sudden changes in the business conditions,
and supply chain management is a core function to achieve
government regulations and competitive conditions,
the supplier network and the environmental considerations 
So, what are the three types of supply chain uncertainties?
The three types of supply chain uncertainties are: Supply
uncertainity, process uncertainty and demand uncertainty 
The supply uncertainty is related to the uncertainty in resource
supply and this may be due to: Non availability of resources,
insufficient supply capacity, fluctuations in material price,
uncertain supply lead times, lack of flexibility in production or
use of resources, third party transportation and logistics issues 
competitive advantage  Having understood the integrated supply
We will move on to process uncertainties 
Process uncertainty is related to the likely disruption
in the manufacturing process,
due to machine non availability, labour issue, instable working capital,
manufacturing and information technology problems,
transportation and material handling issues 
Demand uncertainty  Supply chain managers aim to meet the
customer demands  The demand uncertainty is the change in the
customer demand caused by changes in customer needs and in
qualtity required, expectation of short lead time, increase in
chain management process, its goals and strategies and the
variety of products, multiple options of distribution channel
and payment modes, innovations leading to new products and
product versions, retailing scenario and virtual market space 
These impellers and uncertainties are met by the
organizations with flexibility in supply chains supported by
collaborative production planning of supply chain, demand
forecasting and supply network management, demand driven
strategies, MRP with uncertainity, just in time inventory or
integrated safety stock, multiple sourcing techniques
and optimization of stock  On knowing the challenges and
strategic importance, we will move on to understanding the
Hi, learners welcome you all to a lesson on strategic sourcing 
bought, if the firm decides to make when and where should the
product be manufactured and kept available is the
decision of supply chain  If the firm decides to buy the decision
areas are, should the supply base consists of single source or
multiple source, local, regional or international suppliers,
subcontractors, retailers, distributors or wholesalers,
small scale manufacturers or large scale manufacturers 
Each category of suppliers have their pros and cons and the decision
is based on the category profile, specialized services, quality
assurance, and lead time  For supplier selection, market
total cost of product ownership,
information is gathered across the supplier capabilities 
The activities are request for information,
the request for Information referred to as (RFI)
seeks information on: Product specification and know how,
quality and operational policies, financial stability, service level
acceptance, country of origin and manufacturer, and client preferences 
The next step is to review the supplier
and solicit request for proposal 
To review the supplier, the market information
and data from request for information is matched
long-term partnership with suppliers, value addition through
with the category profile and sourcing strategy or request for
proposal is solicited to assess the pricing and
commercials from potential suppliers  Supplier profile is
matched for production categories  Supplier evaluation and selection 
The supplier is evaluated based on total cost of
ownership which includes purchase cost, operating cost,
maintenance cost, training cost, logistics, less salvage value 
Total system cost is the total cost of doing business with the supplier 
This includes supplier costs and profits, interaction
cost and buyer costs  Performance metrics include
procurement of best products and services 
product specification and quality metrics, responses to
request, delivery accuracy, and warranty clarity and execution
and customer satisfaction  Request for quotation is
encourage at this stage to ensure the value and negotiation is carried out 
The selection of the supplier is based on the: Best value,
continuous improvement policies,
and innovations from the supplier  Next is how to
maintain supplier relationship management  The important
function in strategic sourcing is to establish long term
relationship with the suppliers  This can be done by: Establishing
Let us briefly understand the
good working relationship, ensuring trust during
negotiations, effective contract management processes,
and follow the principle of Keiretsu and develop network
composed of manufacturers, supply chain partners, distributors, who
work closely together to ensure product innovation and development 
Thank you, and we will meet in the next class on purchase activities 
strategic sourcing process  Sourcing is the process of
identification, selection and development of supplier network 
The process of strategic sourcing is addressed as three
major areas of procurement namely
Need analysis, total spend analysis, category
profiling, organizations create category profile 
In the last session, we discussed the procurement management and
What resources are sourced? The decision involves should the
organization make or buy? Sort resources needed as categories
and follows sourcing strategies  At this point
organizations design sourcing strategies for every material
or component needed based on the category profile 
The third is from whom to source?
Create a supply base, where can the resources be obtain, from
whom can the resources be obtain and how to ensure supplies,
organizations create supplier profile and processes
and link them to the materials
it's link with supply chain  Traditionally, procurement was
and components in this phase  Let us discuss and
understand each phase one by one, phase one, resource
requirement identification or what resources are needed?
Procurement and sourcing are triggered when the organization
stimulates the need for materials, components,
and services based on demand forecasting and production plans
or new product develpment  This phase consists of three steps 
The first is need analysis  Need analysis identifies
the materials and components needed to meet the demand for the
product and services  The new product development and specific
viewed as a transactional process from issue of purchase order, order confirmation,
materials and components needed  Any product enhancements and
change in specifications of the material and components needed 
The next is total spend analysis 
Spend analysis identifies the areas of cost reduction from the
expenditure data across the organization  Procurement is a
cost center and the total cost of ownership includes not only
the purchase price, but also the hidden acquisition cost 
Total spend analysis helps to identify areas to decrease procurement
and process cost  Spend analysis categorizes resources based on
volume and the value  Profile the category, the two step process
and follow up material receipt and payment  But contemporary
that can be followed for category profiling are
prepare bill of material
and categorize the resource requirement
at multiple levels  Bill of material is a complete set of
items required to develop the product to specification of the consumer 
The items for building a material includes raw
materials, components, assembled products in specific quantities 
On identification of the need and spend areas
the finalized resource requirement is categorized based on product
category, quantity use, types and sizes  It is also grouped
procurement focuses on optimizing the supply base
across the products, users, location processes, and the members 
For example, the bill of material for manufacture of
the shirt will include: Fabrics ribs, buttons, threads, labels for
the size, hang tags, packing bags with specifications of
quantity for each type of shirt 
The category profile for the shirt can
be develop based on the fabric used, product type that is formal
or casual, fabric type that is cotton or woollen,
clients specifications that is routine, new or branded clients, and location 
Phase two of strategic sourcing is category profiling
through collaborative approach and continuous improvement 
and sourcing strategy  What resources are sourced?
The decision on what resources are to be sourced depends on two
operations namely, make or buy decision and creating sourcing
strategies based on category profile  When to make and when
to buy the product? Makers favorable when agency
cost is less, quality, design, secrecy, patent and
proprietorship need to be protected, suppliers are not
reliable and incompetent, leveraging excess capacity
or backward integration, lead time and logistics advantage 
Buyers favorable when transaction cost is less, firm lack expertise,
What is strategic sourcing?
multiple specialized and committed suppliers are available,
leveraging limited capacity and workforce instability,
specialized low volume and supplier partnership advantages 
The resources needed are categorized
to create category profile and link it  to the sourcing strategy 
The resources needed are categorized based on supplier
risk and procurement value
as routine leverage bottleneck and strategic products 
The sourcing strategies for these products categories are: General
system of subcontracting for routine products, competitive
Strategic sourcing is a component of supply chain
bidding for leverage products, performance based contract for
bottleneck products and collaborative supply chain
for strategic products  The deliverable of this phase is
organizations decide on the sourcing strategy for every
material or component needed based on the category profile 
The third phase in strategic sourcing is supplier profile and
supplier relationship management  The phase provides
answers to: From where the resources can be obtained? From
whom it can be obtained? And how to ensure supplies?
Creating a supply base involves, if the products are being made or
that focuses on: Continuous improvement of the purchase activities,
Dear learners in this lesson we will discuss series of
purchasing cycle and consists of the following: Recognize and
describe the need, stock check, prepare supplier list, request
for proposal and quotation, issue purchase order, acceptance
and acknowledgement of order by the supplier follow up,
receipt and inspection, invoice check and completion of order 
We will look into the steps one by one  The first step, recognize and
describe the need starts or is triggered when by the firms
department or its stores section  The need is notified by
either a standard purchase requisition or and material
requirement planning  If the need is a one-time purchase,
activities to be taken up to complete procurement 
then an engineering bill of material is used 
The requisition is an internal document and most companies use
a standard format  The user generally makes minimum of two
copies, one for the purchase department and the other for the
user department file  Normally the information in the form are
the descriptions of the material, quantity and the date required,
estimated unit cost and the authorized signature 
Once the requisition is received, it is checked to see if the item is in stock 
Today it is easily possible to verify stocks with
computer systems in place  Firms load the information and prices
This series of actions are termed as purchase procedure 
for the commonly used materials on to the server 
And user then make requisitions electronically 
Programmed inventory monitoring systems automatically place orders
when certain reorder points are reached  It must be ensured that
the requisition made by the departments are clear, complete
and appropriately described  The buyer has to check the
accuracy of the content of the requisition 
After the requisition is received by the buyer, the purchase department
starts to look out in the market to identify potential sources of supply 
In the cases of routine products for which supplier
Procurement procedure and the documents serve to provide the
relationships are already established, the order is placed
with the listed suppliers  For new or high value items
investigation of the supplier is made  If the item is highly
technical or complex a cross functional team is formed to
qualify suppliers and make team decision about the most suited supplier 
After qualifying a group of potential suppliers,
the buyers may request for proposal or quotations
for competitive bidding and negotiation  A comparative statement is
prepared to assess all potential vendors across the required parameters 
Supplier selection and placement, once suppliers have been
framework for supply of materials and provide the means
selected, the purchase order with details is prepared 
This becomes a legal contract document with quality
specifications, product specifications, quantity, price,
delivery terms and payment terms, and it should be clearly
stated to avoid disputes later  Most companies include terms and
conditions which usually provide legal protection to the buyer
on acceptance and termination of the contract  Multiple copies of
purchase order are prepared for communication to internal
and external stakeholders of the order  In most cases orignal
copy of the purchase order is sent to the supplier 
for processing information from various departments to complete
No contract is complete until the order is accepted by the supplier 
An acknowledgement is sent to the buyer mentioning
their terms of supply  In case of conflict in terms, law omits
these terms leaving settlement of conflict to negotiation 
Hence, buyers need to review suppliers acceptance with great care 
The purchase department's responsibility does not
end with the order  It has to take the responsibility till
materials are delivered and accepted  Important orders with
critical delivery dates should receive regular follow up attention 
When a consignment is received, it is checked for
the job on hand  Let us look at the basic operating procedures
various details using purchase order and the shipment slip 
It is also inspected for quantity and general condition
and a receiving report is prepared  These days, much of the clerical
work is reduced using a computer- based system with bar-code identification 
Before some shipments are accepted,
a technical inspection may be necessary 
Copies of this inspection report are sent to the purchasing and accounting sessions 
Simultaneous review of the purchase order, the receiving
report and the invoice is done to determine the quantity and the
type of material ordered and received 
that integrates the activities into a complete purchasing cycle 
It should be done soon after receiving invoice
to enable from payments which go a long way
in maintaing good supplier relationship 
Once the invoice auditing is done and the payment is made, the order is closed 
Thank you learners and an exercise for you,

Mass customization takes to another level of
manufacturing mass production and custom made with lower
unit cost  Hence, different mass customer groups are targeted in
mass customization rather than a single client  Mass customization
is used in different business and allows user to
change their requirements  It is also known as made to order
or bill to order  Learning objectives: Understand the
concept of mass customization and supply chain management,
demonstrate the approaches and current trends in mass
customization and supply chain in specific business contexts,
Department of Business Administration  Avinashilingam
describe the strategies, challenges of mass
customization and supply chain management, explain the impact
of mass customization on supply chain management activities  Learning outcomes:
By the end of the session, the learners will be able, to analyze
the impact of mass customization on supply chain management,
apply the strategies of mass customization and supply chain
management on various business activities, develop strategies
for mass customization for different organization,
application of various approaches to mass customization in business 
Let us see what is mass customization?
institute for home science and higher education for women
Mass customization: It allows the customer to design a
particular feature for the product keeping the cost closer
to that of mass-produced products  In certain cases,
the components of the customized product are modular 
The flexibility that is available in mass customization
allows the customer to mix and match various options
to create semi custom final product 
Mass customization is applied in various fields such as retail
industries, software industries  For example, the software
creators may use mass customization to include
Coimbatore Tamil Nadu  Dear learners welcome you all to the
software based product configurations which helps their
end users to add or change the specific function of the core product 
Mass customization and its approaches  Mass customization
is done in four ways  They are collaborative customization,
adaptive customization, cosmetic customization, and transparent customization 
The first type of customization is collaborative customization 
Collaborative customization: Where the company
talks to the client and help them recognize what they need 
The company identify the factors that fulfills the needs of the
customers and change the product configuration according to the
module on mass customization and supply chain management 
client needs and create a customized product for the client 
This approach comes under mass customization
and it is highly customer centric  Collaborative customization
helps the client to identify exactly what they want, when the
customer gets confused between huge variety of options 
The customer need is designed as customized product through
collaborative customization  The second type of customization
is adaptive customization  Adaptive customization is one
where there is no change in the client representation and the
product configuration  Under adaptive customization
Mass customization means emphasizing changes to the product or
the business offer one standard product to the customers which can be
optimized to suit customer expectations under various situations 
The product is designed in such a way that it
can be customized by the end user  This type of approach is
more suitable for client- base business  Cosmetic customization:
In cosmetic customization, there is no change in the standard of
product, but there is change in representation of the product by the client 
Under cosmetic customization, the company
advertise a standard product to different group of customers 
Cosmetic customization works well when the customer uses the
services in order to suit a particular group of customers 
same product but the client position it's differently  Under
cosmetic customization the standard of the products is not
customized, but the products are packed differently to suit
different kinds of customers  In this approach,
the company advertise the features
and benefits of the product in different manner 
The promotional campaigns are designed differently and in
cosmetic customization, the product mostly carries the
client name  This approach offers a great value to maximum
number of clients  The next type of approach is the transparent
It is the process of delivering wide market goods and services
customization  In this approach the company offers various
changes in the product, but there is no change in
representation of the clients  Transparent customization
produces customized product for the individuals
without informing them that the products are exclusively made for them 
This approach is applicable for the businesses
only when the client-needs are predictable  The business that
deals with transparent customization analyse
the client's behavior without having a direct communication with them 
Then the company customize the product for their client 
after modify to satisfy a specific customer needs 
With this basic understanding of mass customization and it's
approaches a small exercise for you  Identify any two
organizations that adapt collaborative customization
and adaptive customization approach  Thank you and welcome you all
for the next two lessons in mass customization and supply chain management 
Mass customization is a combination of personalization and flexibility 
Dear learners! Hope you have enjoyed the lesson one on mass
Supply chain management is a continuous process or activity from
sourcing of raw materials or components that is needed to
create product or services and deliver to the end users 
Supply chain management is a network of business processes where all
the business activities are integrated with one another 
Supply chain management is a network of activities involving
from procurement of raw materials manufacturing, which
involves converting the raw materials into finished products
and distribution management, which involves selling the
finished goods to the customers  Supply chain management is
customization and its approaches 
called as an art of management of providing the right product
to the right customer at the right place at the right time at
the right cost to the customers  Next comes, the supply chain
management strategies for an organization  Supply chain
strategies are considered to be the backbone of today's business organization 
The major strategies for better supply
chain management in the current scenario are: The business
organization can adapt a demand driven planning and business
operating model based on the real time demand insights and
demand shaping  Adapting and agile supply chain with rapid

planning an integrated execution is followed by organizations 
The business organization can optimize the product designs
and product management for supply, manufacturing,
and sustainability to accelerate profitable innovation 
The company can align the supply chain with
business goals by integration sales and operations planning
with corporate business planning  The organization can
embed sustainability into supply chain operations which
help the organization in reducing carbon inefficiencies
with minimized energy consumption, less wastage with

optimize travel and transportation  The organization
can ensure reliability and predictable supply with help
of the business houses to avoid shortfalls  Working on continuous
improvement and operational excellence strategies is a
foundation for successful end- to-end supply chain operations 
Supply chain management strategy involves effective market
coverage, availability of products at all location
and ease of customer use  Whenever a product is introduced in the
market and advertise the product should be easily available for

the customers at all sales counter so that the customers
can easily buy the products  Suppose, if the product is not
available at the right time at the right place, it may drop the
interest of the customers in purchase decision 
The two critical elements or the inventory visibility in
operation in supply chain management and it may have the
direct impact on cost drivers and the bottom line on the
balance sheet  Inventory management value and it is an
asset for the company  Every business organization must have
a standard for inventory turnaround which is optimum for the business 
Let us see what is supply chain management? Supply chain
Inventory turn around means how many number of times
the inventory has been sold and replaced over a period of twelve months 
The strength of the inventory relates to the strength of the business 
In the global context the finished good inventory is
held at many locations such as distribution
centres and are managed by third parties  Apart from the
inventory with distributors and retail stocking points lot of
inventory would also be in the pipeline in transportation 
Suppose if there is any loss of inventory anywhere in the supply
chain it would result in the loss of value  Effective
management involves a wide range of activities such as planning,
control of inventory and visibility of inventory acts as
a major key factor of supply chain management function 
Current trend and technology of mass customization 
The automated manufacturing machinery are incorporated with
order taking to enable customization 
It is most important for mass customized product lines 
The company that is involved in numerous mass production combines the order
receipt and fulfillment with the internet- based client interface 
In real time with the help of internet the companies can
easily interact with their clients and create opportunities
controlling, and executing the product flow from the
for mass customization  Internet has improved the delivery system
with the customer interacting through various sources like
mobile apps, emails, promotions, or online progress tracking system 
Various companies such as: Individuals com, Newspages,
and Yahoo are utilizing the internet for creating customized
news items for their visitors  Most of the business
organization are using ease of online platform to enable the
client to design their products  The music based companies like

Conclusion: Mass customization is relatively new
phenomena gaining acceptance by many companies  As the
marketplace continues to evolve and technologies provide greater
abilities for the manufacturer, mass customization should
continue to grow  In recent years, mass customization has
gained the growing attention of different industries  One of the
major obstacles for the company's going for mass
customization is to design their mass customization manufacturing system 
Mass customization manufacturing system should
mainly focus on flexibility with customers and quick
The biggest challenge of mass customization is that
responsiveness to individual customer order  It is based on
balance between pure customization and mass production 
The success of customized product manufacturing
is dependent on the product and process development 
It also addresses the importance of leveraging basic choice
offerings and wide variety offerings  With this basic
understanding of challenges of mass customization
and customization strategy, a small exercise for you  Identify any
two organizations that adopt tailored customization strategies 
Thank you 
it is not appropriate for all market customers and products 
In most of the products the customers are not interested in
getting a customized product like light or bulb or washing
detergent etc  At the same time, the cost of the customized
product is also very high and the customer has to wait
for a longer time to get them 
The second challenge is adaptation for the basic product 
Mass customization is successful for the luxury product
such as designer wear and cars 
chain management and its strategies for an organization 
This concept works better for high end products,
whereas mass customization is
not economically feasible for most of the business which
produces the basic products  In most of the business profit
earned by the customization does not outweigh the complexity and
cost of producing the customized product  The next challenge is
replacement and reverse logistics  When a customer
returns a customized product, it may create a lot of problem for
the manufacturers  In most cases, the situation might not
arise as the product are designed according to the
Welcome you all to the third lesson on mass customization
configuration made by the customers  But if some return
takes place in such a case, the business should have the
mechanism to reverse the customized product, else it
might face many issues because the chance of getting another
customer wanting the same product as someone else are too narrow 
It may lead to the business to a tricky situation 
Majority of the companies do not have the written policy 
The next challenge is supply chain optimization  The major barrier
faced by the organization in mass customization is efficient
handling of supply chain  It is difficult for the business to
and supply chain management  The third lesson deals with
handle supply chain in an effective manner 
Since the system of suppliers are already optimized and designed for a
prearranged number of products rather, meeting an unforeseen demand 
Most of the companies have not integrate the latest <?>tthe</?>
supply chain management applications like JIT,
automated planning and it might result in problems of flexibility and visibility 
In the current scenario supply chain is based on push model whereas
mass customization is based on pull model 
It is very difficult for the business to manage 
The problem in supply chain can be solved only when the business
challenges of mass customization and customization strategies 
can balance between mass customization
and mass production to create standard product 
The product that is produced can be configured in a manner
that they can be customizable in the future 
For most of the business, it is not possible
and it is not economically feasible to start the customization
process at the start of supply chain  It indicates that the
business are able to implement mass customization partially 
This method is also advantageous for the manufacturers  Since the

manufacturer to meet the needs of different types of consumers market 
This method introduces a new target market for the
manufacturer and allow them to explore the possibility of
manufacturing products for them 
Next comes the customization strategies 
Lampel and Mintzberg during the year 1996
has proposed five customization strategies,
where the customer can define the product specification
at the operation stage  The five customization strategies are pure standardization
segmented standardization, customized standardization,
There are various challenges, the organization has to face during
tailored customization and pure customization  Four stages are
consider such as design, fabrication, assembly and distribution 
The shaded stage represents standardization
and the unshaded stage represents customization 
The first type is pure standardization  In pure standardization,
the product is not customized for the customers  The company
pushes the product as how it is manufactured 
In all the four stages the company maintains standardization 
The customer also buy them as offered by the company 
The next one is segmented standardization 
mass customization  They are challenges with high cost,
In segmented standardization, the customer does not have the
direct influence on the final product  The customer has to
choose between options the vendor decide to offer 
In segmented standardization there is higher degree of flexibility
the customers can influence on the distribution process 
The next type is customized standardization  The customer can
influence on the final product by choosing between standardized
components is called customized standardization  The production
remains standardized in design and fabrication process  Where as
the process is customized in the assemble and distribution
adaptation for basic products, replacement and reverse
process where the customer specifications are met 
The next is tailored customization  Tailored customization occurs
when the customer has the ability to alter the
specification of the product to some extent during fabrication stage 
In tailored customization  The standardization is
maintained in the design stage, and the product is customized
from fabrication stage to the distribution stage 
And the last is pure customization  Pure customization occurs only
when the customers can interfere on design stage itself 
The entire process is customized for the customers according to their requirements

Hi learners! Do you remember the story of the hare and the tortoise race?
Dear learners! This module on Agile Supply Chain
Management focuses on how the organizations can implement
agile supply chains as two lessons, namely agile
businesses and its strategic importance, agile supply chain management practices 
What do you understand by the word "Agile"? Is it flexibility to
move quickly and easily? Yes, you are right  Then what do you
think of agility in business? Does it mean organizations are
able to respond quickly to the changes in the business
environment? Yes, you are correct

What is interesting with Benetton Spa is that it is in an industry,
which is dynamic and driven by trends and fads, with customers
wanting something new always  What did Benetton Spa do to
achieve this success? It identified that the processes
are information intensive that the products have low
information content but the designs, production and
marketing processes are highly information intensive 
It was identified that 20% of the new fashion ideas depended on
previous fashion ideas  They leveraged this nature of the

design time and increase the response time  It identified ways
of using IT for quick response to changes and fashion trends 
Some of the process specifications are: The computer
integrated manufacturing systems provided overnight adjustments of production 
The worldwide licensees received the items
three times faster than the major competitors 
Production of garments was postponed until the order is placed, thereby
eliminating overstocking and reverse logistics 
Flexibility offered by computerized manufacturing systems allow
organizations move with lot of strength? But rest and delay
quick response and deleted slow moving items from the product
line but extended the production to fast moving items 
For example, based on the information received from each
store immediately after each sale, the company dye their
sweaters to match the demand  What did you understand from the
example of Benetton Spa? Is Benetton Spa in agile business?
And what are the various agile activities of Benton Spa?
Benetton Spa is an agile organization  It is quick in
thinking, doing and changing designs to meet the customer trends 
The customer database is digitally integrated with all

Now, let us move on to the first lesson on
lean supply chain management practices 
Music
What comes to your mind when you see someone lean? Don't you say
the person is cute with no extra fat, healthy and fast 
Yes  It is the same with lean practices by the organization 
differentiation are the two major strategic decisions of organizations 
The lean organization aims at cost leadership by elimination of
waste in all its operations

Lean management is a management practice that focuses on cost
leadership through continuous improvement and incremental
changes for elimination of waste  What are the areas where
lean organizations reduce waste? TIMWOOD is an acronym that
describes activities in manufacturing that can lead to
the waste and it represents transport, inventory, motion,
waiting, over processing, over production and defects 
This strategic choice of organization has
Don't you think all these activities are also a part of supply chain?
The activities described by TIMWOOD are all activities of
the supply chain too and lean supply chain management
practices are inbuilt into the organization that aim at
efficiency and cost leadership  Now, having understood the
importance of lean supply chain in waste elimination,

lean supply chain models are efficiency oriented supply chains 
Lean supply chain models are low cost supply chains that
focus on high utilization of assets, reduce the lead time and
grouped supply chain to be effective or responsive

The lean supply chain models are efficient
supply chain model, fast supply chain model and continuous flow
supply chain model  The lean supply chain models are
applicable when demand has become more certain and supply is predictable,
margins are lower and intense competition is present,
price influences customer choice  Lean supply

This is customer lifecycle 
customer lifecycle describes the stages
that a customer goes through when identifying a need,
This module has three lessons that deals with
considering purchasing, using and maintaining loyalty to the
product or services  The phases in customer lifecycle are
need identification, awareness, learning,
configuration, evaluation, acquisition, use, being loyal,
and to buy again and again 
What do organizations, marketers and retailers do
to hold the customer across the whole customer lifecycle?
In simple terms, they gain the
attention of the potential customers, influence the customer

Organizations move across the customer lifecycle
by developing trust in the minds of the customers
with three business processes namely
include and engage, which includes their efforts to get a
prospect's attention, create awareness and engage in a
dialogue to move the customer into the customer lifecycle 
Acquire, educate the prospects, maintain attention, create interest

What is a decoupling point in leagile supply chain and how
to position  The decoupling point in the supply chain can be well
understood by recalling the push and pull boundary in the supply
chain  The form set boundary as to which of the supply chain
processor should be push processes and which of them

and push processes said the push pull boundary interface between
the push base stages and the pull based stages is the push

the decoupling point is a point where the customer order arrives
and the organization's change its supply chain process from
lean to agile  The decoupling point is viewed as a boundary
between make the stock and make to order process across the

conscious, use green products and support the government and
corporate initiatives to go green  So, do you think supply
chain practices by corporate help you to be eco friendly?
Yes, but how? In today's lesson, the focus is on what drives
supply chains to be eco friendly? What are the green
supply chain
practices?
Green supply chains are supply chains wherein the upstream and
the downstream supply chain practitioners aim at minimizing
the environmental impact of both forward and reverse flow of
the other hand are moving towards green products  Go green,
materials, information and funds Green drivers are
motivators that induce business organizations to adapt to green
supply
chain practices 
The drivers that induce green supply chain practices are
customers, international markets, government regulations,
competitors, stake holders and industrial group 
The customers today have gone environmentally friendly and
are looking for green products like organic food products, less
plastic and bio-degradable products, less use of creating
green products, Green corporates are the buzzwords today 
natural and pollution inducing resources  Customers who support
eco friendly products and processes are important drivers
of green supply chain management practices 
Corporates today are with international markets either
because the products are exported or because
international brands or competitors for the domestic
brands  The global requirement for eco friendly products and
practices drives green supply chain practices  Some examples
are air and water quality standards and e-waste
management standards 
Corporates are positioning themselves as green corporates
Government regulations and laws enforced by the government on
environmental damages, renewable resources and dumping of
products have triggered organizations to follow green
supply chain practices 
Environmentally friendly practices by global competitors
and cost advantage due to less wastage and recycling of
resources have triggered green thinking in supply chain
practices 
Demand and inducement from the community, industrial
association, interest groups NGOs and management motivate
with green products  What has go green got to do with supply
corporates to follow sustainable practices 
Supply chain management practices are spread across
activities, inbound logistics operations, outbound logistics
marketing and after sales service  Some of the green
supply chain practices across these activities are, Green
inbound practices, profiling raw materials without
environmentally hazardous substances  Supplier
collaboration for environmentally friendly

ISO 140001 certification fosters the
culture of Go Green across the organisation by integrating
environmental issues with business operations for improved
efficiency and cost reduction and by continuous improvement of
environmental performance of an organisation 
Lean supply chain practices provide ways to cut costs and
improve operational efficiency from the customer perspective to
add value to the products and services, while green supply chain
management practices provide ways to eliminate waste from the
environment perspective and ensure sustainability  Now
questions  What is the relationship of green supply
having understood what is ISO 14,001? Let us look What can
be the relationship between these three components?
A research on casual relationship between lean supply chain
practices, green supply chain management practices and
organizational performance considered 200 manufacturing
firms and identified that there is a relationship between lean
adoption  ISO 14,001 and greens supply chain practices 
Some highlighting points of the research are- The assimilation of
lean practices by the organization can be captured by
the extent of lean adaptations and categorized as lean
chain management systems with ISO 14,001 and lean supply chain
indicators, lean movers and lean adopters  The research indicated
that ISO 14,001 has a significant influence on a lean
supply chain practices, lean supply chain practices and
organizational performance  In the presence of ISO 14,001
certification there was a difference in the lean
adaptation groups across the green supply chain practices in
the areas of green inbound logistics, green outbound
logistics and environmental performance 
So, what does this mean? It means that ISO 14,001 provides a
support system and culture that can be extended to lean supply
practices  Is there an impact of green supply chain management
chain management and green supply chain management
practices  When organizations scale up their lean adaptation,
they can parallely implement ISO 14,001 certification to foster
lean and green supply chain management practices 
I would like to sum up the lesson on integrating lean and
green supply chain with an empirical model  That was the
outcome of the research on crucial relationship between
lean supply chain practices, green supply chain management
practices and organizational performance construing 200
manufacturing firms  This structural equation model
practices, lean supply chain practices and organizational
indicated that the green drivers comprising of customers,
international markets, governments, stakeholders

also connects to the manufacturers centralized
inventory  So, wherever you get the products are sold out and
you will automatically the system will alert you when you
have to get the supplies from the customers, supplies from the
manufacturers  So, it will there are additional systems which
allow you to automatically place the orders to the manufacturers
so and so date and will automatically project you how
many inventories are you required during the season and
also it predicts the future also  So, the the current supply
chains for effective business operations in e commerce
Chain Management software's are you know capable of predicting
your inventory systems will in advance for example, if you're
in month of October, okay  So, it will automatically check what
are the products have sold during the Christmas season and
it will automatically alert you what are the things you have to
order it from the manufacturer and how many things how many
products are available in the manufacturers website  So it
will automatically alert you so when you have to order reorder
the things again, let me explain about advantages and
disadvantages of drop shipping methods  So the drop shipping
platform  May I have the pleasure of introducing Mr  S  Raja
method advantages are you don't want to maintain any inventory
so you won't have any debt stocks in your you know system, as
well as because the lost of lot of retailers fail because of the
debt stocks  Even if you have, if you're selling ten products,
seven products might go well and three products may not go well 
So, these three products stocks would take the seven products
profit  So this is the major disadvantage is the retail
system  So, this drop shipping method  So the the seller does not
want to maintain any inventory on his own  So, because he is
connected with the manufacturers so he is directly getting the
Rajan, a person with great conviction and commitment to
products from the manufacturer and he's directly shipping to
the customers so he don't want to maintain any thing on his
own 
The second thing is the disadvantage what I see from
this dropshipping model is when the manufacturer running out of
stock, he does not have an intimate that we are running out
of stock  So, but still he he sells he, he advertise his
products on his platforms, let's say Amazon or wherever and the
people are buying it and whenever when he tried to place
the order to the manufacturer and the manufacturer says I
sustain a business venture during the period of disruption
don't have any products in stock  So, this would give you
the more you know, customer dissatisfaction rate and a lot
of other issues because the sales rank might go down 
Technically speaking, if you're not selling any products more
than three days or if your inventory is zero for more than
three days your sales rank will go down  So, the customers will
not be coming to your you know, site for anymore  So, the bond
rate and a lot of technical stuffs are there  So, this is
the main disadvantage for you know, the drop shipping model
the other disadvantages, for example, if the if the
in digital platform  Raja Rajan is the CFO of Boston Creative
manufacturer discontinue the product, or he is selling the
different sizes or different colors, and if he's not updated
with his current system, then again, it's a problem  So, these
are the disadvantages and advantages in the dropshipping
model  But lot of you know the new ecommerce sellers are
preferring this drop shipping model because they don't want to
maintain any stocks so they don't want to invest any money on top
of everything so  So, this is the, you know, best thing is
this is a current method currently going on the e
commerce platforms and the regular conventional model is

it's like are ordering something you are ordering
hundred units from the manufacturer and you are
keeping it with you and you are, you are advertising the product
to the multiple marketplaces, let's say Amazon, EBay and your
own websites  So, you ship the products whenever you
get an order from these websites, and when you sending
the products to the customers  The disadvantages of the
conventional model might be what it happens is, for example,
you're selling in platform ABC, and platform A suddenly picks it
up and it's in Amazon, you're selling 50 units a day, okay? So
Limited  He has completed his B  tech  He started his career as a
you don't, you don't have any idea how much I have to stock it
again  For example, if my entire As inventory goes within a two
days, I have to order it again from the manufacturer and the
manufacturer might say, I need at least five to six days to
supply you  So and if you take another six days to give it back
and you have to give it to the customers again the same you
know, the, the customer satisfaction might go here and
there and the second time ordering, he's ordering let's
say, Okay, I ran out of stock within two days  So, let me
order thousands units and I will keep it in stock  And worst case
software engineer and as traveled to the United States to
scenario, the sales is not picking up or you know, so the
season might be over by the time  So, in that case, he have
thousands stocks, but he is not able to sell thousands units in a
month  So he might have a debt stocks around 800 900 units and
you know, so they they dosen't assume that is a one product if
he has a 500 600 products  So, this model, you know, so that's
what the most of the people are preferring the drop shipping
method rather than the conventional supplying you know
conventional stock keeping methods 
Dear students, you have got greater inputs from Mr  Raja Rajan who had
work with IT majors like Cognizant and Infosys  As a
spoken about the different types of supply chains like
dropshipping, regular channels as like any other business  Thank
you students  Let's meet again

run journey of learning this model, we are bringing a
finance and behavioral finance  We have Dr  P Chitramani
Professor, Department of Business Administration and the
MOOC co-ordinate as well as we have Dr  Vijaya, joining this
interview panel  Let me take you to the interview now  Ma'am,
over to you 
You have a wide range of experience in marketing your
products in Amazon and other e commerce sites  Can you provide
insights on supply chain management in e commerce?
Thanks Arthi Mam, Thanks Jerinabi, sure! Actually the current e commerce
world there are different types of supply chain management is
scintillating interview with a successful business personality 
happening right now  So one is drop shipping and the second one
is a conventional model that is manufacturer to retailer or
manufacturer to retailer to distributor to retailer  The
current trending one is called as a drop shipping  It's very
good because they don't maintain any inventory system in their
place for example  So, I am selling pro, I am
manufacturing a product called A and you are selling on e
commerce platform and you don't maintain any stocks, what you do
is you just display in the e commerce platforms say that I
sell these many products into website A, and whenever you get
More than theoretical expression to gain subject knowledge 
the orders, you directly send the orders to me, I will supply the
products to the customers  So, in this model, this drop shipping
model that is no inventory management for the people who's
managing the website  So, the other disadvantages of the drop
shipping model is, if I'm running out of stock, the manufacturer
running out of stock and you display the product is available
and the customer is ordering the product and you will be ending
up you know, placing the order to me because I don't have a
store the manufacturer doesn't have a stock and you already
received the order and the customer,
Practical exposure is much more important to add to our
dissatisfaction would be height  So, the conve the the other method is like
distributor was the retailers  This conventional model is still
goes good  Again we have the same, you know issues something
like the inventory management between the manufacturers versus
the retailer, but it has an advantage they have they will be
connected together and they will be keep getting the updates from
the manufacturer to retailers every days or their systems will
be synced  So, these are the two types everybody are using for
the supply chain management purpose the solution for this
dropshipping model and the conventional model there are a
knowledge repository  This interview will be loaded with
lot of tools that are available currently in the market that is
called as oberlo and these kind of systems which would help you
to sync the manufacturers inventory versus the retailer's
inventory or whoever is doing the drop shipping model  They
are can they are you know, managing the inventory system as
a centralized  So, if you own an e commerce platform and you are
selling into three marketplaces, let's say you're selling in
Amazon as well as you're selling on ebay and you're selling on
your own websites so whenever an instance if the customer is
there are a lot of customers who's buying the products from
information related to different types of supply chains
you, you are a drop shipper and you are getting the orders are
getting from these three websites, it might be really your
product A might go well in Amazon and product B might go
well in Ebay and product C might go well in your website  So,
these, the person cannot manage all the inventories and
they cannot monitor the systems every day  So, what they do is
they connect with a centralized system it's called us there are
a lot of third party software's are available it's one of the
best thing is called as an oberlo  So what they do was
they connect all your platforms variable you're selling it so
in e commerce business  And the challenges of managing supply
Hi students, welcome back to interview  On to the interview
and there are a lot of supply chain management solutions out
there but we personally use zohos and oberlo  So, the Zoho,
what it will do is you It will maintain the entire inventory
management system and it will alert you when, when the trend is
going up and when the trend is going low, when you have to you
know, keep stocking your inventories and when you have to
keep up your packaging materials and there you have to maintain
entire stocks in that system  So, the other side the order
management system is also plays a vital role for the supply
chain management, as I said earlier, and you sell it in the
sell the products  For example, if you are planning to sell some
multiple platforms and we sell it like almost 810 countries,
and we have the stocks in almost 10 countries you know, so that's
very hectic task, because we never know which product will
sell in which countries so and based on the seasons  For
example, the back to school season, let's say that starts
from in the US  It's between July to August And we cannot
blindly stock up all the products because it will just go
between June to July time period you know  So, after that nobody is
going to buy the product  So we have to plan a call From the
month of April, and we have to stock it up and when we cleared
product you know, so we have to buy the products from the
it out, it's done  So, we have to plan next year and we have to
take out all the inventories which is already in the
fulfillment centers, and we have to take back all the stocks and
we have to keep it in our in house  If we maintain the stocks
in the fulfillment centers, we have to pay a lot of money for
maintaining our stocks in the system or in their fulfillment
centers, we have to pay a lot of money  So, to avoid this, we are
using centralized software's and also the good there are a lot of
software's as I told so for the USA and UK we are using the
GoDaddy systems, which would absolutely maintain all your
manufacturer and we have to take the product photoshoot and we
inventories and order management's if you are selling
in three platform we are almost selling like Amazon, eBay,
Walmart and CEOs and our own platform  There are six eight
season six, seven platforms only for the US alone  So, seven
marketplaces on one inventory system, it's very difficult to
maintain it as well as the supply chain from here  We are
We are supplying the products from various countries, we are
manufacturing the product from India as well as we are, we are
getting some couple of raw materials from China as well 
So, we have to supply those products to those countries on
have to publish into each and every website where we are
the current dates and you know, on the the current quality,
there are in
this kind of things, we are getting some kind of quality
issues as well  As I said, we know if if the manufacturer is
running out of the problem product, and we have to check
about the alternate products, what could be, you know,
balanced between that early product and this one  So, we
personally believe systems rather than, you know,
maintaining the physical inventories, we do physical
inventories but it's, it's, it's not quite possible if you have a
selling it  So in this scenario, the when the supply chain
large number of fulfillment centers and selling it in a
multiple platforms, if you're just selling in one ecommerce
sites, and if you just have one fulfillment center, then it's
fine so you can manage it on its own but if you're going for a
bigger You have to go for software's that was I recommend
personally,
the students who have got greater inputs from Mr  Raja
Rajan, who had spoken about the different types of supply chains
like dropshipping, regular channels as like any other
business  He mentioned about the chain of operations between
management breaks, you know, so these are the challenges we use
manufacturer retailer, manufacturer to distributor,
distributor to retailer, and also about the challenges like
quality issues on time supply of raw materials, business-
environmental changes, improper inventory management, etc  In in
e commerce business  We discuss about the role of supply chains
in effective e commerce business operations  Thank you students 
Let's meet again 
to really face it  For example, we are getting some glitter
papers from China  So when we get the glitter papers on the
first time and we get it like a pure gold color, and we we
create the product and we take the photoshoot of the product
now 
and we display it enough all our websites and we had we bought
at like 1000 sheets something like that  So we bought it and
we almost sold all the products on the, on the particular
timeframe  And when we get so when we are when we are about to
get out of stock and when we plan to place an order second
time the manufacturer says we stopped selling the gold plated
papers  So, we are stuck there you know so, because we have
spent a lot of money on taking the product photo shoot and
uploading in the ecommerce websites as well as we take a
lot of ads and we spend on on a lot of advertisements and load
Thank you Raja Rajan  It was very interesting when you discussed
and a lot of things  So, when the manufacturer stops the
supplies and we you know these money are rolled out  So, so we
have to find the products  So then we are conscious whenever
we get the products with the error free supply chain issues 
So when we select those kind of products accordingly and we are
you know, we are selling those products in the e commerce
platforms  So this is the main challenge we usually face and
there are a lot of additional problems also there for example
from January to October, okay, so the when I say the peak season
would be for the USA and we are selling in the USA and UK
about the models and now each commerce
customers, our peak season would be on a Christmas season  That's
like starts from November to December timeframe  In the
timeframes for the resellers I'm talking about  So for example,
so if you are selling the Christmas decorations, right, so
when we are selling the Christmas decorations, we should
place an order on or before June July, because when we just come
to October and when we place the Christmas decoration products to
the supplier, and they say sorry, everybody are asking
decorations on the same date, we have a limited resources here 
And we don't have a capability of manufacturing the products in
business but in general
higher numbers  So, that time we struck, so we have to plan the
inventory system very properly, and we have to place an order on
or before the Christmas season starts  And there are a lot of
other issues also there let's say an Amazon fulfillment  So,
for example, even if we have a stocks and be sent to the
fulfillment centers, and what they say is we have we have a
lot of products are coming in our inventory system? So, we have
certain delays  So that's a big challenge you know  So when we
are selling good like say 100 200 units a day when
fulfillment center saying that we cannot take the inventory
irrespective of whether you use a drop shipment model or a
furthermore, and we are struck whatever the in whatever the
money we have invested for the stocks, it's dead  So; after
Christmas, nobody's going to buy the Christmas decorations, right 
So this is a you know, major challenges on the supply chain
management 
Thank you Raja Rajan for sharing your experiences on ecommerce
supply chain models and challenges  Can you say the
Supply Chain Solutions in e commerce business? Yes, of
course 
So, as we evolve more if you're, if you have a limited number of
traditional model, what are the challenges that you have faced
products, you don't want to go for software's, but you don't so
when we sell 500 or 600 products, different type of
products we have, definitely we have to go for software
solutions  There are a lot of solutions  There are solutions 
There are a lot of solutions available in the market, but we
personally go for high solutions like Zoho, or oberlo kind of
recognized software's  So, we personally use Zoho inventory 
The reason we ,we go for Zoho is it's, it's straightforward and
it's pretty simple and neat  So, since we are a manufacturer, and
we sell a couple of reselling, we do a couple of reselling
in a supply chain when it comes to e commerce or E business 
products  As a manufacturer, we have we are producing more than
400 to 500 products worldwide  And we have a lot of more than
800 to 900 raw materials, we have to keep it in stock,
including packaging materials, including you know, raw
materials, no, the supplies like a printings and a lot of
supplies, CNC needles, kind of etc etc  When we tell
about supply chain management, we are you know, we I have to
tell about two things  One is order management as well as the
inventory management that is supply chain management  So when
I say the supply chain management, we have to make
Sure ma'am Of course  So,
sense we are the manufacturer, we have to maintain more than
1200 raw materials, which includes from small products
from thread to needles and packing supplies and inks,
printer rings, needles and laser supplies and kind of learn a lot
of products  So, if we miss some products, okay, let's say we
created the product and we have to suppose to send the inventory
to the fulfillment center today, and we are running out of
packaging materials  And we are stuck on the day  You know, for
the simple things we, we lose hundreds of dollars every day 
So for this kind of things, we go for our solutions like Zoho
as a ecommerce seller, we have to do certain steps before we
Hi students, welcome back to interview  	In the previous
do is we will split it into 300, 300 to 300 to each suppliers
and we will get it done and from my point of view as a
manufacturer, what I do is I will select the product very
particularly whatever it shouldn't be any rare products
let's say if we do a lot of wooden products as well so and I
would personally see that, that wooden supplies are error free 
So that means we shouldn't be running out of stock  It may not
be seasonal product let's say some wooden products or some you
know some woods are seasonal so it will we will get it on that
particular season alone  So I will not select those products
website, when you sell a product in an e commerce website as a
even though if it sells good, I would not select the products, it
should be round the clock that should be available between 365
days and I will select the packaging things and everything
should be in a 365 day man and that means that means that I
shouldn't run out of raw materials at any time  You know
and for as I said I as the personally take care of the
multi vendor system and the raw materials and the packaging
supplies and everything is like hassle free then you can it
We'll be like, you know, running the clock  So otherwise, when
you go for larger inventories, you might face a problem on the
consumer, many times we send back the goods because we are
scenarios 
Thankyou Raja Rajan, I think it's quite interesting to note the
reverse logistics management of your practice  So it's again, we
are
putting all the burden only on the consumer 
Okay  One thing I would like to know, when the
consumer returned the products due to
the satisfaction or any reason Are you refunding the money or
keeping the money and their credits  Again, if you are not
refunding the money, you are keeping that money and the
not happy or even sometimes it is a false representation  I
credit again, the interest for those days
again, the refunds are a very interesting part  Because as you
said, Yes  As you know, business person we have to consider how
many days we hold the money and everything because every day the
money counts for managing the refunds actually as per our
company policies, we have a 30 days of return policies  So in
us but in India the scenarios are totally different but in
when they talk to USA and UK clients, so the refunds we have
the policies for any reasons we even we print it on our
packaging says that for any reasons if you're not satisfied
will say I get paid the price for the product when the good
or the quality is not up to your mark or anything, you know, so
we will just refund the money without no questions asked Let
me tell you an interesting scenario on the refund  Okay  We
have, there are I will not say all the customers I would say
just 1% or less than 1% of there are fake customers also  Let's
say let's take in scenario  We manufacture a lot of party
supply products and we sell it through a lot of countries and
we we usually get this kind of scenario for example, they order
a birthday party supplies  Okay, we will send them , Happy
Birthday banners or Garland's or whatever, right? So what the
reaches home, but I do not have money that day and the products
customer usually not usually, but no one of other  So what
they do is, they celebrate the birthday party without supplies 
And the next day after the party they say, you know, the quality
is not up to the mark or we are not celebrating the party due to
some reasons  And the package has arrived very late after my
birthday  So, so and so reasons right  So we usually you know,
so but it's considered as a less than one percentage  So, we
usually refund the money for them  And there are so when we
have a problem in those scenarios, the custom made
products, let's say if I want to print your name on the pin or
are going back or I'm not at home the products are going back
any custom products, you know, so if if we make a pin
personalized pin for you and we are shipping to you, and the
customer says that, no, my boss went and we bought a different
gift and you have to take the product back  So, what we will do to
the product which already have a name on it, right, you have to
consider that point also  So, yes, but as per our company
policies, we take it that as a negative account, as a loss
account and we take that amount into our consideration  So, but
there are a lot of other companies and you know, they
they personally do not take any custom orders or they do not
and suppose the product is not good again  So there's a lot of
take refunds on the custom orders and there are a lot of
written policies involved 
Yeah, this is all about the returns and refunds 
Dear students, as you all have experienced hearing Mr  Raja
Rajan, it is now imperative to recap his contributions  He has
given impetus on managing sales trend, customer satisfaction
through quick rich, seasonal impact, multi vendor system,
issues that fulfillment center challenges of reverse logistics,
gaining competitive knowledge through effective usage of
supply chains and finally achieving customer delight 
reverse logistics issues  There's so do you face such
May I take this opportunity to thank Mr  Raja Rajan for sparing his time  And
all academicians who have join this panel  Thank you all very much 
Thank you dear students, thank you so much  Thank you for, so
much
for this opportunity and answering your, all your
questions 
Thanks again 
issues in your supply chain on 
So yes, of course  Actually  Let me take your real time scenario
interview with Mr  Raja Rajan, we focused on two aspects of
what we are doing it, okay  So, to be frank, we start
selling our products in India  And the written ratio let's take
in written ratio  We almost get 30% of the problem  products
have been returned when we sell the same products what we sell
in USA when we start selling in India we almost get
30% of the products have been reached, no refund did that
means the customer is not satisfied with the product and
we have a lot of logistics issues say let's, let's say when
customers have said that my friend birthday was on tomorrow,
but your product has been delivered day after that, you
different types of supply chain and the various challenges
know  So, in those cases, we have to take it back and you
know, there are people sitting in Noida and they are expecting
the product to be delivered on the same day  It may not be
possible, you know, so there are a lot of understanding issues as
well, as well as their logistic issues and probably no it may
not meet their expectations as well  In these cases so we have
stopped selling the products in India and for the US sides  Yes,
we do have a lot of these challenges and stuff but what I
say is it's ultimately be like one person I would say, if we
sell hundred products that would be one product has been
related to supply chain management in e commerce
returned  And what we consider and most of you know, the brand
owners or the manufacturers, let's say they usually markup
that price, the written products, price in the product for
example, if I'm selling thousand products and there are 10
products have been returned the what is the cost of the return
product, let's say it's a, it's $100  Okay, so we add this
hundred dollars in thousand products, let's say we add 10
cents in each of the products that's all the brand does  So,
even I when I work with a lot of my clients, it's like nike,
vicoria secrets and everybody so they do the same  So we add what
business  Now we will elicit more information about the
is the orders the total returns and we add the price, we add the
market prices with the retail price  So when we, we expect that
it's it's you know, we cannot satisfy all the customers even
Apple has a lot of return customers and a lot of
dissatisfied customers  So, we accept that as a part of e
commerce platforms  So, but most of the thing we personally make
sure, we try to avoid the returns as much as possible  But yes,
there might be a one to five percentage we take it as
returns 
Can you share one or two scenarios way Supply Chain
importance of supply chains in the successful functioning of
Solutions help you to effectively carry out business?
To answer your question, you know, let me explain the live
scenarios what we are doing in our companies, you know  The
systems we have to fit the human errors, I would say the human
errors, there are scenarios who comes as a freshers and you
know, they really don't have any idea about let's say Father's
Day, okay, so if fathers we produce a lot of products for
the Father's Day and when we are trying to sell it on that
season, and the person who come as a fresher okay, so they
feed the system, how many units we are selling on that
the business in e commerce platform  On to the interview now 
particular month  For example in the Father's Day falls on June
okay  So, if the person is joining on March or April and
see there is a big peak on some products and what he usually
does he we face the same scenario okay  So what he have
identified as so these products are selling more and he expect
the same amount of products would sell on the respective
months  So, he has alerted the suppliers and saying that so we
need this much of products for the next couple of months, you
know, then, so we don't have any idea because we have a lot of
products and stocks and you know, so we never know what the
Thank you Raja Rajan  Maybe you have been talking about
humans are doing because we cannot monitor each and
everybody  So, the persons are already alerted the system  So
he placed in n number of products during rest of the
pharmacies time you know, so we got a lot of units and we have
to keep it in stock and we have to sell it in that kind of
system  So other things, I would say the multimeter system, so
Multi Window System like for example, if we are i, this is my
personal opinion so I usually don't depend on a single vendor 
So, for example if you are getting this pro if you're
getting a product from the supplier again, I usually try to
the
get supplier B and supplier C and we usually Place Order in a
circular basis  So, when, when the january month, we place an order
to a and February to b and we'll match to C  So in this scenario
and we will be touched with all the people and whenever we
supply a runs out of stock and we will get it from the B and
when the beans are not stock and we'll get from C and we'll get
it from both of them  So, for the Christmas seasons and you know
holiday peak seasons we usually get so if you order 1000 units
to supply a and he would say the everybody is asking thousand
units and I cannot produce that much of quantity  And what we'll
software for your internal supply chain  But in e commerce
Dear learners, welcome you all to the module on information
application software, robotics, Business Intelligence, Data
Analytics sensors and similar technologies allow seamless
coordination of information internally for enhancing
efficiency of the supply chain  Now finally, IT applications for
external supply  Information technologies enable
uninterrupted and seamless connectivity with the suppliers
spread across geographical locations  Technologies such as
electronic data interchange, enterprise resource planning,
Hypertext Markup Language, Extensible Markup Language,
vendor managed inventory, and web enabled portals enableS real
supply chain, comprehend the application of it in supply
time information sharing with the suppliers, which improves
transparency and reduce cost of transactions  Now having seen the
significance of information in various demand and supply  So,
let us now move on to the benefits of it in supply chain
management  Supply chain management in spite of its
complexity and shows competitive advantage to the organization 
Information Technology, when used appropriately can minimize
the complexities in the supply chain processes and operations
and contribute to quantifiable benefits to the organization 
Below listed are the top benefits for an organization due
chain processes and operations and understand the components
to IT applications in its supply chain activities  They are
reduced operating costs through efficient management of
resources, improved efficiency with real time communication and
joint decision making reduced shortages and delays in supply
chain processes through integration and collaboration,
increased supply chain profitability in specific and
business profitability in general  Enhanced supply chain network
through collaborations with all states to conclude
Information Technology in supply chain management would bring in
radical transformation and changes for excellence of any
and its applications of digital supply chain  In the first
organization  Results of it implementation in supply chain
management cannot be seen overnight  Further, the outcomes
might vary based on the way it is implemented  Therefore, right
use of information technology in supply chain management Combined
with clear vision and implementation will enable the
organizations to be futuristic and sustainable  Dear learners,
in the next module, we will discuss about the concept of
digital supply chains, along with its benefits, components
and challenges 
Thank you  Happy learning 
video, we will focus on IT and it's role in supply chain
management  Now moving to the introduction part every business
however large or small comprises a supply chain network  Supply
Chain includes a complex network of suppliers, manufacturers,
distributors, retailers, logistics and warehouse
providers and customers  Supply chain is responsible for smooth
flow of products, money and information within and amongst
technology in supply chain  I will be presenting this module
various supply chain partners  Here comes the role of
information technology, which has drastically changed the way
in which businesses are carried out  Supply Chain being an
interconnected structure, by its very nature is highly dependent
on IT for sharing and processing of information
across various stages 
IT has been utilized in various functions of supply chain in the
past three decades in various activities  IT ensures supply
chains to be agile and efficient by ensuring transparency,
automation and faster communication with greater
in three video lessons  The learning objectives of this
accuracy and lesser defects  Coordination of various
activities across various stages is possible only through it 
Supply Chain functions have been greatly impacted by IT and its
advances due to the following reasons  Number one, customer
satisfaction has become a topmost priority of all
businesses and increasing competitive pressures 
Information has become a crucial factor in reducing manpower at
inventory level  Also information plays a vital role
in strategic planning and in deployment of resources in the
organization  Now, moving on to objectives of IT in supply chain
module are to understand the role played by IT in supply
management, The following are the objectives for implementing
it in supply chain management as given by Sentry levy at all, in
2003  They are providing information availability and
visibility ,enabling a single point of contact of data,
allowing decisions based on total supply chain information and
enabling collaboration but supply chain path  Now, let us
discuss the functional role played by IT in supply chain
management  It can be broadly classified in three categories 
The first one being transaction execution  Firstly, IT supports
all transaction execution related activities  So that they
chain, discuss various technologies used in demand and
are perform smoothly and with greater accuracy  Transaction
execution includes IT applications to improve the
efficiency of all respective data add to enhance information
sharing amongst the supply chain states  Examples for transaction
processing include order processing, failing generating
codes, dispatch related details and delivery verification  The
second one does planning, collaboration and coordination 
IT is used in SCM, planning, coordination and collaborative
activities  This includes sharing of information related
to demand, inventory, production capacity with the channel
supply integration and to introduce the concept of digital
partners so that joint mission making is possible  Order and
shipment tracking is possible through coordination among
partners, enterprise resource planning, collaborative
planning, forecasting and replenishment, and vendor
managed inventory  These are few technologies that provide scope
for collaborative planning among channel path  The last one
is patient  IT is used for decisison making in supply chain 
Real time data capturing and sharing has enabled greater
visibility, agility, and real time decision making using
artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analysis and
supply chain along with its
predictive analytics tools  Such as real time sharing of
information helps in reducing delays to a greater extent and
it improves accuracy also, let us now discuss the role played
by IT in demand and supply side activities of supply chain  IT
supports and enhances the demand and supply side activities in a
supply chain  Coordination becomes much simpler, effective
and reliable with the use of IT in demand supply configuration 
Let us discuss briefly the various technologies involved in
such integration  Now, moving on to the IT for external demand 
This includes technologies involved in capturing the demand
components 
data from the end customer  This includes technologies such as
POS data, that is point of sales data RFID barcoding online
customer search data and alike  If customer demand data is
rightly captured and the same is shared, without any
distortion like bullwhip effect, then the manufacturer would be
able to match the supplies efficiently  The next one is it
for internal demand, the customer demand data collected
through various sources stays with the marketing department of
any organization  Appropriate technologies are needed to
integrate the entire demand data and organize the same according
Moving on to learning outcomes  At the end of the session,
to various criteria such as priorities for product types,
shelf life, customer preferences and alike  These technologies
would be helpful for planning and forecasting demand with
greater accuracy  IT for internal supply  The amount of
information being very huge nowadays ,there arises the need
for coordination of information within the company's internal
departments  Information Technologies play a vital role
in coordinating information across sourcing, production,
inventory, distribution, sales, logistics, and finance
functions  Technologies such as Internet, emails,sms, various

Supply Chain analytics  Supply chain analytics improves
operational efficiency of supply chains through data driven
decisions at strategic, operational and tactical levels 
Examples include identification of most efficient shipping
carrier, determination of right safety stock levels, customized
demand forecasting and inventory planning, controlling critical
process parameters and much more  Supply chain optimization
becomes easier with the application of supply chain
analytics  Now, having seen the benefits and elements of digital
4 0  Supply chains need to move towards a connected ,smart and
supply chain let us also look into some of the challenges
faced in transforming towards digital supply chain, lack of
preparation and understanding  That is, organizations still
have not developed digital maturity  They're able to
understand various technologies and its applications 
Organizations need to have a clear vision and mission towards
supply chain transformation in order to be successful  The next
challenge would be lack of resources, Organizations lack
resources in terms of technology, infrastructure,
manpower, materials, and funds for implementing digital supply
highly efficient systems for gaining competitive advantage
chain in total
Lack of collaborative culture 
Organizations have remained isolated till date without much
collaboration with channel partners  Today's customers are
highly demanding and seek transparency and visibility of
the supply chains  Collaborative culture among channel partners
enables value addition and enhances profitability of the
entire supply chain  The final challenge would be lack of
knowledge on risk management  Digital supply chains are prone
to cyber attacks and organizations lack awareness on
over others  What exactly is a digital supply chain? The term
data protection and privacy  Therefore, it becomes imperative
for organizations to understand the types of cyber risk and
ways and means to protect private data  To conclude, digital supply
chains enable organizations to lead forward with data driven
decisions and usage of right technologies in all supply chain
processes  It enables seamless connectivity with all its
channel partners on a real time basis, thereby providing high
levels of transparency in the supply chain  Digital technology
enablers such as AI, Internet of Things, sensors, robotics,
drones, nanotechnology, 3d printing, cloud services, and
digital supply chain may refer to management of digital aspects
geo locations have made supply chains more agile, responsive
and futuristic 
Disruptive technologies
often bring in new challenges and risk to the business such as
cyber attacks and theft of data 
Hence,
Businesses have to simultaneously monitor and
develop risk mitigation strategies 
while going digital
organizations need to develop well defined digital supply
of a physical supply chain, or management of delivery of
chain strategies and invest on right technologies to remind
competitive and sustain in the fast paced digital era  Dear
learners ,in the next video, we will discuss your real time case
to understand the role of IT in enhancing supply chain
operations  Thank you  Happy learning 
digital products supply chain  In this lesson, we'll be
discussing the concept of digital supply chain referring
to managing the digital aspects of supply chain  According to
Tony Hines 2001, Digital supply chains are configured to
distribute goods or services that have previously been
we had discussed about the significance of it in supply
supplied in physical form  Typical examples include books, music,
and films  However, Hines included business to business services,
like fashion design and product development that were made
digitally  Such digitization, removes time, distance and cost,
thereby enhancing value to the supply chain  Therefore, digital
supply chains looks at ways and means of improving efficiency
and profitability of the supply chain  According to a McKinsey
report on next generation digital supply chains, the
supply chain leaders ought to place sensors and everything 
Create networks everywhere  automate anything and analyze
chain in the previous video  In this video, we will discuss
everything to significantly improve performance and customer
satisfaction  What constitutes a digital supply chain management?
Digital supply chain management can be seen as the usual supply
chain management guided and managed by advanced digital
technologies such as internet of Things, blockchain, machine
learning, artificial intelligence, predictive
analytics, robotics and alike  The goal of digital supply chain
is to build a supply chain network which is resilient and
responsible  Now, moving on to advantages of digital supply
chain over traditional supply chain 
about digital supply chain, its advantages, key elements and
Increased transparency
technologies such as smart sensors RFID, blockchain, AARP
and alike ensures highest levels of transparency along the supply
chain, which enables the organization to monitor the
activities of upstream and downstream channel partners  The
next one is improved and real time communications, real time
data and information sharing is possible with POS data, AI,
IoT cloud based solutions, automation of warehouses,
logistics and inventory functions  Such real time
information enhances accurate planning, forecasting and
challenges of digital supply chain  Now, moving on to
reportng  The next one has improved collaboration among
channel partners  Technologies such as EDI, ERP, customer
relationship management, collaborative planning,
forecasting and replenishment and alike are used for
collaborative sourcing, joint innovation, demand planning, and
fulfillment, and many more  The next advantages allows space for
high levels of flexibility  Digital supply chains are highly
adaptable and agile  Digital supply chains provide efficient
management of changing market demands, differing supplier lead
times and many such uncertainties and lastly, highly
interaction ,digital supply chain is emerging as a new business
responsive  Real time information sharing of data using various
technologies such as Internet, email, sensors, etc enable
supply chains to be highly responsible thereby enabling
customer satisfaction  The next one is
elements of digital supply chain 
Following are the key elements of digital supply chain 
Integrated planning of supply and demand  Integrated materials
requirement planning, real time production planning, logistics
visibility and tracking allows for integrated supply side
planning  Similarly, real time customer driven demand, real
concept today with advancements and innovations in information
time inventory management, digital supply chain segmentation and other
technologies allows for integrated demand side planning
and execution  The next element is order management  Digital
supply chains enable automation of order management related
activities such as catalog management, order entry, order
fulfillment using AI and data analytics  This would enhance
customer experience increased profits and customer loyalty
logistics management  Timely sharing of supply related
shipment information real time tracking of vehicles social
media for sharing of weather information simulation runs GPS

Dear learners in continuation of the previous lesson,
supply chain  Organizations link the customer and the supply
chain operations to provide differentiating products,
services and delivery processes for different segments of customers 
Demand chain management integrates all the
activities across the demand chain, starting from the
delivery and the service to the end customer through the coordination of
raw material suppliers  Demand chain management involves four
phases namely demand and supply process integration, digital
integration, configuring the value system and cross
functional working relationships  With this brief
in this session we will continue to understand what is demand
explanation on demand chain management, let us move on to
understand the integration of demand and supply processes 
Rainbird suggests the process fusion model for demand and
supply process integration  And this model helps to understand
the relationship between demand and supply processes
across the customer life cycle  The three layers of the model stress,
first, the integration of customer into the value chain process 
Second, the conceptualization of dynamic thing,
customer relationships and third links the activities in
the demand processes with those in the supply process 
management and how to integrate demand management functions,
The integration of demand processes and supply chain processes is
explained as follows: The marketing managers on monitoring
the supply networks gain information from the market analysis 
This helps organizations to understand
the new products and services in the market  The expectations of the
customers in terms of products services and delivery 
The supply network provides inputs on customer behavior,
retail preferences and technology preferences  This inputs help
demand managers in segmenting and targeting the right customer segments 
At the evaluation stage, the consumers compare
supply chain processes and customer lifecycle  Demand chain
various products and services across various features and
functions of the product or brand  For example, if the
product is car, they compare the brands of cars based on mileage
grip, engine type and power, space and services  Capturing data
at the evaluation phase from the customers will help the
marketers to carry out the following demand and supply processes:
Forecasting the demand, segmenting the market based on
needs, preferences and profitability, designing supply
networks, proposing delivery and service packages 
In the third phase of customer lifecycle the decision to purchase is taken 
management, integrating, marketing and supply chain management 
The decision to purchase by the consumer is supported by the
demand processes of defining the value proposition of the product
and service features to a specified customer  And by
carrying out the supply process of receiving orders and order fulfillment 
The purchase of the products or services is
integrated with the demand processes of transactional processing,
delivery and the supply process of physical distribution of products 
The last phase in the customer buying is consumption of the products 
The information flow regarding consumption helps the marketers to design demand
management processes to improve customer service, sell more of
Demand chain management aims to create value to the customers by
the same product to this customer that is upselling,
sell related products to the same customer that is cross selling 
The information and interaction with the customers at this stage
also helps to revise the supply chain processes of physical
distribution and service package offerings 
This is well presented in the infusion model by Rainbird as follows:

worldwide  It has made more than 15 acquisitions since 2001,
enabled supply chain transformation  In the last two
including Nortal Enterprise Solutions,Radvision, HP and
more 
Avaya success is greatly accountable
to its
supply chain transformation and customer
satisfaction 
Moving on to problems faced by Avaya
during 2008-2009 
The company
faced many hurdles
lessons you have learnt about digital supply chain and
way back in 2008-09 
It had the worst-in-class
supply chain in 2008  The supply chain was highly
unreliable and it had very poor relationship with some contract
manufacturers  Supplier terms and conditions were imbalanced 
Their supply chain was inflexible, inefficient and
totally manual 
So, Avaya
suffered from higher inventories,
and long cash-to-cash cycle  Now what was the challenge
applications of IT in various supply chain processes and
faced by Avaya? The company had
made multiple corporate acquisitions which includes
Nortal Enterprise Solutions, Radvision, and HP  After
acquiring Nortal Enterprise solutions in 2009, Avaya found its
supply chain unstable and ineffective 
It had many redundant
processes and multiple IT solutions  But
it suffered from
a holistic view of its entire supply chain network  The
transformation path at Avaya  The company started realizing
activities  In this video lesson we will discuss a real
its mistakes and began to change for good 
The transformation took place
over a period of 4 years
from 2010 to 14 
The transformation began with a new leadership heading supply
chain operations with emphasis on supply chain collaborations
and integration 
Avaya
moved to cloud platform which was totally immature at that time 
It brought in reforms in its sourcing
time case of a company that had drastic transformation in supply
by consolidating among broad suppliers and limited to few
reliable vendors
and it developed
better relationships with those few vendors  Avaya's supply chain
team had simultaneously built an (sales and operations planning)
team to improve communications
across the company with the help of
rapid-response tools and initiatives  It shifted its
working model to on-demand planning process through real
time communications between sales and its supply base  The
chain operations
company also had practiced vendor managed inventory and it
created distributor predictive model to identify over stocking
and under stocking of SKU 
Transportation 'sandbox' allowed
suppliers to model changes in freight method 
Further,
non-value adding work were identified and automated  Avaya
also improved its forecasting abilities through product
lifecycle monitoring, real time inventory data
and with
through
customer relationship management data 
It also improved its collaboration with sales and
finance department 
Finally,
it worked on improving its dashboards and
web portals with focus on accuracy and connectivity with
all stakeholders  Outcomes
of the transformation at Avaya 
The efforts
taken up by Avaya
careful planning and implementation of IT  Avaya is
have brought best-in-class benchmarks to the company by
2017  Presently, Avaya is exceeding industry benchmarks in
11 key metrics  It has reduced its working capital tied in
inventory by 94%  Simultaneously, it has seen
224% improvement in inventory turnover and has achieved on-
time shipments by 97%  Further supply chain visibility of the
company has improved drastically  It has also reduced
air freight by 75%,
inventory has reduced by 85%
and on the whole Avaya was able to reduce its supply chain

Dear learners! Business intelligence and analytics are the buzzwords in
chain analytics and thinking supply chain  By the end of the
session, the learners will be able to appreciate the
application of supply chain analytics for information-driven
supply chains and identify supply chain processes that can
use supply chain analytics  Now, let us move on to the first
lesson on concepts and components of business
analytics  Business analytics, the data-driven analysis of
business processes is an activity wherein big data is
mined to enhance business intelligence  The three
important aspects of business analytics are: Business
all strategic areas across all industries  Business analytics
intelligence, big data and data warehouses, data mining and
business analytics  Business intelligence consists of data
analysis intending to uncover the hidden patterns and trends
to gain insights into the future  BI is a technology-
driven process for: Organizing internal and external data,
preparing queries, creating reports, dashboards, data
visualization, and analytical results to support strategic and
operational decisions  Some noteworthy BI tools are: SAP
analytics, Yellowfin, Tableau, Power BI and Sisense  The open-source
BI tools are: Redash, Metabase, Google Data Studio, Google sheets,
referred to as knowledge discovery in databases started
and Apache zeppelin  Big data consists of huge data and data
handling architecture that is data warehouse, data modelling
languages and programs, online analytical processing, and data
cubes that process, store, and facilitate data analysis  The
data warehouse is a collection of databases that are subject-
oriented, integrated, time-variant, and non-volatile  OLAP is a
component of big data handling architecture that consists of
relational databases, data mining, and reporting mechanisms
to answer multi-dimensional analytical queries  Data
warehouses and OLAP tools are based on a multidimensional data
as data mining and moved to big data analytics  The module on
cube defined by dimensions that is (entities) and facts for which
the organization maintains records  Data mining and
business analytics  Data mining discovers hidden knowledge,
meaningful patterns and new rules using data mining
algorithms and data Analytics  Data analytics uses statistical
techniques and big data to identify patterns and
correlations while business analytics uses big data tools to
support business decisions by analyzing the effectiveness of
procedures and other metrics to growth  The relationship between
data mining and business intelligence is that of a cause
supply chain analytics covers three lessons: Business
and effect  The cause is about what of a database and the
effect is about how and why 
In supply chain analytics, business intelligence, big data,
and data mining all work together to provide solutions
for responsiveness, agility, and productivity 
Supply chain analytics focuses on making sense to the data by
uncovering patterns and generating insights from the
data collected across the supply chain activities 
The different types of supply chain analytics are: Descriptive
analytics that presents the what of a supply chain and the
analytics concepts and components, supply chain
performance as dashboards and reports  Diagnostic analytics
identify the why and how of the supply chain performance through
root cause analysis (RCA), online analytical processing (OLAP), and
what-if analytics 
Predictive Analytics is to for see the most likely outcomes
and future supply chain scenarios and their
implications  Prescriptive analytics solve business
problems and help collaboration with supply chain partners,
optimization and integration of disruptions 
Cognitive analytics solves complex supply chain problems
analytics portfolio and characteristics, supply chain
like a human being with high speed and accuracy by applying
cognitive techniques like artificial intelligence  In
short, supply chain analytics is a data-driven technology wherein
big data is mined to enhance business performance 
Bernard Marr in his book "Big Data" says "The world is getting
smarter  The marriage between data and technology is
radically changing the world and making it smarter and smarter 
Businesses became smarter and companies that do not enhance
the smart revolution will be left behind "
The technology embedded SMART model of business indicates
analytics OLAP operations  The learning objectives of this
start with strategy, measure metrics and data, apply
analytics, report results and transform business  This
indicates supply chains are smart  They embrace technology
that measures metrics and data, apply analytics and report
results to transform supply chain strategy for business

Data warehouses and OLAP tools are based on multi dimensional data
model called data cube, or data cube is defined by dimensions and facts 
Dimensions are the perspectives or entities across which the records are maintained 
An example is a 4- dimensional data cube for sales
with dimensions time,item, location and supplier 
Each cuboid represents a different degree of summarization 
First dimension represents time, item location and supplier 
2d represents a combination of two dimensions,
Dear learners, Online Analytical Processing,
3d represents a combination of three dimensions,
and 4d represents all dimensions 
A data warehouse, however, requires a concise,
subject oriented scheme that can facilitateonline data analysis
and the example of data scheme for OLAP with dimensions is as follows 
Music
The typical OLAP operations for multi dimensional data
can be described and illustrated as follows 
Imagine that there are 4 retail partners in your supply chain
who sell your various products 
referred to as OLAP is a data analytic tool to answer multi dimensional queries 
The central cube in your data warehouse
contain data in dimensions, retailer, time and item
where a retailer is aggregated to retailer value 
Time is aggregated to quarters
and the item is aggregated to itemtype 
The measure displayed is sales value in thousands 
The various OLAP operations that you can perform are as follows
Roll up:The roll up operations
also called the drill-up operation performs aggregation on a data cube
by climbing up a concept hierarchy
In diagnostic analytics,
for operations performed on the central cube  For example,
consider a sales data cube containing only two dimensions retailer and time 
Roll-up may be performed by removing the time dimension,
resulting in an aggregation of total sales to retailer 
Supply_chain_Management_3438
Drill down, it navigates to a detail the data
by either stepping down a concept hierarchy
or a dimension or introducing additional dimensions 
For example, dilton occurs by descending the time hierarchy
from the quarter to a more detailed level of a month 
the OLAP tools are used for data visualization
The resulting data cube details the total sales per month
rather than summarizing them by quarters 
Slice and dice: A slice operation
where the sales are selected from the central cube for the dimension time,
using the criterion time is equal to Q one 
Supply_chain_Management_3450
Pivot:Pivot or rotate is a visualization
operationthat rotates the data axis
in view to provide an alternative presentation of the data 
Some OLAP systems offer drilling operations like drill across executes,
and data mining of multi dimensional data cubes 
queries involving more than one fact table 
Drill through operation uses a relational SQL facilities
to drill through the bottom level of the data cube
down to its back-end relational tables
and ranking the top in or bottom in items OLAP offers
analytical modeling capabilities including
our calculation engine, for deriving ratios, variances and so on,
and computing measures across multi dimensions
and at every dimension intersection 
OLAP also supports function models for forecasting,
In this lesson, we will discuss the OLAP operations
trend analysis and statistical analysis 
Visibility do into in supply chain
is something that every production planner and logistics manager wants 
An OLAP engine is a powerful data analysis tool
for supply chain management  Thank you and an exercise for you all 
There are 5 suppliers who sell your products
that is item A, B, C, D and E 
The central cube in your data warehouse contains data in dimensions supplier,
time and item, where a supplier is aggregated to supplier code,
time is aggregated for quarter and the item is aggregated to the item type 
from the supply chain management perspective 
The measure displayed is sales value in thousands

Dear learners, In this lesson, we have seen the introduction
for a predictive analytics  in the next lesson we will be
continuing with the models and the algorithms used in
predictive analytics  Happy learning 
In all business sectors nowadays,
there is a common prevailing scenario ofpeer competitors,
uncertain market conditions and so on 
Here predictive models are applied to analyze the patterns
in the existing transactional and historical data
for forecasting the future with a certain degree of accuracy 
Dear learners, I welcome you all
In other words, predictive analytics embraces
a variety of statistical techniques from data mining,
predictive modeling, machine learning,artificial intelligence,
deep learning algorithms that use the historical and current data
to make the predictions on the forthcoming or unknown events 
Building the predictive analytics model helps to assess
the risksand to make the right decisions
to improve the overall profit of the system 
Predictive Analytics finds its application in various sectors namely
healthcare, marketing, insurance, telecommunications,
to learn the module titled predictive analytics in supply chain management 
retail, travel, financial services, etc 
Why does predictive analytics matter?
3 main things to know here are  The first one is
Big data on the rise  Predictive Analytics concept
finds its close association with big data 
that is enormous data flowing from sensors,
other instruments and connected systems in the real world 
On contrary, the company's business data might include
transaction data, sales data, customer data,
marketing information, etc  Increasingly,businesses are
The objectives of this module is to let you understand
expected to make data driven decisions and predictions in stipulated time 
The second point is,the growing competition 
As the peer competition increases,
companies need to establish and prove the
quality and standard of the products besides improving theirprofit too 
Here predictive models which are driven by data
come to the rescue to solve business problems 
The third point is the front end technologies 
To deal with big data tools such as Hadoop and Spark which are commonly used
hear data arrives from heterogeneous sources
the need and use of predictive analytics  To
in variety,at high speed that is velocity
and in high amount, which is the volume 
With such large data, tools are necessary to derive
intelligent information using clear understanding and analysis of data 
Machine learning techniques including
neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees,
linear and nonlinear regression, and other classification,
clustering and prediction algorithms extend a helping hand here 
Now we'll see the predictive analysisprocess 
The predictive analytics process comprises of the following steps 
delineate the uses, applications and advantages of predictive analytics 
The first one is defining the project 
Here the project's objectives,
scope, data set usedand expected outcomes are stated 
The second is data collection 
The data is collected from the hetrogenous sources 
The third one is data analysis  Here data is analyzed 
In the form of data examination, cleaning
and modeling data with a motive of deriving useful information 
The fourth one is statistical analysis 
Statistical models are applied to validate the
To promote the application of predictive analytics
assumptions and hypothesis fixed already 
The fifth one is the modeling 
Here predictive models are created using suitable machine learning algorithms 
The sixth one is deployment 
Designed a model is test run to get results and reports
which are the automated outcome of the decision based modeling process 
The seventh and last step is the monitoring 
Here the performance of the model is surveyed to ensure
that it is providing the expected results 
, actually in the face, the business analytics phases, there are 3
in supply chain management  At the end of this module,
phases totally, which are the predictive analytics,
prescriptive analytics and descriptive analytics 
,among this, the descriptive analytics
is put in the first place  Predictive analytics
finds the position in second 
The third one is the prescriptive analytics 
, what do you mean by this?
The first one to ask the right question,
on par with the descriptive analytics we will be asking what happened and why?
, the same thing for predictive analytics,
you will gain knowledge on predictive analytics
we will interpret as what will happen?
The same thing for prescriptive analytics,
We will take us what should be done?
the tools and methodologies used for predictive analytics
here arestatistical modeling and simulation 
For prescriptive analytics,we use heuristics
and optimization models  For descriptive analytics,
we use data aggregation and mining 
,the applications are in predictive analytics

For the next one is the outlier model 
This detects anomaly data and the fraudulent data 
The next one is the time series model 
This model captures data over a period of time for prediction 
Dear Learners,Welcome back to lesson 2 
with the existing models, the major algorithms
that are used for creating the predictive modelsare as follows 
The first one is the random forest model 
This algorithm creates a multitude of decision trees at training time,
and outputting the class that is the mode of classes,
or mean prediction of individual trees 
This is capable of handling both classification
and regression to classify large data 
The second algorithm is generalized linear model 
This is used for analyzing the effects of continuous variables
In the previous lesson,we saw the predictive analytics introduction,
on a discrete or continuous dependent variable 
It helps in predicting the behavior of complex systems,
financial and biological data 
The next one is the gradient boosted model 
This produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of
other weak prediction models 
This builds the model in a stagewise fashion
and generalizes them by allowing optimization of an
arbitrary differentiable loss function 
The next is k means algorithm This algorithm finds k clusters in a set of data,
its applications its needs,
where cluster is a group of data pointswith similar features
that are grouped together  The centroids of K clusters are used
to label the new data The next algorithm is named profit algorithm 
This is used mainly for prediction of time series data
that have strong seasonal effects
and several seasons of historical data 
The next one is the linear model 
This uses the statistical method linear regression
for predictive model construction 
The next one is the decision tree which is also known as
and benefits, various benefits of predictive analytics 
classification and regression tree or CART in short 
This is a sequence of branching operations
depicted in the form of tree based on comparisons of some quantities,
the comparisons being a assigned unit computational cost 
The next one is support vector machine,
which is used in machine learning for classification 
This segregates 2 classes with the hyperplane 
This is commonly used for classification, sometimes for clustering also 
Next one is the Naive Bayes algorithm 
This Naive Bayes classifies a assumes the presence of
,in this lesson,we'll be seeing the predictive analytics models
one feature in a class that is not related to any other 
This is every pair of future being classified as independent of each other

and its applications in supply chain management 
All the very best, happy learning 
The activities needed here to determine channel capacity
and distribution intensity level,
to manage relationship in the supply chain,
to manage all the logistical components that are part of supply chain,
to effectively manage the cost
down the supply chain until the end customer 
Dear learners, welcome back to lesson 3 on
Predictive analytics are increasingly important to supply chain management,
making the process with more precision,
reliability and reduced cost 
,in the supply chain management system,
the uncertainity arises due to the following reasons,
inflated orders,long lead times, late deliveries,
product changes batch ordering, price fluctuations and discounts,
incomplete shipments, inaccurate demand forecasting 
The various information technology tools and echnologies that enabling SCM,
are electronic data interchange,
reductive analytics in supply chain management 
radio frequency identification RFID,
e business,internet, barcode and point of sale 
With advancements in technology and data growth 
There is a strong requirement of quick response
for any organization to keep up with the escalating competition 
This forces the supply chain management system
to adopt the suiting technology to grow their business,
besides preserving the providing benefits 
For this many of the available predictive models,
combining data mining and machine learning techniques extend a helping hand 
The previous 2 lessons,we saw about the predictive analytics need
The architecture recommended here
has the following details 
Applications of predictive analytics is expected to have a clear and
positive impact on improving the accuracy of forecasts 
Product tracing and offering growth paths 
It is identified and classified the use cases for
supply chain analytics based on importance and level of adoption 
These included inventory level optimizations,
production and sourcing optimizations reduce cost,
identifying and resolving quality defects and root causes,
and applications benefits, followed by
identifying product costs variances,
analyzing customer service level performance,
tracking product traceability, analyzing forecast
accuracy andmany more 
Organizations can use predictive insights for supply chain
and logistics in the following ways 
The first one is the improved personalization 
Here based on customer's needs and his geographical location,
predictive models may be used to optimize delivery of goods 
Second one is predict to maintenance 
the predictive models and algorithms commonly used 
In transport operations for picking
and packing ,optimized technology driven system
helps to move supply chain logistics successfully 
The next one is industrial procurement 
Based on customer's demand and buying pattern,
inventory and shipment may be planned well in advance 
Next is product and content placement 
Other supply chain influencing factors such as weather,unusual incidents, etc 
for behaviors changes may be prepared in a better way 
The predict side supply and demand is the next one 
,in this lesson, we'll be seeing the application of predictive analytics
Here at peak season less waste of products
and on time delivery of goods may be ensured 
Next is customer visibility 
Insights about suppliers, customers and business partners
may be analyzed and taking
quicker action and intelligent decision is done here 
Next is third party logistics 
Technology partners may be outsourced if necessary 
Next is transportation management system 
Uncertainties that arise in transportation and
and foreward supply chain management 
shipping may be handled efficiently 
Overall, the predictive models are expected todo the following  
To predict the on time delivery of goods using
data driven machine learning methodology 
To collect data from heterogeneous sources, clean and combine
to sift out useful information 
To incorporate business intelligence tools
to diagnose customer data 
To identify the reasons for error occurrence and able management 
The machine learning algorithms such as
Supply Chain Management is the management of a network of
random forest, support vector machine,
and gradient boosting may be applied to train the transactional data set
that helps in identifying the
likelihood of day late delivery and returns 
,the various ways machine learning
or artificial intelligenceis revolutionizing SCM or as follows 
The new approach and insights from
machine learning have greater impact on supply chain management activities 
The one, first point is at supplier level,
the transportation quality may be measured using
interconnected business activities involved in
interests of marketing and supply chain processes 
This is achieved by supply chain processes by obtaining timely
information from marketing on trends in new customers or
product, customer segments, promotional plans and over or
under delivery and providing information on lead time,
capacity and cost of supply chains  On having understood the
phases in demand chain management and the role of
supply chain  Let us conclude the module on integrated
customer lifecycle, demand management and supply chain
management with the conceptual model  The exercise for you at the
the phases in demand management, we note that demand chain
end of the modules is, visit the retail outlet and map the

management aims to create value to the customers by combining
the strengths of marketing and supply chain competencies 
The four phases of demand chain management is as follows:
In the previous lesson, we also understood the first phase of
demand management from the fusion model of integrated
customer lifecycle, demand processes and supply processes 
We look into the next three phases and the role of supply chain management 
Phase two of demand management is managing digital integration 
Managing the information flow across the
Dear learners in the last lesson we covered what is demand management and the
demand management processes and supply processes is an
important component of business processes, this provides
necessary information for customer buying decisions 
To meet the requirement, organizations implement systems
that enables seamless information flow and knowledge
enabled processes across the supply and demand chains 
They ensure that the information flow is well integrated 
With the advent of information technology,
the organizations employ digital integration 
So, What is digital integration?
first phase in demand management that is integrating demand and
Digital integration means linking the processes through information technology
and it includes both information systems and technology 
In supply and demand processes, digital integration links, the customer
relationship activities, logistical functions and strategic decisions,
this is done by integrating the
transactional systems management information systems, decision
support systems and stategic systems  And by integrating the
various modules of enterprise resource planning, enterprise
operations, enterprise planning and monitoring, enterprise
integration and administration, customer relationship
supply processes  In this session, we will discuss the
management, supply chain management and financial and
operations reporting  We will learn this in detail under
supply chain information systems and now let us conclude
that digital integration is an important function of demand
chain and supply chain management  As it enables timely
information flow for carrying out the operations and management
decisions, sales and customer purchase history when integrated
with procurement, manufacturing, inventory and logistics can
propel demand forecasting, product improvement, customised
offerings, customer specific sales promotions and mode of
next three phases namely digital integration, configuring the
physical distribution  Digital integration is important
to manage customer connectivity, smart procurement, order
fulfillment, service delivery and supplier collaboration 
In the traditional environment, each functional area, namely
operations, finance, human resource and marketing were
viewed separately  Hence, the challenge in digital integration
is to identify the information, interdependency and integrate the processes 
This has led to the next phase in demand management as
configuring the value systems and establishing
cross functional relationships  Phase-III Configuring the Value Systems 
value systems and establishing cross functional relationships 
The strategic objective of organizations is to satisfy
the customers better than the compititors 
The customers prioritize, quality, variety, delivery time and after sale
service at minimum cost  The organizations today meet this
expectation of customers by adding value to the customers
across the value chain activities of inbound logistics,
operations, outbound logistics, marketing and after sales service 
The supporting activities namely administration,
finance, accounting, information technology
and human resources are also tuned towards achieving
By the end of the lesson, we will highlight the role of
competitive advantage  In short, as all the organisational
functions are tuned towards adding value to the customers,
the value system of demand chain and supply chain are also
designed to meet the needs of the customer segments with
differentiated and customized products and services 
Phase-IV Managing Across Functional Relationship  Activities of
supply chain and demand chain spreads across all the
functional activities across the value chain as follows:
The value chain activity of new product development is linked to
the demand chain processes of market analysis, segmentation,
supply chain and demand chain processes across the customer lifecycle 
targeting, forecasting, defining value proportion and the supply
chain processes of supplier network monitoring, supplier
collaboration, procurement strategy and logistics 
The value chain activity of operations is interrelated with
demand chain processes of creation and delivery of the
value propositions and supply chain processes of logistics,
inventory management, material and information flow 
And so is the value chain activity of marketing and sales
to the demand processes of physical distribution, cross selling
and upselling and supply chain processes of physical
Let us move on to the phases in demand management 
distribution and service offerings  The value chain
activity of surfaces is supported by the demand chain
process of despatching, customising services and
offering services and the supply chain processes of monitoring
service networks, installation and maintenance service 
This explanation of interdependency imposes the challenges of conflicting
key performance indicators  "Key performance
indicators is a measurement used to evaluate the success of an activity "
The success of supply chain processes is
determined by the effectiveness to overcome the conflicting

Music
Dear learners, Supply Chain Management spreads across all the activities
,we will move on to the first lesson
in supply chain analytics 
Music
Supply chain optimization and business analytics 
Music
Optimization means making the best of everything 
In management terms, it indicates the application of all resources
to maximize returns and minimize cost 
Music
Supply Chain optimization is the process of applications of tools and techniques
Music
to reduce costs and improve performance
of all the supply chain activities 
Music
In supply chain management, tools and techniques are applied
to improve productivity and waste reduction 
This has led to process reengineering in 2 areas:
Music
Cost reduction by identification of cost centers,
dwell time through transportation, ideal capacity and excess inventory 
Music
that are from inbound logistics to after sales services
Improve the agility of the supply chain
through real time demand signals,
Music
just in time inventory,flexible operations and strategic facility locations 
Music
In short,business chain optimization tools and techniques
are applied across the key components of supply chain
Music
from demand forecasting to production management,
Music
and even a little cost reduction or efficiency maximization
operations scheduling, inventory management,
network management, logistics management and reverse logistics 
Music
The operational and strategic decisions of effective supply chain indicated
Music
the various supply chain optimization areas as
dynamic forecasting and aggregate planning,
Music
strategic sourcing and purchase process supported by
transactional processes systems 
will lead to value addition and competitiveness 
Effective transportation and inventory management through
strategic dwell time reduction,
Music
capacity utilization and shortening lead time 
Music
Internal integration strategies using ERP 
Music
External integration through effective outsourcing
and integration across verticals 
Music
Music
Cost reduction and quick response through lean green and agile supply chains 
Music
Across all the optimization initiatives,
the role of information technology is tremendous,
Music
and it has moved to the extent of implementing thinking supply chains 
Music
For example, Amazon has started to use robotics
Music
in its order fulfillment centers and termed it as robotic fulfillment centers 
The organisations implemented many techniques like
and C2 ,C4 and C5 as a set 
These sets are prune using the Apriori property 
All non empty subsets of the frequent item set must also be frequent 
Do any of the candidates have a subset that is not frequent?
For example, the two item subsets of C1, C2
C 3 are C1, C2 ,C 1, C3 and C2, C3  
Allare members of L2  Therefore, keep
C1, C2, C3 in C3 
Similarly,keep C1, C2, C5 in C3 
There 2 items subsets of C1, C3, C5
Frequent patterns are patterns that are item sets, sub sequences,
are C1 and C3, C1 and C 5 and C3 and C5,
C3 and C5 is not a member of L 2 and so, it is not frequent 
Similarly,a set of C1 ,C 3,C4 
A set of C2 ,C3 and C5 and a set of C2, C4 and C5
is not a frequent member of a L2 
, it is not frequent and they are removed 
Therefore, after pruning C3 is equal to
a set of C1 ,C2, C3 and C1 , C2, C5 
The transaction in D are scanned in order to determine L3
consisting of those candidate item 3 as
or sub structures that appear in a data set frequently 
sets having minimum support 
The algorithm uses L 3 into L3 , to generate
a candidate set of 4 item sets  C4 ,Although the joint results in
C1, C2, C3 and C5 as a set 
This item set is pruned because it's subset C2, C3 and C5
is not frequent  Thus C4 is null and the algorithm
terminates having formed all of the frequent itemsets 
The example demonstrates that the apriori_gen procedure
performs 2 kinds of actions, namely join and prune 
For example, for an automobile manufacturer,
Every frequent pattern generates multiple association rules
that are filtered based on score criteria like confidence and lift 
Many variations of Apriori algorithm
have been proposed to improve efficiency  Some variations are:
Hash based technique: technique that is shredding items
into corresponding brackets 
Transaction reduction: Reducing the number of
transactions scanned in future iterations 
Partitioning, Segregating the data to find candidate item set 
Sampling: Mining on a subset of a given data 
if he considers the data set of
Dynamic itemset counting: Adding candidate item sets
are different points during the scan 
Thank you learners  This lesson introduced you to one of
the basic algorithms of frequent pattern mining that is used for
generating association rules 
Thank you and see you all in the next session 
Find 2 applications of frequent pattern mining
for supply chain optimization
and present it as an exercise  Thank you 
purchase of various components from the supplier base and
data pattern can contain an itemset subsequence or substructure 
A set of set of items for example, horns and navigation instrumennts
appear frequently together in a transaction data
of suppliers then it is called frequent items set 
A subsequent such as or customer buying the car first, then various additional
Dear learners in the previous lesson, we have discussed
components or accessories like high end speakers, stickers etc

The process of building association rules consists of 2 steps 
Step 1 is finding association rules
and it consists of choosing the right set of items 
Generating rules by interrupting the counts in the
co occurrence table 
Step 2 is generating rules from all the data 
The general algorithm use is an iterative process
to generate association rules as follows

Apriori some basic algorithm for finding frequent itemsets 
It was proposed by R  Agarwal and R  Srikant in
1994 for mining frequent itemsets 
Apriori property indicates that
all non empty subsets of a frequent item set must also be frequent 
,this lesson focuses on
This property belongs to a category of properties called
antimono tone, and implies that if a set cannot pass a test,
all of its subsets will fail the same test as well 
The Apriori algorithm is based on the fact that the algorithm uses
prior knowledge of frequent itemset properties 
It is an iterative approach
usinga Apriori property and employs a level wise search,
where k itemsets are used to explore k plus 1 item sets 
The iterative process of Apriori algorithm
based on candidate generation is called
introducing the learners to a prior algorithm
Prune and Join and it follows
the set of frequent 1 item set is found by scanning the database
to count for each item that satisfies minimum support 
The resulting set is denoted as L1  
Next L1 is used to find L2 ,
the set of frequent 2- itemsets which is used to find L3,
and so on, until requent k- item sets cannot be found 
A simple example is imagine a large scale manufacturer
who outsources various components from various suppliers
want to optimize its order processing,
for association rule generation with an example 
transportation,and inventory by focusing on suppliers
who supply multiple components 
The organization scans the transactional data
of each supplier to understand
frequent components purchase from each supplier 
Support of minimum 2 is set
and the data set is searched 
Let us consider the following data set of the auto components supplier order 
Data for car manufacturer 
The Apriori algorithm for finding frequent item
Music
set in data set D is as follows 
In the first iteration,the algorithm simply scans all the
transactions in order to count the number of co occurrence of each item 
Supply_chain_Management_4387
Frequent item set (L1) is generated by comparing
candidate support count with minimum support count 
Here the minimum support count is 2 and all the items in C 1
satisfy minimum support 2
and each subset of the candidate is frequent 
Frequent item set is generated by joining L1 into L1
Association rules which reflect patterns of data are generated
to generate a candidate set of 2 items sets 
Next, the order transaction in D, are scanned and support count
of each candidate item set in C2 is presented 
The set of frequent 2 items set in C2 having minimum support is generated 
At level 3, they joined C 3, that is C2 into C2 
And you will find the subsets to B, C1, C2, C3

What do you understand by the word fuzzy?
Music
It is something not clear or vague 
Music
is
Music
In many situations,
in all the activities in business 
Music
we cannot describe a condition or an event or a relationship as true or false 
It might be partially true and such situations are termed as fuzzy

As many times we cannot determine whether the state is true or false 
Music
It can be partially true, partially false 
Music
And the answer might lie between

true and false 
Music
Music
This is the foundation of fuzzy logic 
Music
, what is fuzzy logic? In traditional Boolean logic,
the state of a condition is viewed to be true or false
and the truth value is either 0 or 1 
Music
In fuzzy logic,the state of condition can be true,partially true, partially false
and false and the truth value can range from 0 and 1

detail, the supply chain operations reference model 
The third lesson will briefly explain the other supply chain
operations reference models The objectives of the module is to
provide information of metrics for supply chain performance,
and elaborate on supply chain models for performance management 
The learning outcome of the module is : by the end of the
session you will be able to identify and associate
performance metrics across the supply chains 
Apply Supply Chain Management models 
Welcome learners, we will move on to the first lesson on supply
Supply Chain Models  Dear learners, a supply chain model is
chain performance management and supply chain models 
A supply chain is a global network of raw materials and merchandise
suppliers, manufacturers, logistics partners,
distributors, retailers and consumers who are linked through
flow of products and services, information and funds to meet
the customer need  The integrated supply chain points
out that performance of supply chain it's not only the
performance of internal supply chain that is the manufacturers
or firm level, but it is the sum of performance of internal
supply chain, the performance of supply chain partners that is
a conception or quantitative model that explains the
the suppliers and distributors and the performance of extended
supply chains of collaborators and outsourcing partners etc 
Supply chains are focused on fulfilling customer needs by
value creation for end customer satisfaction  And so the supply
chain performance is measured by responsiveness, reliability and
total cost of the entire supply chain 
With this brief understanding, we will look into the supply chain performance
management systems and supply chain models 
Supply chain performance measures and metrics 
The supply chain performance measures are classified into 2 :
operations, relationships, systems, networks decision
Traditional performance measures and distinctive competitive
performance measures  The traditional measures include use
of financial and stakeholders data analysis, to understand the
cost, revenue and profitability and the use of productivity and
turnover measures that is output to cost of inputs ratios 
The measure can include total productivity, or factor wise
productivity like material productivity, and labour productivity 
Distinctive competitive performance measures 
Distinctive Competitive performance measures identify
all the supply chain activities are linked to the firm's
framework or an aspect of supply chain  In this module we will be
objectives and customer satisfaction  The performance
measures across the capability areas namely quality, cost and
customer service, environmental performance  According to Gary S & J  P 
The specific supply chain performance measures on
total supply chain management cost, supply chain cash to cash cycle :
Production Flexibility : delivery, perfect order
fulfillment, E-business performance, Environment performance 
we will move on to the understanding the role of
supply chain operations in relations to supply chain performance 
Performance management and supply chain models 
learning on Supply Chain Management models for
The supply chain council has recognized supply chain
models to integrate supply chains and to measure the
performance of supply chain partners  The model spreads
across the entire supply chain from raw material supplier to
the end customer and covers three major areas, namely Market
Interactions, Transactional interactions and Customer interactions 
The market interactions covers all processes from
market analysis and demand forecasting to delivery of products and services 
The transaction interactions are all transactions and decisions from
idea generation to product development, delivery and services 
performance management  The module is presented as 3 lessons 
It involves end to end transactions and information
exchange between suppliers, distributors and customers 
Customer interactions includes the entire supply chain
processes across customer buying cycle from need identification
to purchase and consumption of products and services 
The supply chain models are designed to define and diagnose supply
chain processes and performances  To reengineer the processes
and benchmark the best practices  The popular supply chain models are
Supply Chain Operations Reference model,
Design Chain Operations Reference model,
The first lesson will explain supply chain performance
Customer Chain Operations Reference model,
Managing the supply chain performance,
Product Life Cycle Operation Reference model 
With this introduction to performance metrics and supply chain models,
I request you to ponder on the following points 
Identify the supply chain processes,
and define performance metrics for businesses like swiggy and zomato 
Thank you and meet you all in the next session on supply chain models 
Music
and performance metrics and supply chain models for
performance management  The second lesson will deal in
Integrate and implement best practices of supply chain management 
Components, Performance Processes, Practices and People 
With this explanation of SCOR a self-study exercise for you 
Identify the SCOR framework of any company and brief the SCOR process levels 
Thank you
Music
Organizations have successfully integrated SCOR
model into their business framework and noted that SCOR
resulted in reduced inventory, enhance customer service,
streamlined Supply Chain processes and redefined organizational supply chain,
improved operational flexibility 
And now we will look into the SCOR model components and the
structure under the following headings 5 process blocks,
level of process and performance measures across the process elements
and components of SCOR  SCOR process blocks 
The 5 processes in SCOR are Plan, Source, Make, Deliver, and Return 
Dear learners, in this session we will discuss supply chain
The plan includes processes that refer to demand and supply planning 
The sub processes are
leveraging resources with requirements Designing business
rules related to inventory, capital assets, logistics
and compliances to regulatory standards  Communication plans
for supply chain defining standards to improve and measure supply chain efficiency 
Sources includes all processes to procure raw materials,
stocks make to order and engineer to order goods
or services to meet the real or anticipatory demand 
It include processes related to scheduling, procurement
operations reference model in detail 
and deliveries, identifying, selecting and establishing
supplier networks, order placement, fulfillment and
authorizing payments, inventory management, managing supplier
agreements and supplier relationship  Assessing supplier
performance monitoring material acquisition and sourcing infrastructure 
Make unclearall the processes related to production of
make to stock make to order and engineer products 
It includes scheduling production activities, managing
work-in-progress, equipment, facilities and the production network 
delivery includes all processes related to outbound logistics
Supply Chain Operations reference model is a framework
from moving the product from the place of manufacture to the customer 
It includes customer and processes of order
management, from receiving order enquiry to delivery, developing
quotes and roping shipment  logistics, product life cycle
management finished inventory management, managing compliances
related to sales, imports and exports  Return inputs all
processes to handle the returns of materials purchase to the
suppliers and returns of finished goods from the customers 
It involves application of return policies
developed by the organization's authorization and scheduling
for performance analysis and performance
returns, receiving verifying and reverse logistics of products,
replacement and reverse logistics, regulatory compliance
and asset management, after sales customer support
and follow up SCOR describes the prisoners activities
to satisfy the customer demand  The activities are organised
across the supply chains around the 5 process blocks
namely Plan, Source, Make, Deliver and Return 
How do organizations implement SCOR framework?
The 4 steps SCOR implementation
process includes level 1, defining scope and process type 
enhancement across the supply chain 
Level 2, configuration of process categories to supply
chain process types  Level 3, defining process elements 
Level 4, implementation of supply chain
management practices by integrating processes, metrics,
best practices and execution of supply chain  At level one of
defining scope and process categories, the organization
select the supply chain process categories and select
performance attributes that best describes them 
Therefore performance attributes are realiability, responsiveness,
agility, cost and asset management efficiency 
Is a tool employed by manufacturing and service industries
At level 2 and 3, the SCOR processes are defined as
process type, process elements, process flow diagrams,
and tasks to be achieved  The inputs, process elements,
outputs and performance metrics for each process element within
the flow diagram is defined  Best practices can also be
identified at this level  Supply chain management
practices are identified and implemented 
The level 4 involves integrating business process re-engineering,
benchmarking and best practice analysis with SCOR framework
and implementing supply chain management practices
to analize, benchmark and Improve the processes of supply chain management 
for enhanced supply chain performance 
The 3 techniques at this level are business process re-engineering,
Redesign the core supply chain activities to meet the future competitive markets 
benchmarking, quantifying the supply chain
operations performance with similar companies and best
industry practices  Best Practice analysis, characterize
the management practices and software solutions that result
in superior performance  The 4 components of score model
are performances, metrics for evaluating supply chain process
performance, and defining the strategic goals
It is a management tool used to communicate supply chain
processes, management processes and process relationship 
Practices, management practices for better supply chain performance,
people skills and competencies of people to perform supply chain procesess 
To sum up, supply chain operations reference model is a
framework to describe, measure and evaluate supply chain processes 
The major elements of SCOR model are process blocks, Plan,
Source, Make, Deliver and Return  Process levels, defined
scope, process catagories and performance metrics 
Configure process pipes to supply chain processes 
Defined process elements, workflows, and related performance metrics 
decisions within a company, suppliers and customers of a company
resources and talent development with business strategies 
It provides knowledge on how to implement well defined and
repeatable supply chain processes  M4SC is about
layered management of supply chain in line with business
strategies  It involves 4 modules  Module 1 is managing
supply chain strategies, how to manage supply chain strategies 
Managing supply chain strategies involve segmenting businesses
into supply chain and determining performance 
The activities include business plan analysis, supply chain
segmentation, supply chain SWOT analysis, supply chain strategy,
As the word indicates, design chain
definition and supply chain GAP analysis  The feedback from the
first layer manage strategy provides feedback for optimizing
supply chain networks for strategic performance requirements 
The second module is managing networks, managing
networks includes supply chain network definition, network
analysis, solution definition, network definition and network
change prioritization  The feedback from the network
definition leads to the next layer of management that is
management of supply chain processes 
The module 3 is manage processes  The third layer of
operations reference model, it focuses on 3 product design
manage processes involved Process flow capture, Process
value stream model, Process RACI analysis that is defining
and understanding the role of various stakeholders in the
supply chain process definations and process change prioritization 
At this level, supply chain processes are
aligned towards strategic network goals  The deliverables from
this layer of management provides insights of next
layer of management that is resource management 
The fourth layer of M4SC is managed resources  The managed resources
involves skill capture and skill resource planning, procedure
environments, namely Product refresh, New product
capture, technology resource planning, organizational review,
planning resources, and resource change prioritization 
Supply chain resources involves continuous alignment of
resources to meet process goals  The 4 layered management as
defined by M4SC leads to well defined scalable supply chain processes 
The supply chain coun presence the M4SC
layered management as follows

Design chain operations reference model is organized
across 5 process blocks related to research and design 
And they are Plan, Research, Design, Integrate and Amend 
Plan involves development and establishment of course of
action and projected design change resources 
Research involves all management processes
Supply chain models  Dear learners, in the last session we discuss the score
of identification of research problem collecting,
synchronizing and evaluating information, publishing and
authenticating the research findings and identification of
source of supply sourcing and validation of materials
and products against requirements 
The design includes process of creation, analysis and testing
the product design, releasing the requirements specifications
of an existing product, and reviewing and adjusting the
processes of sourcing, manufacturing, testing,
servicing and disposal  Integrate is a management process
model and in this session we will look into design chain
that links refreshed products and new product definitions to
supply chain activities  Amend involves management processes
that gather and analyze the issues in product design and manufacturability 
The DCOR structure comprises 3 process types 
The process types are planning processes,
execution processes, and enable process  The planning process of
DCOR includes alignment of expected resources to expected design
requirements and balancing aggregate demand 
The execution process on the other hand, involves scheduling
and sequencing, research and design, material sourcing
operations reference model DCOR, Customer chain operations
and integration and amendment  They enable processes, prepare,
maintain, and manage information and relationship across the
design chain operations  As in the score model DCOR also
has performance metrics and performance attributes 
The performance metrics and performance attributes are as follows 
The performance metrics are perfect product design,
product design change cycle time, total design chain costs,
product design chain change cycle time, design change fixed
assets value  The performance metrics are measured across the
performance attributes namely reliability  Reliability is the
reference model CCOR and Managing for supply chain
performance of the design and it is measured as correct design in
the correct format with correct documentation released are the
correct place and time  Responsiveness is the quickness
at which the design chain delivers the product to the customer 
Flexibility is the time taken to change the product
design, after it is released to the operations  Costing is this cost
of operating the entire design chain  Assets, assets indicate
effectiveness of managing fixed assets and working capital to
support design chain operations  The design chain operations
reference model DCOR provides an unified structure
performance M4SC  we will look into design chain
that links the processes, performance metrics and
practices of research and development business processes 
Next we will discuss the customer operations reference model 
The customer operations, are business activities that
converts the customer needs into an order 
The customer operations reference model is a process framework in SCOR
structure that unifies sales operations and customer support
business processes, metrics and practices  The process blocks
of customer chain operations reference model are Plan, Relate
Sell, Contract and Assist  The plan processes focus on
operations reference model DCOR  The design chain
prioritizing sales activities, Assigning targets and Planning resources 
They relate processes is for development and
establishment of course of action to source and align required
resources to carry out the customer chain operations 
Sell is the process of establishing and monitoring the products and
services offered to the customers  This includes
defining customer profile, scheduling sales, collecting
information from intermediaries, and releasing contract 
The contract process is the process of pricing a product and
gaining customer agreement  It includes receiving the request
operations reference model is a business framework in SCOR structure 
for contract, configuring and pricing the proposal, obtaining
approval, publishing price list, obtaining customer agreement and
closing the deal  Assist is the process of providing after sales
support for products and services offered to the customers 
This includes receiving and logging, post
sales support requirement, assigning support resources,
responding to customers queries, warranty claims
and feedback for products and services  According to CCOR
model, the performance across the customer chain is measured
with the following performance metrics  Customer growth rate,
It describes all business activities that link,
customer conversion rate, cost and revenue, customer franchise
average profit per business assist per customer, perfect
assist, assist cycle time, Cost of assist, net customer loyalty index 
Dear learners, we have discussed the 3 supply chain
models namely SCOR, DCOR, CCOR  And now we will
discuss the framework managing for supply chain performance
that is M4sc  Managing for supply chain performance is
a supply chain framework that links supply chain plans and policies
to business strategies  It is a framework that assimilates
supply chain strategy, supply chain network, supply chain
research and development processes, performance metrics and practices 
members of the supply chain  Through flow of material,
information and funds  The process view of supply chain can
be explained under 2 headings : Cycle view and push and pull view 
What is the cycle view of supply chain?
The cycle view of supply chain indicates that
supply chain is a series of processes performed at
the interface of any 2 stages of supply chain 
This can be understood with an example 
The supply chain of a manufacturer who manufactures
and sells the products through the distributors
Push and Pull supply chain strategies 
and the retailer will undergo 4 major supply
chain processes, that is purchase of raw materials,
manufacturer of products, Distribute and stock the products
with the distributors, deliver the product as the customer
orders through the retailers  This supply chain process when
viewed as a cycle is as follows  The process at the interface
between the supplier and the manufacturer is the procurement cycle 
The process at the next interface between the
manufacturer and the distributor is the manufacturing cycle 
The process at the next link between the distributor and the
Dear learner, welcome you all module on push and pull
retailer is stock replenishment cycle  The process at the next
interface between the retailer and the customer is customer
order fulfillment cycle  The process view of supply chain
indicates that, not all supply chains have to move through all
the interfaces, some supply chains will not have one or more interfaces 
For example, a retailer who does not manufacture the product,
but only sells will not have the manufacturer cycle 
And the manufacturer who distributes the products
through its own retail outlets will not have stock
replenishment cycle at the interface between manufacturer and retailer 
supply chain strategies  In this module, we will discuss the
, we will move on to the next point in the
cycle view of supply chain  The second point indicates that
each cycle consist of various sub processes  The sub processes is triggered
by the orders placed by the customers
or when the demand for the product is anticipated
and then the products are produced, it ends when the product is
delivered and services rendered to the customer 
This subprocesses across the cycle is same as the SCOR model
processes of plan, source, make ,deliver and return 
The supply chain operational decisions are
process view of supply chain, responsiveness of supply chain
based on the process view of supply chain 
and the responsiveness of supply chain  we will move on to
the next category in the process view of supply chain that is
push and pull view of supply chain  The process view of
supply chain is defined as pull or push 
what is push or pull view of supply chain?
The push or pull view of supply chain focuses on
the supply chain responsiveness, the supply chains can
respond to the anticipatory demand of the customer
or after the actual demand from the customer 
and push, pull and postponement strategies in supply chain 
, we will look into the push and pull supply chain
after having an understanding on supply chain responsiveness 
What is supply chain responsiveness?
Supply chain responsiveness is the ability of
the supply chain to cater to the huge quantities demanded 
Respond to the assortments and variety of
products demanded by the customers 
Deliver the products within a short time
after the customer has initiated his demand 
and manage high quality service 
Let us discuss the process view of supply chain now 
Ensure that uncertainties in the supply does not affect the product delivery
and initiate and support the innovative product design and delivery 
The responsiveness of the supply chain can be
triggered at 2 points on anticipation of the future
demand of the customer or in response to the customer order 
The supply chain process in anticipation for the customer
order is push process and the supply chain process in response
to customer order is pull process  In the next session,
we will discuss in detail the push and pull
supply chain processes with example 
What is the process view of supply chain?
Thank you
Music
The process view of supply chain indicates that
supply chain is a sequence of processes that connect the
you towards their store  This is Push strategy 
Likewise, supermarket (B) had also made some attractive displays of some
products near the cash counters  And even though those items are
not in your list, you get attracted and buy a product this is pull strategy 
Supply chain is an integral part of marketing
and customer satisfaction and hence supply
chains are designed to meet push and pull marketing strategies 
we will move on to understand
what is push and pull supply chain strategy?
Push supply chain is also known as anticipatory business model 
Dear learners, after the brief introduction of process view of
In push supply chain strategy, the supply chain function is to supply products
that are manufactured and stock based on the long term demand forecast 
Each partner in the supply chain hold inventory to meet the
anticipatory demand  It is Based on make to stock policy 
When do organizations adapt push supply chain strategy?
Push supply chains are adapted when firms follow the anticipatory business model 
Purchase behavior is not certain  Due to lack of real
time marketing information firms are involved in mass production
and have high volume sales and huge market share 
Manufacturers produce products based on demand
supply chain, we will discuss in detail the push and pull supply chain 
forecast and not after receiving the order 
Firms plan to meet existing demand within short lead time
and then firms want to avoid stock outs 
The challenges when following a push supply chain strategy are :
Forecast not being accurate can led to differences in what the firm
plan to do and what the firm really did  Uncertainity and unplanned inventory 
Inability to meet sudden hike in demand for products or changing demands 
Conflict of interest among the trading partners
and risk of product obsolescence 
In the traditional push strategy, the flow of information products
Push and Pull strategies evolved as marketing concepts
and negotiation is unidirectional,
and it is from manufacturers to the customers 
An example of push supply chain strategies is that
of a retail outlet who anticipate the seasonal demand
changes in readymade garments and accessories  Even before the
summer season the apparel brands design the summer collections
and promote their designs  Other example is the mobile
brands who follow an anticipatory business model
and their supply chain logistics are driven by demand focus
and inventory management  Having understood the push strategy,
and it can be understood as follows  You're having a grocery
now let us move on to pull supply chain or responsive business model 
pull strategies followed by firms that adapt responsive
business model that is made to order philosophy 
The logistics of supply chain is based on real time information of
the point of sale data and is driven by actual customer demand 
The pool supply chain is triggered when customers place order
and this supply chain strategy has advantage of less wastage 
in case of low demand  The supply chain is practised when
manufacturers follow bill to order business strategy 
Scope of customization to meet customer demand is high 
list of items to purchase  At supermarket (A) you don't find the
Supply chain is demand driven  Customer involvement and knowledge
demands direct connectivity  Firms aim at reducing inventory
level and inventory carrying costs  Flexibility to change
customer services to change in demand is mandatory 
But the challenges are inventory shortage to meet
rising demands, flexibility in manufacturing and distribution
demands agile supply chains, customisation of operational
risk of multiple channel partner management, obtaining and
sharing accurate sales data from all supply chain partners is risky 
High cost and risk of shortening the lead time 
items you require  So, you move to the other supermarket (B),
In pull strategy, the information and negotiation flow is not uni-direction
An example of pull supply chain processes 
A fashion designer who produces apparels for customers after receiving
the order and its specification from the customer 
Other examples are computer brands who assemble computers after
receiving customer orders, designing automobile suppliers
and automobile service centers 
Having discussed what is push and pull supply chain,
the advantages and challenges  In the next session,

What is push pull boundary?
Business firm today do not follow pure pull
strategy or pure push strategy  Instead, they have few supply
chain processes based on anticipatory demand and others
based on actual demand  The firms set boundaries as to which of
the supply chain processes should be push processes
and which of them should be pull processes 
This process classification as pull and push processes
sets the push and pull boundary 
For example, if an apparel manufacturer makes
Dear learners in the last session we discuss the practical
100 sweaters of standard size and stock them but dyes the sweaters
based on the real time order and delivers them as ordered
his supply chain and the push and pull boundaries are as follows 
Thus, in practice, the supply chain processes involve
identifying supply chain processes that depends on
anticipatory demand and the others that can focus on actual
demand and defining the push and pull boundary that can match
supply and demand effectively  With the advent of information
technology, the supply chain is designed as pull based push
strategy, wherein the information flow to the customer
application of push and pull chains as follows 
can be directly from the manufacturer or through the
supply chain partners  The product flows from the
manufacturer through the supply chain partners
and the negotiation flow is bi- directional between the
customer and the manufacturer either directly or through the channel partners 
The other examples of push pull boundary
are a computer manufacturer produces the various components
of the computer and holds stock of them but assembles and
delivers the computers only on receiving the customer order 
A Paint manufacturer produces various standard colours of
In this session, we will discuss push pull and postponement strategy
paints and stocks them at retail outlets but mixes the paint and
delivers them as per the customer choice at the retail outlet 
A boutique holds various apparel material in stock
but does designing, stitching, and delivery on scheduled time
after receiving the order from the customer 
The blending of push and pull strategies
as said above has led to supply chain strategy called postponement 
What is postponement strategy? Postponement strategy is
producing and holding inventory of a standard product state
based on anticipated demand but postponing the final
in supply chain in today's business scenario 
manufacturing, customization or distribution of the product
until the customer order is received  The two types of postponement are:
Manufacturing postponement and Geographical postponement 
Manufacturing postponement: Manufacturing or form
postponement involves manufacturing a standard or a
base product in sufficient quantities while holding back
the finalization of customized features until the customer places the order 
For example, a car manufacturer manufactures
the standard car but postpones the customization of the
features like car colour, seats, audio system, etc
With industrial and information technology revolution,
until the customer places the order for the car 
Next is Geographical Postponement  In geographical
postponement the products are manufactured and stocked in one
geographical location but delivery of inventory is
postpone until the customer order is received 
For example, a retail chain that sells its brand across the world
can anticipate the seasonal demand and produce the apparels
and stock it in the central warehouse which is strategically located 
It captures the point of sale data from various retail
outlets and then decides which assortment in what quantity
time based competition is prevailing in all businesses
should be deployed to each region  This is geographical postponement 
Learners having understood the push, pull and
postponement strategies in supply chain, you are requested
to visit any firm and map the supply chain processes
and define their push, pull and postponement strategies 
Thank you all for successfully completing
the second weeks course in supply chain 
Thank you
Music
and this has led to blending of push and pull supply chain strategy 
In supply chain management terms the blending of push and pull supply
chains is termed as push and pull boundaries 
Dear learners! Welcome you all to the module on coordination in
the lead time is say 10 weeks and if the retailer is
forecasting good demand for the product, then the retailer will
order it before 10 weeks so that he is assured of the
product availability  Another problem occurs due to rationing
and shortage gaming  For example, if a product is in high
demand and the supply is limited, then manufacturer
resort to rationing in which they provide less than ordered
quantity to wholesalers or retailers  If retailers orders
10 units he might be given say 5 units  So, what the
retailer might do is, he might order higher quantities say 20
bullwhip effect, understand the ways and means to ensure supply
inorder to get his 10 required units  All these operational
obstacles will lead to increased variability of the product  The
next one is pricing related obstacles  This refers to
situations in which pricing policies of the product lead to
increase in variability 
It includes lot sizes
based on quantity discounts and price fluctuations  For example,
if manufacturer provides discounts based on lot sizes,
then wholesalers would place larger lot sizes than actual
requirement to enjoy discounts  Similarly, when price discounts
chain coordination  In the first video we will focus on what is
are provided by manufacturer wholesalers and retailers will
do forward buying to utilize the discounts and after the discount
period orders will be significantly low  In general
sales down the supply chain that is at the retailer level will
have lesser variability than sales up the supply chain that
is at the manufacturer level  The last type of obstacles is
behavioral related  It refers to problems in learning within
management that causes increased variability  This happens when
each stage does not recognize its impact on another  Any stage
or stages are unable to identify the root cause of the problem 
supply chain coordination and what are the obstacles to supply
Sometimes, information may not have been shared by retailer
regarding local promotion which would have resulted in increased
order during that period and manufacturer would be unable to
trace the reason for the same  Different stages starts blaming
one another for fluctuations  Next is lack of trust in others
channel partners  So, even if some channel partner is sharing
some information, the others don't rely on it  And lastly,
the limited company perspective 
The supply chain coordination is inevitable in order to optimize
productivity and profitability  In the next video, we will
chain coordination 
discuss on bullwhip effect its causes and consequences  Thank
you 
We human beings are consumers of various products and
services in daily life like tea, bread, clothes, car, banking
and so on 
Have you ever thought of how such products and services
reaches? Well, there are a whole lot of activities behind this
consumption  The products and services are manufactured and
supply chain  I would be presenting this module in three
delivered to end consumers through a network of value
adding activities called supply chain 
Supply chain activities involve procurement, processing,
production, logistics, inventory management, warehousing and so
on and include many channel partners like suppliers,
manufacturers, distributors, retailers and consumers  There
arises the need for seamless integration of activities as
various parties work towards a common goal of providing the
customers with the right product at the right time and at the
right place  This supply chain needs to be demand driven from
video lessons  Before moving on to the first lesson let us see
end consumer  Today, integration has become increasingly complex
due to technological innovations, globalization,
outsourcing practices and greater varieties  Having
understood the importance and complexity of supply chain
'coordination' shall be the only solution to ensure success of
supply chain  Companies involved in the supply chain network can
uptime competitive advantage through the supply chain
coordination 
Companies or channel partners
in a supply chain are dependent on each other for information,
the learning objectives of this module  They are: To develop
material, and financial flows  Supply chain coordination occurs
when all stages take action together considering the
consequences of their actions on other stages  Supply chain
coordination aims at improving the overall performance and
total profitability of the supply chain by proper alignment
of the plans and objectives of the individual channel partners 
Such coordination would remove uncertainity and reduce
variability within the network  In the traditional setup,
channel partners were working as silos or islands where every
channel partner would try to maximize their individual
understanding of supply chain coordination, explain bullwhip
profits and not the total supply chain profits  Such isolated
approach would lead to conflict among channel partners 
Therefore, each partner has to decide considering the impact on
other partners 
Moving on to incentive based obstacles  It refers to
situations in which incentives provided two different channel
partners increases variability and reduces total supply chain
profits  This includes local optimization within stages and
sales force incentives  Local optimization means trying to
optimize one stage or function without any regard to the impact
effect along with its causes and consequences, and to describe
it does on the entire supply chain  For instance, if
transportation function decides to optimize by transporting only
full truck loads, then it would increase inventory and
inventory holding cost  Sales force incentives are generally
provided to increase sales but how to be dealt with care  There
are two broad categories of sales force incentives:
First one "sell in" approach
which means the units of products sold by manufacturer to
distributor or retailer and the second one is "sell out" approach
which means the units of products sold by retailer to end
ways to minimize bullwhip effect 
consumer  If sales force incentives are planned with sell in
approach then it would result in excessive selling within stages
and high fluctuating order quantities during the period of
incentives  The next one is information-processing
obstacles  This refers to a situation in which demand
information is distorted as it moves between various stages
resulting in increased variability  This is called as
bullwhip effect which we will further discuss in the next
video  Information Processing obstacles includes forecasting
based on orders and lack of information sharing among
At the end of the session,
stages  For instance, the manufacturer relies on the
wholesaler regarding order quantity without knowing the
actual demand at the customer end  Similarly, the wholesaler
relies on information from retailers without knowing the
actual customer demand  So, when the manufacturer or wholesaler
does prediction with such received demand data then actual
demand data, then variability increases up the supply chain 
Similarly, if a retailer like D-mart is offering some
promotions to increase sales and if the same information is not
shared among the channel partners then it would result
learners will be able to appreciate the need for supply
in increased variations  Now moving on to operational
obstacles  It refers to actions taken in the course of placing
and filling orders that leads to increased variability  This
includes ordering in larger lots, large replenishment lead-
time, and rationing and shortage gaming  Retailers or wholesalers
prefer to order in larger lots to take advantage of discounts
but it may significantly increase variability if there is
a higher difference between demand fluctuations and order
fluctuations  Large replenishment lead-time is also
an obstacle for supply chain coordination  For instance, if
chain coordination, comprehend the causes and consequences of
This might result in increased variability and uncertainty 
The next one be rationing and shortage gaming  When there is shortage of products,
the suppliers will ration the product
to the downstream channel partners 
Therefore, downstream channel partners
place excess demand order so that they can meet their actual needs
after rationing  This leads to sharing of
inflated demand than actual demand for the product between the channel members 
So, these are the reasons for happening of bullwhip effect 
Now let us move on to the consequences of bullwhip effect
one of the world's best producer of household products
on performance in the supply chain 
If you look at the various performance measures
such as manufacturing cost
it increases because of bullwhip effect, inventory cost increases,
transportation cost again increases,
replenishment lead-time increases due to bullwhip effect,
labour cost also increases, whereas,
profitability, product availability decreases due to bullwhip effect,
and finally looking at the shipping and receiving costs
it also increases due to bullwhip effect 
faced the problem of extreme demand variations
Music
It is clearly evident that information distortion
across the supply chain causes bullwhip effect 
This arises due to inefficient forecasting,
poor communication, larger orders, price fluctuations,
free return policies and rationing and shortage gaming 
The bullwhip effect increases cost to the company reduces product availability
increases lead time and reduces the total
profitability of the supply chain 
Dear learners! Having understood what bullwhip effect
for one of its best selling brands pampers diapers 
and the consequences of it,
let us learn about the ways and means of minimizing
the bullwhip effect in the next video 
Thank you 
The logistics executives at Procter & Gamble examined
the order rates for pampers across the supply chain 
To they are surprise they found that the infant birth rate and
baby diaper usage has remained stable
but there were variations noticed in the orders placed 
The purchase rate was found to be more or less steady at the consumer end
but the logistics executives on further investigation found that
Dear learners from the previous video,
the variation in orders increased from the retailer level
to the distributor level and further up the supply chain 
Procter & Gamble termed this lack of coordination as the "Bullwhip effect" 
Music
It refers to the situation in which fluctuations in order
increases from the retailers to wholesalers to manufacturers to suppliers 
This can also be referred as "Forrester effect",
named after the founder, Jay Forrester, in 1961 
It is named by the wave the amplitude of a whip increases along its length 
Imagine a person holding a whip in his hand
you would have understood that conflict among supply chain partners
and then that person moves their wrist a bit it causes amplified
wave pattern in a chain reaction  Bullwhip effect arises
because demand for goods is based on
forecasting than the actual consumer demand 
Also, every channel partner would like to avoid stock out position
and therefore, escalates the actual demand 
The bullwhip effect distorts demand information
within the supply chain  Each channel partner
would have a different estimate of the demand 
This would lead to lack of supply chain coordination among
and distortion in information causes damage to coordination 
different channel partners  Let us discuss the same
with the hypothetical example 
Consider actual demand from customers
for a product to be eight units 
Now retailer places order for
10 units from the distributor in order to ensure sufficient stock 
So, what the retailer has done is he has placed 2 units
excess than actual demand 
Next distributor orders 20 units from the manufacturer
placing bulk orders so that future demand
Supply_chain_Management_5446
from the retailers can be met 
So the distributor has placed
12 units in excess of the actual demand 
Now manufacturer orders 40 units
from the supplier to take advantage of economies of scale,
which is 32 units excess than actual demand 
40 units are manufactured for the actual demand of 8 units 
The excess goods produced will be stored which requires
excess inventory space and it also increases inventory carry cost
or the excess goods have to be sold at a discount 
In this video we will discuss: The significance of coordination 
Music
This is generally forecast demand as customer demand
is rapidly stable and in doing so,
they rely on a lot of information
from the channel members in the supply chain 
The channel members down the supply chain do not share
reliable information to the upstream partners for various reasons
which finally end up in bullwhip effect 
Let us move on to the reasons  Number one be disorganisation 
The stages in the supply chain function as independent units
What exactly is bullwhip effect? Its causes and consequences 
and therefore they either over or under react
to orders from the downstream supply chain 
The next one is lack of communication 
As there is lack of information flow between the stages, each stage perceives
the demand order according to their perceptions and experience
and therefore each stage has a different demand picture in front of them 
Free return policy  Consumers may intentionally
overstate the demand for the product due to
cancellation and free return policies which might end up in
retailer ordering excess quantities than needed 
Before moving further to "Bullwhip effect" 
The next one is order batching  Instead of small orders,
companies tries to accumulate various orders and then place larger orders 
They do so inorder to minimize ordering cost
and to take advantage of bulk buying 
This might lead to high demand
in some period followed by no or limited demand at times 
The next reason be price variations 
Buyers would exhibit different buying patterns
when prices of products are not stable 
Channel members might introduce discounts which would alter
Let us understand the origination of the term in the industrial setup 
the routine buying patterns 
Buyers engage in forward buying
to enjoy the discounts or sometimes even postpone purchases
in anticipation of some price cuts in future 
This would lead to severe demand fluctuations and uneven production 
The other reason would be relying on past demand 
That is, sometimes channel partners rely on
demand information of previous years to forecast
the demand for the current period without considering
any fluctuations for that period 
In the early 1990s Procter & Gamble,
Customers would be frustrated
if they had to wait for the product 
Therefore, material and information delays
have to be reduced or eliminated 
This would be possible by practicing
lean supply chain systems
which would eliminate unnecessary processes 
Also, the number of tiers in the supply chain
could be reduced in order to improve efficiency 
Music
a fully integrated solution would result in optimal results 
Coordination has become vital to improve
supply chain profitability
as it encompasses a complex structure 
Conflict among channel partners and smooth flow of information
are the biggest challenges
for ensuring supply chain coordination 
It is obvious that bullwhip effect
cannot be eliminated completely
but companies might minimize the bullwhip effect
using coordination mechanisms such as information sharing,
It is not always practiced by the independent organizations 
stable prices, contracts, smaller order batches,
joint decision making and with advanced (IT) tools 
Thank you! Dear learners 
Each channel member usually prefers to optimize their individual objectives
rather than working on total supply chain performance and profitability 
Such an attitude could hamper the growth of the supply chain in the long run 
Therefore, it is important to introduce
necessary coordination mechanisms in order to overcome
supply chain inefficiencies and to achieve overall supply chain profitability 
Music
Let us now move on to various coordination mechanisms
Dear learners, in the previous videos
that are available to minimize bullwhip effect in the supply chain 
Let us discuss them one after the other 
The first one being information sharing 
Each stage is managed by different entities 
Therefore, information such as inventory data,
end consumer data, sales data, production schedule,
capacity, quality, and lead-time shall be shared
online or offline to ensure coordination 
The end customer demand information needs to be shared
with the upstream members in the supply chain 
we had discussed about supply chain coordination,
Walmart, for instance, shares the point of sales data
with its major suppliers like (Procter & Gamble)
so that exact demand is shared with supply chain partners 
This would help the upstream members
to work with actual data instead of indirect demand data,
but still there may be differences in forecast
due to the various methods and techniques employed for forecasting 
Also there are advanced initiatives like, vendor managed inventory,
quick response that is (QR), then efficient customer response,
collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment
its obstacles, bullwhip effect, its causes and consequences 
techniques in order to assist
smooth information flow between the channel partners 
The next strategy available is joint decision making 
In this approach, various supply chain members
jointly plan and decide on forecasting,
product design, replenishment, incentive schemes,
profit sharing, ordering, scheduling, and advertising 
Raw data of actual sales captured using
(POS) shall be used for single forecasting
and may be shared across various stages 
In this video, we will discuss the various mechanisms
Here, channel partners shall avoid
repetitive processing of demand data 
The next coordination mechanism is price stability 
It is necessary to adapt price stability to ensure coordination 
Decisions such as everyday low pricing
to be adapted instead of promotional pricing,
so that bullwhip effect would be minimized 
Such pricing policy would encourage
stable buying behavior among buyers 
It will also enable buyers
available to achieve coordination in supply chain 
to refrain from forward buying or postponement of purchases
in anticipation of price discounts or promotions 
Walmart has been very successful with the (EDLP) strategy 
Another way to ensure price stability is to provide
discounts based on volume and not on lot sizes 
The next coordination mechanism is supply chain contracts 
Several different contract types
such as buyback, revenue sharing,
quantity flexibility, sales rebates,
service territories, and quantity discount contracts are available
Music
to improve coordination among the channel partners 
Such contract improves loyalty and relationship among the channel partners 
Toyota entered into long term contracts
with its suppliers to gain trust and confidence 
Another mechanism would be
the use of (IT) tools 
Internet, RFID, EDI, POS, ERP systems
are few (IT) tools that facilitate
coordination in the supply chain 
These tools enable visibility to all channel members
In general the various organizations
and therefore, increases responsiveness 
Dell's direct sell model has been successful
with its online order capturing system 
Haier's major success is through
online supply chain activities 
The next coordination mechanism being smaller order batches 
Large order batches
increases fluctuations and contribute to bullwhip effect 
Therefore, small order batches to be encouraged
by the upstream supply chain partners 
in the supply chain are independent parties
Necessary action to be taken to reduce fixed cost
associated with ordering, transporting, and receiving each lot 
This can be made possible
by having transportation aggregation
with third party logistics, providers,
and by reducing order processing cost
through automation and (ERP) systems 
Web-based ordering also can be used for smaller orders 
The last mechanism of i level to reduce bullwhip effect
would be reducing the delays 
though it is an established fact that
Supply_chain_Management_5625
shipping and delivery cost 
Besides cost-per-touch IKEA follows
the max /min replenishment system
for its product reordering 
For all the products two factors are set:
The minimum amount of products available before reordering
and the maximum amount of a product to order at one time 
At IKEA the max,min levels are usually set by the stock needed for one day 
All IKEA locations have an in-store logistics manager 
The in house logistics managers collect
understand means of achieving sustainability in supply chain 
the point of sale data regarding sales
using the central inventory management software 
The inventory system at IKEA also notifies deviations if any 
IKEA further uses separate high flow
and low flow warehouse facilities very efficiently 
In high flow warehouses  High demand products are stocked
and the storage and retrieval processes are highly automated
in high flow warehouses  Low flow warehouse facilities,
products that have low demand are stocked in low flow warehouses 
where the processes are manual 
In this video we will discuss supply chain sustainability,
These sustainability strategies
have given competitive advantage for the
retailer IKEA and it is highly successful
with low operating cost and high product demand 
To conclude, we have discussed
what supply chain sustainability is all about?
along with its significance 
The factors affecting sustainability of the supply chain 
In the next lesson, we will discuss on the framework
for evaluating sustainability in supply chain 
its significance, factors affecting sustainable supply chains,
Thank you 
along with the case lead 
Well, dear learners I'm Sure, all of you are aware
of what a supply chain is?
Let's consider a bottle of pepsi that we consume 
How does that reach us? There are a lot of activities
in the whole process such as procurement of raw materials,
such as sparkling water, cane sugar, caramel,
Warm greetings to all  In this session,
apple extracts, natural plant extracts and so on 
Then processing the same in manufacturing unit, storage,
transporting and distribution of the same to end consumers 
All these activities involved in moving the raw material
to the end consumers as finished goods are termed as supply chain 
We know that all these activities consume a lot of natural resources
such as energy, raw materials and alike, which are limited 
Further each process gives out a lot of waste
in the process such as carbon emissions, solid, and liquid waste 
Here comes the need for sustainability 
I would like to discuss about sustainability in supply chain 
In organization which connects the suppliers
and end consumers does not exist on its own 
It's a part of the whole world and is bound to be responsible to society 
An organization takes a lot of inputs
from nature and society and delivers output back to the society 
Therefore,the organization has to be responsible for designing and implementing
what is called a sustainable supply chain?
Having seen the significance  Let us now see what exactly is
supply chain sustainability?
Well, supply chain sustainability
The learning objectives: To understand
is a holistic view of supply chain processes
and activities that addresses the environment,
social, economic, and legal aspects thoroughly 
Today,organizations not only strive towards profitability
but also they struggle to meet sustainability norms 
Therefore, sustainability in the supply chain is more a strategic approach
which has to align with an organization's goals, planning, and implementation 
A sustainable supply chain
demonstrates a long- term commitment
to the procurement and supply chain management
the importance of sustainability in supply chain,
that considers: The environmental,
social and economic consequences of design,
non-renewable material use, manufacture and production methods,
logistics, service delivery use, operation,
maintenance, reuse, recycling options, disposal,
and suppliers capabilities to address
these consequences throughout the supply chain 
This definition has been given by the Department for Environment
Food and Rural affairs 2006 
The major driving forces towards supply chain sustainability are: Number one:
describe the framework for evaluating sustainability,
Improving profits and to reduce risk,
number two, government mandates and community pressures
and finally attracting new generation customers
who value sustainability 
Now let's move on to the factors affecting supply chain sustainability 
They are: Waste from various processes,
carbon footprint and emissions,
air pollutants, water pollution, safety violations,
deforestation, non degradable packaging, and labour law violations 
Having seen the meaning of supply chain sustainability 
and to discuss ways and means of enhancing sustainability in the supply chain 
Let us discuss a real case example of a company
that has moved way ahead in its sustainability efforts 
IKEA is one of the world's largest home furnishing retailer
with more than 411 locations across 49 countries
and it has sincerely committed to planet and people 
Following are some of the sustainability initiatives at IKEA 
IKEA products, including packaging are made from renewable
or recycled products 
IKEA uses few materials for making the products
without any compromise on quality or durability thereby saving cost 
At the end of the session the learners would be able to
IKEA has introduced a code of conduct
for its suppliers, namely IWAY, that is IKEA way of purchasing
home furnishing products which has accounted for
positive impact on environment way beyond compliance 
IKEA almost produces 1/3rd of their total energy consumption
through renewable energy sources
such as solar power, energy from wind mills and bio-mass 
IKEA strictly restricts child labour in its supply chain 
It has also banned PVC in their products and lead from mirrors 
IKEA has moved from incandescent bulbs to energy efficient LED bulbs
appreciate the need for sustainability in supply chain,
in all their stores  IKEA sources raw materials
such as wood and cotton from certified sustainable sources 
IKEA, collects point of sale data regarding sales, ideas, and smart solutions 
IKEA has reduced transportation related carbon emissions
significantly by switching to electric vehicles 
IKEA uses cost-per-touch inventory approach
which means the more hands that touch a product in the supply chain
the higher will be the cost 
Customers select their items,
pick them into warehouse and go home  Thus, IKEA saves on
comprehend the dimensions of sustainability in the supply chain,
Dear learners! In this video we will discuss on various methods
stages in the supply chain, to identify inefficiencies,
automate decision making, and improve customer's buying experiences 
To conclude, sustainable supply chain provides enormous benefits
to the organization such as increased profitability,
reduced operating costs, new product and process innovation,
optimal use of natural resources, retention of human talents,
increased reputation, greater engagement with local communities,
and above all, creating a safer planet to live 
Achieving sustainability in the supply chain cannot happen overnight 
It needs strategic thinking, planning, and execution
Though initially sustainability solutions
with the cooperation of all stakeholders 
Companies therefore, could take proactive steps
towards its sustainability initiatives 
No doubts, such initiatives
would add cost initially, but for sure, the companies would fetch
significant returns in the long run 
Sustainable supply chains are the only solution for
cleaner, safer earth 
Thank you  Happy learning!
may involve some upfront cost, it would bring in
reasonable gains in the long term 
It is necessary for companies to understand
the impact of their supply chain on people and environment 
Negative social and environmental impact
would lead to legal risk, financial loss, and damage of reputation 
Once the companies understand their sustainability impacts,
it needs to identify suppliers, understand the
environmental and social challenges faced by suppliers
by which we can ensure sustainability in the supply chain 
and then prioritize them  Manufacturers need to prioritize
suppliers based on their sustainability reports and performance 
Further, suppliers who score well on sustainability
could be provided suitable incentives by the manufacturers
so that they remain motivated  The next would be to set goals
and communicate to all stakeholders 
It is better to have sustainability goals
in their mission and vision so that
the significance is better communicated 
Manufacturers need to communicate their sustainability efforts
We are living in an era of global warming, depletion, and
throughout the supply chain right from suppliers to end consumers 
For the manufacturers can establish necessary code of
conduct for suppliers, wholesalers, distributors and
retailers and monitor the sell  For instance, Walmart aspires to
be a packaging neutral company by 2025 
Walmart has convinced its suppliers
such as (Procter & Gamble), (Johnson & Johnson) and
(Unilever) to find greener sources for their products 
The next is ethical sourcing practices:
Manufacturers need to be vigilant on their target suppliers 
exploitation of natural resources 
They need to monitor the extraction
and production of raw materials by the suppliers 
Further, they need to monitor closely if the suppliers
confirm to the sustainability standards and code of conduct
set by them 
Annual audits could also be done to measure
the performance of suppliers 
The next one is to identify and reduce waste 
Manufacturers need to identify and reduce waste in any form
such as inventory waste, process, production,
Life on earth would become highly challenging
administrative, distribution related waste and they have to
work on improving the same 
Supply chain processes need to be simplified
and continuous monitoring and feedback system
would help in reducing the waste 
For instance, the world's largest
footwear and sports apparel manufacturer Nike with more than
700 factories across 42 countries practices, zero waste approach 
They work towards circular future where
everything is reused and nothing is wasted 
if manufacturers do not incorporate
Nike has significantly reduced
its carbon emissions by adapting innovative
and modernization in its processes 
And by using less recycled materials,
less water for manufacturing, and all of
these things have contributed in achieving supply chain success 
The next approach would be training and capacity building programs 
Suppliers need to be trained in sustainability
practices and its benefits  Manufacturers could organize
training and capacity building programs for their suppliers and
sustainability in their supply chains 
transfer best practices and case studies 
Vendor conferences, workshops, online training modules,
to be conducted on regular basis
so that suppliers could develop their competencies 
Industry collaborations: Manufacturers need to partner
and collaborate with other sustainable businesses in order
to stay competitive 
This would enable them to share best practices
and to implement reforms in their supply chain 
For instance, it would help in combined transportation, thereby
Today, government is also
saving money 
The next one is optimal use of technology and data 
Supply chains are complex network of people with higher
dependence on each other 
Digital platforms assist manufacturing companies
to track the sustainability progress of their suppliers through
monitoring, surveys, and audits 
For instance, (Unilever) ensures sustainable sourcing through
technology as it collects data from the farmers in their supply chain
with the help of a software 
insisting on sustainability by businesses with its laws,
Further, technology based advancements in supply chain
can be witnessed by way of
data-driven transportation management systems,
intelligent routing software, autonomous trucks, automated warehousing,
and much more 
Supply chain also generates lot of data 
Technologies such as internet of things, machine learning,
artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing,
blockchain, and satellite technology uses enormous data
and information to track the product movement across the
rules, and regulations 
Dear learners! In this video, we will discuss
with rupees 11,200 crores of profit after tax in the financial year 2018,
and has also achieved other standards
in accordance with global reporting initiative 
ITC has been carbon-positive for 13 consecutive years,
water-positive for 16 consecutive years,
and solid waste recycling positive for the past 11 years 
It has set up 23 platinum-certified
green buildings and has created 6 million livelihood opportunities 
The company does intensive watershed development
and large scale afforestation  ITC has also reduced
or assessed not by their profit alone
energy and water consumption significantly thereby it has achieved
triple bottom line success in a larger way 
To conclude, the triple bottom line approach
focuses on profit, people,
and planet and this approach
has significantly changed the way businesses
assess their performance  TBL needs long-term commitment
and innovation by the organizations 
The measurement of people and profit dimension
poses a big challenge to organizations adopting TBL 
but also by their sustainability solutions 
However, the framework is quite flexible
to incorporate the specific needs of the organizations 
Therefore, the TBL framework amidst its challenges,
enables organizations to have sustainable growth in the long run 
In the next video, we will discuss about
ways and means of enhancing sustainability in organizations 
Thank you 
Two other bottom lines, namely,
societal and environmental impacts have been brought in
to assess the performance of companies along with profits 
The triple bottom line method measures the organization
in terms of social, environment, and economic sustainability 
The phrase, people, planet, and profit best describes
the triple bottom line and the goal of sustainability 
The term triple bottom line was first coined by John Elkington in 1994,
how sustainability initiatives of the organizations can be measured and reported 
and reported further in his book Cannibals with Forks,
the triple bottom line of 21st century business in 1999 
Today, many non-profit, profit, and government sectors
have started using triple bottom line to assess their performance 
The concept of (TBL) as it is defined seems
easier to understand, but it is tough to practice
because measuring the dimensions of people
and the planet is quite difficult 
Profit could be measured in terms of rupee or dollar value
but how could social health or environmental health
All of us are aware that traditionally
of organizations be measured 
Global reporting initiative (GRI) has developed
guidelines to enable businesses
to report and measure their social environment and economic impact 
Let us now, further discuss the three dimensions of TBL 
Number one social dimension 
The social or the people bottom line addresses the interaction
with human capital by organizations 
According to the social bottom line,
the businesses need to consider the interest
businesses were judged by the financial profits they make 
and well being of all people connected with them 
People can include, the raw material suppliers,
labour, top management, and other stakeholders 
Companies with societal interest
try to give back to the community also 
Following are some examples
of how businesses could score on social sustainability,
not employing child labour, providing
a safe work environment for workers,
adopting fair hiring policies,
In traditional accounting, they used to describe profit or loss
provision of adequate health care to staff,
ensuring fair salaries to workers,
providing opportunities for training and development,
and not practicing any form of human trafficking
would enhance the social score of businesses 
However, it is quite difficult to measure this dimension
as it is more subjective in nature 
The (GRI) has developed guidelines
in order to enable businesses to report
and measure their social impact 
of the businesses as the bottom line as it used to appear
The second one is environmental sustainability 
The environment or planet bottom line
refers to the natural capital
and the sustainable environmental practices followed by the organizations 
Environment sustainability refers to managing,
monitoring, and reporting the consumption of resources,
waste, and emissions  Companies focusing on this aspect
recognize the need for 'Going Green'
which would provide them with profitability in the long run 
Following are a few planet- friendly practices,
at the end of the profit and loss account 
using renewable energy, recycling of waste materials,
reuse of materials, safe disposal of toxic materials,
reduced carbon and other hazardous gas emission,
and limited use of water and other natural resources 
The last dimension of TBL is economic sustainability 
The economic or profit bottom line deals with
the economic value created by the organization
after deducting the cost of all inputs 
It is not the 'profit' as per traditional accounting
rather, it is the real economic impact
And only one bottom line, that is profits was considered
created by the organization on its economic environment 
Following are few sustainable economic practices:
Helping local suppliers stay in businesses,
focus on overall supply chain profitability,
fair payment to employees,
the right choice of input materials 
Having seen, the three dimensions of TBL 
Let us also discuss the benefits of TBL 
This approach ensures transparency and accountability of the organization 
It builds reputation among consumers and the general public 
to be the driving force for any businesses 
TBL, enhances productivity and reduces operating costs 
It provides competitive advantage to the organization 
It enables to retain the best talented workforce
and provides avenues for new markets 
It further helps in increasing market share
and encourages corporate social
responsibility reporting  Having seen the benefits,
let us discuss a real case example
that has used TBL approach 
The multi-business player ITC delivers a triple-bottom-line
But due to legal and government pressures, organizations today
leading to a forecast error which may cause the Bull whip effect 
This may have an impact or effect on the demand of the supply chain 
Hence, the demand for a product is based
on the influence of several factors like
past data, lead time, promotions, economic conditions,
pricing policy, competition, supply situation and their interrelationship 
Knowledge about the market and environment
will help the supply chain manager in making a good forecasting decision 
Forecast has two components,
systematic component and a random component 
Let us have an introduction to supply chain 
A systematic component measures the expected demand
and uses the trend and seasonality of the demand in forecasting 
Whereas, a random component
measures the fluctuations in demand
from the expected value of demand by analyzing the uncontrollable factors
and estimating the forecasting error
which is a very important input
to the supply chain managers in forecasting demand 
In this episode, we have discussed
the role of forecasting in supply chain
The supply chain involves in moving around materials
and understood the characteristic of forecasting 
In the next episode, we will discuss the different forecasting methods 
Thank you 
Music
from the supplier point to the customer point through the intermediaries
in a cost-effective manner to satisfy the customer 
In this process we can visualize information flow, fund flow,
material flow, across the supply chain in both directions 
The primary objective of the supply chain
is to satisfy the customer needs and generate profit 
Supply chain management is the set of activities
involved in efficiently integrating the suppliers,
Demand forecasting in a supply chain 
manufacturers, warehouses, and stores 
So that the products which are produced
are distributed at the right quantities,
to the right locations, at the right time 
In order to minimize the system wide costs
while satisfying the service level requirements
of each member in the supply chain to meet the customer expectations 
Having known what supply chain is about,
let us look into the role of forecasting in supply chain 
A good and accurate forecast will determine
The learning objectives are: To discuss the significance of demand
how much inventory a company can keep
at various supply and demand points along its supply chain 
It helps in making decisions on the quantity
and time of continuous replenishment 
Sharing of updated information continuously across the supply chain
improves the demand planning process of the supply chain 
A good forecast reduces the level of inventory maintained
with the manufacturer and typically follows
vendor management inventory system
and reduces the cost of the supply chain 
and supply planning in a supply chain,
This helps the company to follow 'JUST IN TIME INVENTORY' 
An accurate forecast helps in planning
the lead time appropriately
and delivers the product on time to the customer 
Let us take an example of a supply chain
of the retail giant Reliance Mart 
When you look into the supply chain of Reliance Mart,
we can understand that the demand from the customer
and is captured by the retail outlet
and shared with the distribution center or the central warehouse 
to understand the decisions to be taken during the demand planning process,
Then the central warehouse translates this demand
to the downstream members of the supply chain towards the suppliers 
This helps the members of the supply chain
to plan their manufacturing and supply
according to the requirement of the customers at the right time 
The decisions of the members of this supply chain
are based on the demand of the customer 
The demand for certain products are high
whereas the customer pulls the product from the system 
When the demand for the product is low,
third, to discuss the tools which are used in demand planning 
the products are push from the system to the customer 
Whether it is a Pull product or a push product
the supply chain has to estimate the demand for the products
which is important for the supply chain manager 
A supply chain manager can estimate the future forecast based on the past data 
With the past data he can predict/estimate the future demand,
which is known as the forecast of demand 
When the demand is stable,
forecasting the demand becomes easy,
whereas if the demand is not stable
The learning outcomes: To understand the importance of demand
then a good forecast is needed
for the efficient demand planning of the supply chain 
Having understood what is the role of forecast in supply chain 
Let us look at the characteristics of a forecast 
The characteristics or forecast can be one
the demand uncertainty, which we call it as the forecast error
which is the key input to the supply chain decisions 
Take the example of Reliance Mart 
The store manager forecast the demand for a product
based on the past data and with his experience in the store 
and supply planning in a supply chain,
But that forecast may not be accurate
as there may be many uncontrollable factors
affecting the demand leading to a forecasting error 
This is an important characteristic of forecast
which may affect the supply chain decision 
Second, the long term forecast is less accurate
when compare to the short term forecast which is more accurate 
In Reliance Mart, weekly forecast of demand will be more accurate
than a monthly forecast of demand,
which may help in improving the efficiency of the supply chain 
to understand the decisions to be taken during demand planning process,
Third characteristic, aggregate forecast
is more accurate than the disaggregate forecast for a supply chain 
For example, in the supply chain of Reliance Mart,
if the forecast of the retail outlet is shared with the
upstream members and downstream members to make a total forecast by them,
it will be more accurate than an independent forecast of each member 
Four characteristics, longer the supply chain of a company
greater the distortion of information resulting in forecast error 
Example, the Reliance Mart supply chain, if the supply chain is longer
there is always a chance of distortion of information
third, the knowledge on the tools used in demand planning 
Music
Whereas long-range forecast will encompass a period of time
which is longer than two years 
Demand behavior can be categorized as a trend,
random variation, cyclical and seasonal pattern 
The trend behavior is defined as a gradual,
long-term up or down movement of demand 
Random variations are defined as the movement in demand
that do not follow a specific pattern 
Cyclic behaviour is defined as an
up-and-down repetitive movement in demand 
In the last episode we have discussed
Seasonal pattern of behavior is defined as an up-and-down
repetitive movement of demand occurring periodically 
Forecasting methods can be categorized into
qualitative and quantitative methods 
Qualitative forecast methods are subjective in nature 
They use judgment, intuition, expertise opinion to produce
quantitative estimates of the future demand 
When historical data is not available
this method is used to estimate the future demand 
Experts who have good market knowledge
the role of forecasting in supply chain and its characteristics 
intelligence make such decisions 
Quantitative forecast methods are objective in nature
and are based on numerical data and application of mathematical formulas 
They are classified as
time series analysis, casual analysis and simulation analysis 
Let us look into the time series analysis 
When historical data are available,
we use time series analysis
to estimate the demand for a short term period six months,
which will be accurate 
In this episode we will discuss about the different forecasting methods 
Time series is a statistical technique that uses
historical demand data to predict future demand 
Time Series assumes that the environment and factors of consideration
which has occurred in the past
will continue to remain the same in the future too 
It relates the forecast to only one factor that is time 
This method is widely used
since it is simple and easy to forecast the demand 
Linear trend line method moving average method exponential smoothing
or few time series analysis methods which are used in forecasting 
The different types of forecasting methods
Linear trend is a technique which fits a linear trend line
using a mathematical equation involving the independent variable
and the dependent variable with constants 
A moving average is an indicator that shows
the average value over a period of time 
Simple moving averages apply
equal weight to the data over a period of time 
Exponential smoothing is a moving average method
which applies more weight to recent data
over the time period of forecast to forecast the demand 
depend on the time frame, demand behavior and causes of behavior 
Casual Analysis: A casual method of forecasting
uses the relationship between the various demand
factors of supply chain and their relationship to estimate the demand for the future 
This method would be a good forecasting method
for a medium to long term period 
This method is prone to substantial forecasting error 
Correlation and regression methods are used to estimate
the future demand under this method 
Correlation is a measure of the strength of the relationship between
independent and dependent variable 
Time frame indicates how far into the future is the forecast
Whereas, regression method is an attempt
to develop a mathematical relationship
between demand and factors that cause its behavior 
Linear regression is a mathematical technique
that relates a dependent variable
to an independent variable in the form of a linear equation 
Simulation Analysis: This method imitates the situation
and predicts the demand for the future 
Algorithms are formulated to estimate the future demand 
Another important characteristics of forecasting is the forecasting error,
which can be short range, medium range and long range based on it 
which we have discussed earlier 
When the future forecast is not
perfectly estimated based on past data,
the future forecast will have an error to some degree 
The error in the forecast is referred to as forecast error
which is the difference between the forecast and the actual 
Mathematically forecast error is given by <eqn>Et is equal to Ft minus
Dt, where Et is the forecast error in period t </eqn>
Ft is the forecasted demand in period t
and Dt is the actual demand in period t 
Short or mid-range forecast typically encompasses
By using this, we calculate or estimate
the forecast error and apply the same in forecasting the demand 
In this episode, we have discussed the different types of forecasting methods 
In the next step, we will discuss the steps involved in forecasting 
Thank you 
the immediate future, which may be from daily up to two years time period 
the second step is to collect the data and analyze 
Collecting historical data on the demand, supply, lead time,
pricing, inventory, competitive product, competitors share in the market,
and economic environment will help the supply chain manager
to use an analyze the data for appropriate forecast 
Third step, is to identify the appropriate forecasting method to be used 
The supply chain manager should understand the dimensions
that are relevant to the forecast
which may have an impact on the demand of the product 
Based on the dimensions to be analyzed an appropriate
In the last two episodes, we have discussed
forecasting method has to be selected
from the methods discussed earlier 
It may be quantitative or qualitative methods 
The next step is to compute the forecast 
A supply chain manager should use the data available
and compute the forecast for the dimensions
chosen using the appropriate forecast method 
After computing the forecast,
we have to check for the forecast accuracy 
Once the forecast is made, the supply chain manager
the role of forecasting in supply chain and the different forecasting methods 
has to check for the impact of forecast error on the forecast accuracy 
If suitable adjustments have to be made
based on the forecast error
the adjustments needed are done to have a good forecast 
Music
Forecast for the planning horizon 
Once the forecast adjustment is done,
then the forecast is done for the total planning horizon,
so that the forecast for the demand of the product is done 
Based on the results,
In this episode, we will discuss about the steps in forecasting 
the supply chain manager monitors the results
and its accuracy to improve the efficiency of the supply chain 
Next, we discuss the risk management in forecasting 
Error in forecasting may have significant impact on the supply chain
at the planning stage and the operational stage 
At the planning stage, plans are prepared based on the forecasting
relating to the sourcing decisions,
inventory to be stored, products to be produced,
transportation requirement based on the numbers and the pricing strategy 
At the operational stage,
The first step in forecasting is to identify the need of forecast 
the day to day activities depend on the accurate forecast
as this may affect the members of the supply chain 
Hence, an accurate forecast will lead to
effective functioning of the supply chain 
The forecast error is a risk in demand planning 
Longer lead times, seasonality of the products,
shorter life cycle of the product,
catering to a niche market, etc, are the factors leading to the forecast error
creating the risk in demand planning 
To manage the risks two strategies can be adopted by the supply chain manager,
In a supply chain, there are number of channel members,
namely increased responsiveness of the supply chain and pooling of demand 
Increased responsiveness means
the supply chain is needed to invest in creating additional capacity
in meeting the demand faster to reduce the forecasting errors
and the risks associated with it 
Pooling of demand helps the supply chain to smoothen the fluctuating demand
arising from multiple sources
in avoiding the forecasting error and the risks associated with it 
Implementing of these two strategies would add to the cost of the supply chain 
Hence, the supply chain manager has to understand the market thoroughly
every member of the channel has a need on the forecasting information 
and use these strategies to offset the forecast errors
and the risks leading to an improved supply chain 
IT plays a very important role in forecasting 
The role of (IT) can be discuss further 
Forecasting software is important in a supply chain 
Each company uses different algorithms in the demand planning module 
A good algorithm always helps the supply chain
to forecast the demand accurately and share information across the supply chain 
The software also supports what if analysis
to support planning to take care of and toward eventualities 
It becomes important to understand the requirement
Summary
we have discussed the significance of forecasting in supply chain
and the tools which are used in forecasting the demand 
We understand that collaboration among the members of the supply chain
in building a forecast will give more accurate
forecast of demand across the supply chain 
The process may take time in making the partners in the supply chain
to understand and work together 
But the outcome of such collaborations is always fruitful 
A good forecast will help the supply chain manager
of the members of the supply chain and share it to them 
to plan the demand and supply effectively
to achieve the efficiency of the supply chain 
In this module, we have discussed the various steps involved in forecasting 
We will come again with another module on supply chain 
Thank you

Once we share the information,
Aggregate planning in a supply chain  The learning objectives of
in aggregate planning and the methods of solving an aggregate
planning problem  Let us have an introduction to supply chain 
Supply chain involves in moving materials from the supplier
point to the customer point to the intermediaries in a cost
effective manner to satisfy the customer  In this process, we
can visualize information flow, fund flow, and material flow
across the supply chain in both directions  The primary
objective of the supply chain is to satisfy the customer needs
and generate profit  A Supply chain management is the set of
activities involved in efficiently integrating the
this module are: To understand the concept of aggregate
suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses and stores  So that
the products which are produced are distributed at the right
quantities to the right location and at the right time, in order
to minimize the system wide costs while satisfying the
service level requirements of each member in the supply chain
to meet the customer expectations  Let us now
understand what aggregate planning is? Aggregate planning
is the process of planning the quantity and timing of output
over an intermediate time horizon say 6 to 12
months period in a manufacturing plant  It involves adjusting the
planning, to analyze the role of aggregate planning in supply
controllable variables to respond to forecast and order
fluctuations in a rational manner  What should be the
capacity of a plant to meet the fluctuating demand? Should the
company decide the capacity based on this demand or plan
for average demand and satisfy the demand using other resources
like subcontracting or inventory holding  These questions arise to
a manufacturing plant  Holding inventory during less demand
period and using the accumulated stock during the peak period
demand will be an option  Allowing stock out and making the
customer to wait till the next period and then satisfying his
chain, to understand the information needed for aggregate
demand may be another option  Aggregate planning analyzes this
situation and determines the quantity required in terms of
capacity of the plant, production, subcontracting,
inventory and stock outs in meeting the demand of the supply
chain  The basic objective of the aggregate planning is to
satisfy the demand at the lowest cost and maximize the profit of
the manufacturing company  Let us now discuss on the role of
aggregate planning in supply chain  Aggregate planning is the
planning process followed in a manufacturing company in a
supply chain to satisfy the fluctuating demand  The company
planning process, to learn the various strategies in aggregate
uses the controllable variables of production process, capacity,
workforce, inventory, subcontracting, back ordering to
cater to the demand  Since the process of aggregate planning is
associated with manufacturing plant, will this impact the
supply chain? Yes, it will have an impact on the supply chain  The
downstream and upstream partners of the supply chain are going to
have an impact because of the collaborative forecast where
they do in determining the demand for the supply chain to
increase its efficiency  The demand of the downstream members
of the supply chain determines the forecast of the production
planning, to understand the different methods of aggregate
plan  The production plan of a manufacturing company will
define the demand of this supplier of the supply chain 
Hence, the aggregate plan of a manufacturing company in the
supply chain impacts the entire supply chain processes 
The controllable variables which are used in aggregate planning
are: Capacity, workforce, time, inventory, subcontracting, back
ordering  The aggregate plan is prepared using the various
variables allowing the supply chain to alter the capacity
allocation, supply contracts, inventory stocked, inventory moved,
labor employed etc, to satisfy the demand of the supply chain 
planning process, to formulate and solve a basic aggregate
This plan which is done by the manufacturer should be shared
with the members of the supply chain  Suppliers, transporters
warehouse and the retailers to incorporate the changes needed
in their plans, which will optimize the supply chain
performance  Hence, coordination of the members of the supply
chain becomes important  Lack of coordination among the members
will lead to shortages or oversupply in the supply chain
resulting in the inefficiency of the supply chain  Therefore, we
understand that an aggregate plan plays a very important role
across the supply chain  What are the informations which are
planning problem using an example  The learning outcomes
needed for an aggregate plan? An aggregate plan is prepared to
satisfy the fluctuating demand using the controllable variables
over an intermediate time period  So to prepare the plan
the following information are needed: Demand forecast for the
time period, details about the production costs like regular
time production cost, overtime production cost, hiring cost,
layoff cost of the labours, machine hours required for
production, inventory carrying cost, stock out cost or back
ordering cost, constraints on the controllable variables if any 
Then limitations on inventory, safety stock, workforce,
are: An understanding of aggregate planning and its role
overtime, stock quotes, supply contracts, capital constraints
etc should be known when we do the process of aggregate
production planning  In this episode, we have discussed the
role of aggregate production planning in supply chain and
understanding of what aggregate production planning are  In the
next episode, we will discuss about the aggregate planning
strategies  Thank you 
in supply chain  We should have learnt the various strategies
Music
Method one is a graphical and charting techniques,
Music
method two is the mathematical approach,

linear decision rules, linear programming and simulation 
Music
The graphical approach to aggregate planning
Music
Music
is simple

Music
The most profitable combination of variables will be used
Third step is to determine the labor cost,
Music
hiring and firing cost and inventory holding costs 
Music
The next step is to consider the company policy which may apply to the workers
Music
or to the inventories 
Music
Then based on the all information available,
Music
Music
our aggregate production plan is prepared
and compared with the total cost of various alternates
which are available and the best plan is selected for implementation 
Music
Mathematical techniques:
Music
An aggregate planning problem
can be formulated as the linear programming problem
with the objective function of maximizing profit
Supply_chain_Management_6458
to achieve this goal 
or minimizing cost with the constraints 
Music
Solving this linear programming problem
will optimize the decision and give the projection of
various quantities to be produced
Music
to satisfy the demand 
Music
Similarly, an aggregate production planning problem
can be formulated as a transportation model
Music
Music
and solved 
Music
The capacity and the demand constraints are taken as
demand and supply for a transportation problem 
Music
The unit cost of manufacturing
Music
using different controllable variables

will give us the solution for the aggregate production problem,
which has been taken for consideration 
Music
Similarly, simulation is used as a method of solving
in aggregate planning 
three variables, namely

Music
which will help them in planning
and analyzing the various options in aggregate planning
Music
with the inputs from all stakeholders 
Music
This type of simulation models will help the manufacturing plant
to formulate an appropriate manufacturing strategy
Music
to meet the demand of the supply chain 
capacity, inventory, and back ordering 
Music
In this episode, we have discussed
the various methods of aggregate production planning 
Music
In the next episode, we will discuss
Music
an example of aggregate production planning in supply chain management 
Thank you 
Music
In the last episode, we have discussed
If a company uses only one variable
in preparing the aggregate plan, it is called as pure strategy
Music
but when a company uses more than one variable
in preparing an aggregate plan, it is called as a mixed strategy 
Music
Mixed strategy can be: Chase strategy,
cpacity strategy or a level strategy 
Music
Now, let us discuss about the various mixed strategies 
the role of aggregate planning in supply chain 
Music
Chase strategy:
Music
This strategy in aggregate planning
focuses on meeting the required demand
Music
by varying the capacity and the workforce size for the respective periods 
Music
When this strategy is employed, the workforce will be hired
when the demand increases for that period
Music
Music
and the workforce will be laid off
when the demand decreases for that period 
Music
Similarly, the capacity of production is also varied as per their demand 
Music
Capacity strategy:
Music
This strategy in aggregate planning
focuses on meeting the demand
In this episode we will discuss
Music
by planning a constant workforce
for the available capacity and uses time as a variable
to meet the increase in demand 
Music
When the demand increases, the manufacturer works for overtime
Music
to meet the demand of that period 
But when the demand decreases,
Music
about the different aggregate planning strategies 
the manufacturer works with less number of machines
to meet the demand for that period, resulting in idle time for the capacity 
Music
This strategy is more practically
Music
used than the chase strategy,
Music
as varying the workforce size will lead to lower morale
among the workforce and may affect the productivity of the organization 
Music
In preparing the aggregate plan, the planner makes a trade off
The third strategy is known as the level strategy 
Music
This strategy in aggregate planning focuses on meeting their demand
by planning a constant workforce and the constant capacity
to meet the demand requirements 
Music
When the demand is low,
Music
extra production is accumulated as inventory and used later 
Music
among the various variables
If the demand is high,
Music
the demand is met with the accumulated inventory 
Music
If the accumulated inventory is not
enough to meet the demand,
Music
then the manufacturer uses back ordering strategy
and makes the customer wait for the product till the next period 
Music
Music
So that the production of next period
fulfills the demand for the
Music
next requirement of the supply chain 
Music
Methods of preparing an aggregate plan 
Music
There are two methods of preparing
Music
an aggregate plan:
to optimize the cost 
Music
In this example, the total production hours
required is equal to 16,000 into five
and the total production hours available is equal to 125 days into eight 
The calculation goes like this 80,000 divided by 1000
which results in the requirement of 80 workers 
We then calculate the number of units produced with 80 workers for every month 
Units produced every month is equal to
production hours available per worker multiplied by 80
Music
divided by production hours required per unit of production 
which is wishing to set up a production plan for a period of six months 
Once this is calculated, then we calculate the cumulative production required
and the cumulative number of units produced
every month as shown in the table 
Based on this data, find out
if there is a surplus or shortage of production,
which is calculated by the difference between production required
and units produced for each and every month 
If production required is higher than units produced,
then we have a shortage 
If production required is less than the units produced, then we have a surplus 
The information regarding the demand and the number of working days
Based on this, we calculate the surplus cost and shortage cost
for finding out the total cost for this plan 
The total cost for this plan is found out by adding
material cost, labour cost, inventory carrying cost,
surplus cost and shortage cost 
Plan 3:
Plan three is to meet the minimum expected demand
using a constant workforce on regular time for there data given 
Here we are expected to subcontract additional output requirement
if there is a shortage during the month 
for a period of six months is given in the following table 
Minimum expected demand is during April 
For the demand in April, we have to calculate the men required 
Men required is equal to production hours required in April
divided by production hours available in April
which is equal to 8500 divided by 168,
which results in 51 men approximately 
The company has 51 workers for the entire period of six months 
Based on this, we then calculate the number of units produced
every month with the 51 workers available 
Then find out the units produced per month
The other details of the process of manufacturing is also given 
whether it satisfies the production required 
If units produced is more than the requirement,
we have a surplus production,
which is carried to the next month as an inventory 
If the units produced is less than the production required,
we subcontract the shortage units to satisfy the demand for that month 
Using this procedure for the six months period,
we calculate the surplus cost and the subcontracting cost
for calculating the total cost 
Total cost for this plan will be equal to material cost
The material cost is rupees 100 per unit,
plus labour cost plus inventory carrying cost
plus surplus cost plus subcontracting cost 
We have planned the production based on the three plans given 
We have to compare the cost of the three plans and we choose the optimal
total cost plan as the best aggregate planning strategy
to satisfy the demand of the company 
Hence, to improve the profitability of the supply chain 
Summary: In this edition, we have discussed
the significance of aggregate planning in supply chain
and the methods used in aggregate planning 
inventory holding cost is rupees 3 per unit per month 
We understand that aggregate plan
has a significant impact on a supply chain 
A good aggregate plan which is done in collaboration
with the supply chain partners
will lead to an accurate plan for all the members of the supply chain 
The shared outcome of the aggregate plan among the members
of the supply chain will help them to anticipate the demand
and to the customers  It will help them to get a planned supply 
A good appropriate plan will help the supply chain manager
to plan the demand and supply effectively to achieve efficiency of the supply chain 
The marginal cost of stockout is rupees 10 per unit per month 
We will come with another episode till then
thank you 
Music
Marginal cost of subcontracting is rupees 40 per unit,
hiring and training cost is rupees 400 per worker 
Layoff cost is rupees 500 per worker,
In the last two episodes, we have discussed
labour hours required per unit is 5 hours 
Regular time cost is rupees 6 per hour,
overtime cost is rupees 8 per hour,
beginning inventory is 800 units,
safety stock to be maintained
is 25% of the monthly demand 
Based on the given data about the demand, the number of working days,
safety inventory required and the production details,
we have to prepare the actual production required
for the six periods of demand given 
the role of aggregate planning in supply chain
The actual production is calculated based on the inventory on hand
and the safety inventory to be maintained 
Actual production required is equal to
demand minus inventory on hand
plus safety stock to be maintained 
Using this, we prepare the actual production required 
The safety stock maintained for January
will become the inventory on hand for the subsequent month February 
Continue the same process
to get the actual production for the six months period 
and the different aggregate planning strategies 
Once the actual production required is calculated,
we can work on the different plans 
Plan 1: Produce exactly to the monthly requirements
using a regular time production
by varying the workforce size 
To produce exactly to the monthly requirements,
we follow the steps below 
First, Calculate the production hours required every month 
Then calculate the production hours required,
which is equal to production units required for the month
In this episode, we will discuss
multiplied by production hours required per unit 
Then calculate the production hours available per month 
Production hours available per month is equal to
number of working days available per month
multiplied by production hours available per day 
Based on the above calculations,
we can find out the men required for that particular month 
The men required for any month is equal to
production hours required that month
divided by production hours available that month 
Music
We calculate the men required for all the six months period
based on the above calculation 
When we start production we assume that
we have the required manpower to work 
In this example, we have 106 men 
For the second month, the men required is 94
so we layoff 12 workers during the second month 
For the third month, the men required is 60
we layoff 34 workers for the third month 
For the fourth month, demand required is 51
an example of aggregate planning in supply chain 
we layoff 9 workers for the fourth month 
For the fifth month, the men required is 66
we hire 15 workers for the fifth month 
For the sixth month, the men required is 108
so we hire 42 workers for the sixth month 
Once we have calculated the men required for various periods 
Based on the above calculation,
we find out the cost of layoff
and the cost of hiring for every month
depending upon whether the men are laid off or men are hired
We are going to use the graphical technique
as per the cost data given in the problem 
Hiring cost is equal to men hired
multiplied by cost per men hired 
Layoff cost is equal to men laid off
multiplied by cost per men laid off 
After calculating this we can calculate the total cost 
The total cost is depending on material cost,
labour cost, inventory carrying cost, hiring cost and layoff cost 
Total cost is equal to material cost plus labour cost
plus inventory carrying cost plus hiring cost and layoff cost 
in solving the aggregate planning in the supply chain 
Plan 2: Plan two is to produce
to meet the expected average demand
over the six months period
by maintaining a constant workforce 
Inventory is allowed to accumulate with shortages
filled from the next month's production by back ordering 
Constant workforce based on the average demand
over the period of six months is to be calculated,
which is equal to the total production hours required
that month divided by total production hours available 
We take an example of a company in a supply chain
Managing supply and demand  Learning objectives:
The supply chain involves in moving materials from the
supplier point to the customer point through the intermediaries
in a cost effective manner to satisfy the customer  In this
process, we can visualize the information flow, fund flow and
material flow across the supply chain in both directions  The
primary objective of supply chain is to satisfy the customer
needs and generate profit  In a supply chain, we have discussed
in the previous modules, how demand forecasting and aggregate
planning plays a very important role in meeting the expected
demand of the supply chain  When the demand is stable, it is
To understand the concept of predictive variability, to
simple and easy to prepare the aggregate plan but when the demand
is not stable, the process becomes difficult and complex in
preparing the aggregate plan  The variability in the expected
demand may be due to a number of factors like seasonal factors
and non-seasonal factors, which may be price promotion and time 
This variability may have an impact on the supply chain in
meeting the expected demand  Hence, it is important to
understand the concept of predictive variability  What is
predictive variability? Predictive variability is
defined as the change in demand, which can be forecasted and met
analyze the impact of predictive variability in a supply chain, to
by proper planning of supply and demand management across the
supply chain  What is the impact of predictive variability in a
supply chain? Normally, manufacturers plan for a
constant capacity and produce the products accordingly  When
we look into the products, which have seasonal demand, the
manufacturer in the supply chain faces a tough situation in
planning the production as the demand in the peak period is
high leading to stock out situation and during non-peak
period the demand is low leading to accumulation of inventory 
These situations are a challenge for the manufacturer to satisfy
understand the approaches in managing the supply in a supply
the demand across the supply chain  Similarly, when a
retailer offers a promotion, the demand for a product is likely
to increase  This increase in demand is not anticipated by the
manufacturer as he may not know the promotion offer given by
the retailer leading to short supply from the manufacturer 
When a manufacturer uses a pricing strategy, to push the
product into the market, the demand is likely to increase as
the customer would want to get the price advantage  This also
increases the demand and will have a significant impact on the
members of the supply chain, especially the supply side 
chain, to understand the approaches in managing the demand in a
In both the situations, an increase in sales will result in more
profit  To manage such situations, it is always better
to have an informed and collaborative decision across
the members of the supply chain which will help the supply chain
to improve its efficiency 
The variability in demand which is cost across the supply chain
affects them and it can be offset by proper supply
management and demand management  Let us discuss them
in detail one by one Supply management: When there is
variation in demand the manufacturing company in a
supply chain  The learning outcomes are: To have a basic
supply chain can meet the fluctuating demand using two
strategies, namely production capacity strategy and inventory
strategy  Let us discuss the production capacity strategy  By
varying the production capacity the manufacturer can meet the
change in demand either by increase in production or by
decrease in production  Increase in production capacity may be
with additional capacity when there is a increase in demand is
consistent over a period of time  Or if the increase in
demand is only for a short period, then the manufacturer
uses overtime or subcontracting as a strategy to offset the
understanding on the impact of variability in demand, to know
demand  When the demand decreases, then the manufacturer
reduces the production by laying off the workforce to match the
demand resulting in ideal capacity  This strategy helps
the company to minimize the cost and optimize the profit of the
supply chain  In this episode, we have discussed what is the
impact of predictive variability on the supply chain and a basic
introduction to supply management  In the next episode,
we will discuss the different approaches in supply management
in supply chain  Thank you 
the various approaches in managing the supply in supply
chain, to know the various approaches in managing the
demand in a supply chain  Introduction to supply chain 
with different designs, we cannot use the above approach in meeting the demand 
In such cases, the manufacturer is forced to stock
inventory in all the different types of products manufactured by them 
This results in building large quantity of inventory
to meet the fluctuating demand 
Music
The manufacturing of a supply chain uses a
combination of strategies discussed about
to manage the supply in meeting the change in demand
to increase the efficiency of the supply chain 
Flexible workforce and overtime, seasonal workforce,
In this episode we have discussed
the various supply approaches
which are used in supply chain to manage the supply 
In the next episode we will discuss
the process of demand management in supply chain 
Thank you 
outsourcing, dual facility, flexible production lines 
Flexible workforce and overtime 
This approach is used by the manufacturer,
when the workforce is flexible to the working hours 
Many companies work for one shift of eight hours duration
and plan their production capacity according to meet the demand 
When the demand increases marginally
these companies can extend their working hours
depending upon the production required in meeting the demand 
In the last episode we have discussed
The extended time is considered as overtime
and the workforce is paid wages accordingly 
If the increase in demand is too high,
the manufacturer plans for a second shift
and employs part time workers to meet the demand 
In the same way, if the demand decreases,
production capacity is reduced
and the workforce is given a layoff 
This approach can be used on a daily basis
or on a weekly basis or on a monthly basis
the impact of supply and demand management in supply chain 
to meet the required demand 
The second strategy in capacity is seasonal workforce 
Manufacturers plan for a constant production capacity
based on the average demand over a period of time with stable workforce 
When the demand increases during peak season,
the manufacturer employs
part time workers during this season on a temporary basis
to offset the peak season demand 
This helps the manufacturer in managing their supply
across the supply chain in meeting the varying demand 
In this episode we will discuss about the different approaches
The next capacity strategy is outsourcing 
Manufacturer outsources the production during peak season
to manage their supply to meet the varying demand 
The manufacturer production remains constant over a period of time 
The change in demand is outsourced from a chosen vendor
who supplies the product at lower cost 
The use of this approach depends on the availability of sub contractors
who have the capacity and have flexibility
over the quantity required to meet the demand 
When such sub contractors are available,
in supply management in supply chain 
their relationship is more important
for the success of this approach in meeting the varying demand 
Dual facility is another capacity approach in meeting to demand 
Some manufacturers who are original equipment manufacturers a companies
and have specialization in manufacturing certain products
establish two production facility 
One production facility is to cater to the
original equipment manufacturers requirement,
and another production facility is to cater to the other companies
which require similar products with different specification
Approaches in supply management 
of the same product family 
Under these circumstances,
when the demand for the OEM's increase,
they use the second facility to support the increase in demand
over a period of time 
Hence, dual facility of manufacturer
helps them to offset the supply requirements 
Flexible production lines are another capacity strategy
which is used by the manufacturer to meet the varying demand 
This approach is used when the manufacturer has a number of production lines
In managing the variation in demand,
catering to a range of products
belonging to a particular category or product family 
Under this circumstance, this manufacturer can use
additional production line
to meet the increase in demand for a particular product 
If the demand decreases, the production line of the product
is used for manufacturing other products of the company which has a demand 
Hence, product flexible production lines
are used as a capacity strategy for managing the fluctuating demand 
Another strategy which is used by the
the manufacturer uses a combination of
company as a capacity strategy is inventory 
Inventory can be used as a strategy for meeting the
fluctuating demand across the supply chain 
In managing the variation in demand,
the manufacturer uses a combination
of inventory approaches to manage the supply 
The approaches used by the manufacturer are
using common components and building inventory 
A Manufacturer who manufactures number of products
in the product category uses
capacity approaches to manage the supply 
the approach of using common components to meet the fluctuating demand 
This type of manufacturer has to design the products
in such a way that they have common components 
When they have such products
these manufacturers have the options of manufacturing the common components
in bulk quantity and maintain an inventory, which can be used
at the time of varying demand of various products 
This helps the manufacturer to offset the demand across the supply chain
and improve its efficiency 
But if the manufacturer has different types of products
The approaches used by the manufacturer are:
In the last two episodes, we have discussed the impact of
Retailers in the supply chain use promotion as a strategy to
increase the sales of products 
The decision taken by the retailer on promotion is not a
collaborative decision and hence the members of the supply
chain may not be aware of such a move 
When such decisions are made by the retailer, it will have an
impact on the members of the supply chain as the promotion
offered by the retailer will increase the sales 
When sales increases, the retailer expects the stocks to
be refilled  This increase in demand may not be anticipated by
supply and demand management in supply chain and the different
the warehouse or the members of the supply chain resulting in a
stock out situation 
Hence in managing the demand during such situation, it is
advised that the retailers discuss the promotion offer and
the timing of the offer with the members of the supply chain and
take a collaborative decision, which will help the members of the
supply chain to be prepared to meet the varying or increase in
demand 
Similarly, when the manufacturer is willing to offer price
discounts on products, it should be discussed with the members of
approaches of supply management in supply chain  In this episode
the supply chain as the price discounts will have an impact on
the demand  Hence, the members of the supply chain are expected
to discuss and decide the pricing strategy and the
promotion strategy to be offered to ease out the production and
supply of products across the supply chain keeping in mind the
production cost and the overall supply chain cost 
Members also have to discuss on how the profit generated in the
supply chain is to be shared among them to enhance the
efficiency of the supply chain and understanding between the
members will help them to work together better 
we will discuss about the approaches in demand management
Hence, we understand that when there is a variation in demand,
the manufacturer uses a combination of approaches:
Production capacity, inventory and pricing to manage the supply
and demand across the supply chain to maximize its profits 
Summary: We can understand that to manage the
predictable variation in demand in a supply chain coordination
among the supply chain members is essential 
They have to share information across them collaborate to align
in the right direction to meet the demand  Similarly, a
constant monitoring of the predictive variation will help
in supply chain 
the supply chain to make strategic decisions in terms of
capacity enhancement, supplier contracts, pricing strategy to
enhance the responsiveness of the supply chain 
The objective of the supply chain is to cater to the demand
of the customer at the lowest cost  A supply chain achieves this
by managing the supply and demand across the supply chain 
To manage the supply a manufacturer uses: Workforce
flexibility, time, outsourcing, dual facility, flexible
production lines to augment the demand  To manage the demand
manufacturers use pricing and promotion strategies along with
Managing demand 
collaborative effort of the supply chain members to augment
the supply 
Appropriate use of aggregate plan across the supply chain
helps the supply chain to maximize its profitability as
well as meet the fluctuating demand  Thank you!
Promotion and pricing strategies have an impact on the supply
chain and cause a variation in demand across the supply chain 
We will discuss how this impact is managed by the supply chain

To understand the role and impact of cycle inventory in a supply chain,
to have a thorough knowledge on the various costs
of inventory and its impact on cycle inventory,
to have an understanding the impact of economies of scale on cycle inventory,
understanding the impact of quantity discount,
and trade promotion on cycle inventory and there by supply chain 
Introduction to supply chain 
The supply chain involves in moving materials
from the supplier point to the customer point
through the intermediaries in a cost- effective manner to satisfy the customer 
Managing economics of scale in supply chain,
In this process we can visualize
information flow, fund flow and material flow
across the supply chain in both directions 
The primary objective of the supply chain
is to satisfy the customer needs and generate profit 
Let us look into the impact of cycle inventory and supply chain 
In a supply chain the members in the supply chain
buy more than their requirement to get the benefit of
economies of scale, which lowers their total cost 
When such decisions are made by the members they allow
and introduction to you on the impact of cycle Inventory 
accumulating inventory for a particular cycle 
The average inventory maintained by the members of the supply chain
is either due to production or due to purchases
in economic lot sizes that are larger than their requirement,
which is known as cycle inventory 
When demand is constant, cycle inventory
and lot sizes are related, where cycle inventory is half of average inventory 
Let us now discuss, the role of cycle inventory in a supply chain 
Larger the cycle inventory, longer the lag time
between production of a product and its sales 
The learning objectives of this module are:
Long time lags make the firm vulnerable
to demand changes of the market place 
Lower cycle inventory decreases the lag time
and matches with the demand requirement of the market 
It also decreases the organization working capital requirement 
Hence, it is suggested to have a reduced cycle inventory,
but one has to understand the impact of the reduced lot size on the cost
and the performance of the supply chain 
Cycle inventory is maintained to take advantage of the economies of scale
to reduce the cost across the supply chain 
To understand the role of cycle inventory in a supply chain,
The various costs that influence the lot size are average price paid
per unit of the product purchased, fixed costs ordering
and the holding cost 
The average price paid by the purchaser
is an important cost in lot size decision 
When the purchase price per unit is reduced for an increased lot size,
the buyer may buy more which will affect the lot size and in turn the cycle inventory 
The fixed ordering cost includes all the cost
associated with ordering and receiving the material 
It remains constant and do not vary with lot sizes 
to understand the impact of various costs on determining the optimal inventory,
When lot sizes increases,
fixed ordering cost per unit purchased decreases 
This motivates the buyer to buy more 
Holding cost is the cost of carrying inventory
in stores for a specified period of time, normally it is one year 
The holding cost increases with increase in lot size 
Holding cost is calculated as a percentage of purchase price
when we use economies of scale and buy lot sizes 
The lot size to be bought by the buyer is influenced by these three costs
that is purchase price per unit, ordering cost per order
to understand the impact of economies of scale on cycle inventory,
and holding cost per unit per year 
The role of cycle inventory is to allow the members in the supply chain
to purchase products in different lot sizes
that minimizes the cost of material, ordering cost and holding cost 
If the manager considers the holding cost,
he will reduce the lot size resulting in decrease in cycle inventory 
If he considers material and ordering cost,
he will increase the lot size resulting in increase in cycle inventory 
Hence, a trade off is expected to be made to minimize the total cost,
when making lot size decisions 
to understand the impact of quantity discounts,
This lot size decision influences the cycle inventory maintained
across the members of the supply chain 
We can understand from the discussion that cycle inventory
exists in a supply chain when the members use economies of scale
to lower the total cost and it plays an important role
in the performance of the supply chain 
In this edition, we have discussed the role of cycle inventory in supply chain 
In the next edition, we will discuss
the impact of economies of scale on cycle inventory 
Thank you 
and trade promotions on lot size and cycle inventory 
Music
The learning outcomes are:
In the last edition, we discussed the role of cycle
In this edition, we have discussed the impact of
economies of scale on cycle inventory

Music
It provides a proportionate savings in costs gained by an
increased level of production  So, economies of scale is going
to be advantages for any company 
Supply chain exploits economies of scale
during its replenishment decision 
The decisions
are made under three different conditions:
One: Fixed cost is incurred each time
an order is placed or purchased 
Two: When the supplier offers price discounts
inventory in supply chain 
based on the quantity purchased lot 
When the supplier offers trade promotions for a
third specified period which is the third option 
Music
Fixed costs associated in buying lot sizes
are associated with placing, receiving
and transportation costs 
A purchase manager looks at minimizing the total cost
in satisfying the demand in making the appropriate trade off
among the costs when making the lot size decision 
In this edition we will discuss the
Music
Let us take an example of lot sizing for a single product 
When buying a single product, the purchase
manager makes the lot sizing decision based on the following assumptions 
The assumptions are: Demand and lead time are known
and constant, replenishment of stock is instantaneous,
and no quantity discount is available 
Music
Under such conditions, if the following inputs are available,
we calculate the total cost 
impact of economies of scale on cycle inventory 
Music
Let D be the annual demand,
S be the fixed cost of ordering per order,
C be the cost of the material per unit
and "h" be the percentage of holding cost per unit of the
material cost 
Then, the total annual cost is calculated by
adding ordering cost plus holding cost plus cost of material 
Mathematically, total cost is equal to D by Q into S
plus Q by 2 into Ch plus DC 
Music
The objective of the manager is to minimize the total costs 
By using the maxima, minima rule of differentiation,
when we differentiate the above equation with respect to Q
and equating to zero, we get the optimal lot size Q star 
So, Q star is equal to square root of two DS divided by h into C 
With each lot size Q star, the cycle inventory
will be the average inventory Q star by 2 
When lot sizes increases, cycle inventory increases 
Music
Total ordering cost and holding cost will be same at the point of
Economies of scale are cost advantages reaped by companies
economic lot size 
An organization may order a convenient lot size
closer to the economic lot size to set the advantage of
the economies of scale 
If the demand increases,
the optimal lot size increases where as the flow times decreases 
If the demand decreases, the optimal lot size
decreases whereas the flow time increases 
When the manager wants to have a desired lot size,
he has to reduce the fixed order cost
when production becomes efficient 
to minimize the total cost 
Music
Let us take an another example of getting the total cost benefit 
Music
It is to aggregate multiple products in a single order 
Music
To reduce the lot size, the manager has to understand the fixed cost 
A major fixed cost is the transportation cost 
When a company has an array of products, each product is
managed independently which results in higher fixed cost
It is obtained with the scale of operation
increasing the cycle inventory 
So, aggregating orders and delivering across the number of products
will lower the cycle inventories 
In this process of aggregating we should consider
the fixed costs of receiving or loading cost 
When varieties of products are transported, warehouse has to be
updated with the inventory records of multiple products
received and they should allocate separate space for storing the items 
Thus when planning for a reduced lot size
we should focus on reducing these costs 
with the cost per unit of output
Use of appropriate technology
to share electronically details of the suppliers
and the use of RFID technology help them to reduce
the fixed cost of receiving an optimal lot size leading to
reduced cycle inventory 
We have discussed how fixed ordering costs
impact on the inventory stocked and the costs in a supply chain 
Reduction in lot size has to be done with increasing the cost,
reducing the fixed cost associated with each lot by aggregating lots
across multiple products, customers or suppliers 
decreasing with increasing scale 
Cycle inventory generally equals half of the lot size 
In determining the optimal quantity of cycle inventory,
the supply chain goal is to minimize the total cost 
Economic order quantity balances all the cost
associated with the inventory to determine the optimal order size 
When order cost and transportation cost increases,
the lot size and cycle inventory increases 
Lot size based quantity discounts increase the lot size
and cycle inventory in the supply chain as they
encourage buyers to buy larger quantities
Second type of discount is based on the total quantity
to take advantage of discounted price 
Quantity discounts increase total supply chain profits 
Volume discounts are more effective than lot based discounts
in increasing the supply chain profits
with increasing lot size and cycle inventory 
Trade promotion increases inventory and the total supply chain cost
through forward buying 
The increased inventory increases the cycle inventory
and the flow time 
Hence, to reduce the lot size and cycle inventory in the
bought over a period of time irrespective of lot size purchased 
supply chain without increasing the cost,
a manager has to reduce the fixed ordering cost,
the transportation cost and implement volume based discount schemes 
In these modules, we have discussed impact of
the economies of scale on cycle inventory 
Thank you 
Music
The lot size discounts are of two types,
all unit quantity discount, and marginal unit quantity discount 
All unit quantity discount contains specific break points
with price schedules 
For example, a price break for a
different quantity can be as follows:
The quantity can be less than the x unit x one units,
In the last edition, we have discussed the impact of
where the price is P1 and quantity between X1 to X2
the price may be P2 the quantity greater than X2,
the price may be P3 
Based on the above and if the annual demand is "D",
ordering cost is "S", and
percentage of carrying cost is "H", we can calculate the
economic order quantity for the above instances 
Using all the three prices P1, P2, P3,
we calculate the economic lot size,
which may be economic lot size 1 corresponding to price P1,
economies of scale on cycle inventory 
economic lot size 2 corresponding to P2,
economic lot size 3 corresponding to price P3 
The economic lot size calculated thus should be checked
if the value falls in the quantity range offered 
Only one economic lot size value will fall in the range of the quantity 
That economic lot size is the correct economic lot size
for the company 
The objective of the manager is to minimize the total cost 
We have to calculate the total cost for the economic lot size 
When a larger quantity is available for the quantity discount,
In this edition we will discuss the impact of quantity discounts
we have to calculate the total cost of that quantity
and compare with the costs calculated earlier 
Comparing the cost, the manager selects the lowest total cost option 
Music
Pricing schedules with this type of quantity discounts
encourage retailers to buy large lots to take advantage of the
price discounts 
This will increase the cycle inventory
and increase the flow time in a supply chain 
Music
and promotion on cycle inventory and the supply chain 
Marginal unit quantity discount model:
This type of quantity discount has a
price schedule for specified break points of quantities 
This method uses the marginal cost of a unit at a break point 
Music
If an order is placed for X quantity, the first range X0 to X1
units are priced at price P1 
The next range X1 to X2 units are
priced at price 2 P2, and it goes so on 
The marginal cost per unit varies with quantity purchased
In business to business transactions,
and accordingly the total cost is calculated
as discussed before 
Music
Quantity discounts lead to a significant buildup of cycle inventory
in a supply chain rather than increase the fixed ordering cost 
Quantity discounts are important in supply chain
to have an improved coordination to increase supply chain profit
and extract the surplus through price discrimination 
Music
Independent decision making on quantity discounts
two types of discounts are offered to the buyers 
by the members of the supply chain may benefits
individual members and not the entire supply chain 
Hence, a coordinated decision among the members of the supply chain
will maximize the total supply chain profits,
when all the members will get benefitted 
Music
Manufacturers use trade promotion to offer a discounted
price at a time when the discount is effective 
Sometimes they also support retailers
on specific promotions at different period of time during the year 
One type of discount is based on the quantity bought per order-
Trade promotions influences retailers
to buy more and help the manufacturer to achieve their objectives
of moving the product across the supply chain 
When the retailers use the trade promotion he may respond by
passing the total profit or part of the profit to the customer to
increase sales 
This action of the retailer leading to increased purchases
increases sales for the entire supply chain 
Sometimes he may share very little of the promotion to
the customers and build inventory using the reduced price
if you buy more you get a discount
for meeting the future demand  This results in increased cycle
inventory and increased flow time within the supply chain 
Trade promotion leads to a significant increase in lot size
and cycle inventory as the retailers adopt a forward buying strategy
to avail the benefits 
This results in reduce supply chain profits
unless the trade promotion reduces the demand fluctuations

which is known as lot size discount 
As the demand is normalized the service level
can be represented as 'z' 
Music
The value for 'z' can be calculated from the normal distribution table
and the safety inventory can be calculated accordingly,
where mathematically <eqn>safety inventory will be equal to
Z into sigma D into square root of L </eqn>
Music
Product availability is defined as
the firm's ability to meet the customer demand
Music
from the available inventory 
If the firm is not able to meet the demand
from the available inventory,
it results in stock out situation 
Hence, safety inventory helps the firm
to avoid stock out situations 
Product availability depends on
product fill rate, order fill rate, and cycle service level 
Music
Product fill rate is that part of demand
The Learning Outcomes of this module are:
which is satisfied from product inventory 
Music
Fill rate is equivalent to the probability of product demand
met from the available inventory 
Music
Order fill rate is that part of orders
which are filled from the available inventory 
To have a higher order fill rates
the firm has to stock enough inventories of all products
that the firm produces 
To know the role and impact of safety inventory in a supply chain,
Music
Cycle service level is the that part of the replenishment cycle
which meets the customer demand 
A replenishment cycle is the time gap between
two successive order deliveries 
Cycle service level is the probability of not having
a stock out in a replenishment cycle period

Introduction to safety inventory 
Music
Learning objectives of this module are:
Inventory is the stock maintained in stores to take care of
demand requirements of the production department or
the members in the supply chain to meet the customer requirements 
Inventory is determined by analyzing the demand rate
and the lead time of the supply 
Music
When the demand and lead time are constant,
the need for inventory is also known and constant 
But when demand and lead time or either one of them varies,
there is a chance of stock out 
To understand the role of safety
To offset this situation
an extra quantity of stock more than the forecasted demand is
maintained in stores 
This stock is known as safety stock or safety inventory 
Let us now discuss the role of safety inventory in supply chain 
The availability of safety inventory ensures
the product availability under varying demand conditions
to satisfy the customer requirement 
Though this satisfies the customer requirements,
it increases the amount of inventory held and thereby
inventory in a supply chain,
increases the holding cost 
Carrying excessive inventory can help to meet the demand variation
but can affect the company,
if new products come into the market,
the existing inventory will become obsolete
and cost the company 
Music
Thus, the key to success of any supply chain will be
to identify the optimum level of inventory to be carried
without affecting the cost, keeping in mind the product availability 
to understand the factors
Music
In planning the safety inventory, the supply chain manager
has two key objectives 
One is to plan the appropriate level of safety inventory
and the second one is to improve the product availability
while reducing the safety inventory 
Music
Let us discuss the supply chain uncertainty
and how it impacts safety inventory 
Music
influencing the required level of safety inventory,
Supply chain uncertainty in supply and demand
warrants high level of safety inventory 
Music
Let us now assume that the average demand
per period is defined as 'D' 
Music
When number of observations are taken,
we can normalize the demand
which will follow normal distribution
with a mean and standard deviation 
to understand the different measures of product availability,
The standard deviation of demand per period
can be assume to be sigma 'D' 
Music
Lead time is the gap between ordering the material and
receiving the same to use 
It can be denoted by 'L' 
When demand and lead time are constant,
the safety inventry required is zero 
Music
The requirement of safety inventory arises only when there
to understand the process of lowering safety
is an uncertainty in demand and lead time 
Music
When demand is uncertain
the safety inventory is determined based on the
standard deviation of demand and the lead time,
which can be mathematically given as
<eqn>safety inventory is equal to sigma d into square root of l </eqn>
Music
The extent of safety inventory to be stocked
depends on the service level expected by the organization 
inventory and improving product availability 
In the last edition,
which reduces the uncertainty in demand 
Music
Improved coordination and sharing of
information among the members of the supply chain often reduces
the uncertainty resulting in reduction of safety inventory
within the supply chain to improve its performance 
Music
Let us now discuss the impact of replenishment policies
on safety inventory 
Music
when to reorder and how much to reorder 
When we follow continuous review policy:
A supply chain manager analyzes the uncertainty in demand
during lead time to adjust the timing of replenishment order
under this policy 
Music
The manager has no recourse during the lead time
once he places the order 
The available safety inventory should take care of
the uncertainty in demand till the new supply arrives 
This is the characteristics of
This determines the cycle and safety inventory carried by the firm 
continuous review policy and safety inventory in a supply chain 
Music
Periodic review policies:
A supply chain manager reviews the inventory level
at regular intervals of time and an order is placed
to top up the level of inventory from the current level
taking into consideration the demand during lead time
to the top up level 
This review policy is simple and easy for the members
in the supply chain to follow 
Music
The manager has to plan the safety inventory
which will cater to the demand during the order interval time 
Music
Periodic review replenishment policy
requires more safety stock than continuous replenishment
policy for the same level of product 
In this edition, we have discussed
the impact of replenishment policy on safety inventory 
In the next edition, we will discuss the impact of
aggregation of inventory on safety inventory
Let us discuss what a continuous review policy is?
in the supply chain to make the product availability and improve
the performance of the supply chain 
Thank you 
Music
Inventory levels are continuously monitored during consumption 
When the inventory level reaches the reorder point,
the firm decides to buy a lot size of 'Q' quantities 
This system is followed continuously
to determine the replenishment period
we have discussed the role of safety inventory in supply chain 
which may vary based on demand 
Music
Periodic Review policy 
Music
Inventory levels are monitored at regular intervals of time
during consumption 
Music
During the review time, the firm places order
to rise the inventory level to the top up level,
that is the maximum level 
In this edition, we will discuss the impact of
When we follow this policy, the time between orders is fixed
whereas the quantity order every time
varies based on the demand or consumption 
Music
The reorder point is calculated based on the average demand rate,
lead time, variation in demand, variation in lead time,
and service level of the firm 
In general, reorder point is equal to lead time demand plus safety stock 
Music
If 'D' is the average demand rate,
replenishment policies on safety inventory 
'L' is the average lead time,
sigma d is the standard deviation of demand,
sigma L is the standard deviation of lead time
and 'z' is the service level expected of the firm,
we can calculate the reorder point on different situations 
Music
Situation 1:
Music
When demand and lead time are constant 
Then the ROP is calculated by,
Music
mathematically <eqn>ROP is equal to D into L </eqn>
Music
Situation 2:
When demand is varying and lead time is constant 
The ROP is calculated by, mathematically
<eqn>ROP is equal to D into L plus Z into sigma D into square root of L,</eqn>
where sigma D is the standard deviation of demand L is the
lead time and Z is the service level 
Situation 3:
Demand is constant and lead time is varying 
Replenishment policy on safety inventory 
Then the ROP is calculated by, mathematically
<eqn>ROP is equal to D into L plus Z into D into sigma L </eqn>
Music
Situation 4:
Demand and lead time both varying 
Then the ROP is calculated by, mathematically
<eqn>ROP is equal to D into L plus Z into square root of sigma D
square into L plus D square into sigma L square,</eqn>
Music
where sigma D is standard deviation of demand L is the lead time
When we discuss the replenishment of products,
D is the average demand sigma L is the standard deviation of lead time
and Z is the service level 
Music
We calculate ROP based on the uncertainty in supply and demand
using the above conditions 
Music
The fill rate and the cycle service level
increases as the safety stock increases 
The required safety inventory increases with the increase in lead time
and the standard deviation of demand 
the firm may follow either a continuous replenishment policy
Music
With the increased safety inventory the desired product
availability increases to satisfy the demand of the customers 
Music
The goal of the supply chain manager is to reduce the
safety inventory level in such a way that it does
not affect the product availability to satisfy the customers 
To achieve this, the manager has two options,
Music
Reduction in lead time 'L' or reduce the uncertainty in demand 
or a periodic review replenishment policy 
Music
Reduction in lead time is possible if there is an
understanding with the supplier and a coordinated effort in
planning the supply chain demand, which reduces the
safety inventory at the retailer point 
Music
Reduction in demand uncertainty is possible
if there is a good forecasting technique,
a good market intelligence system, and
coordinated effort of the supply chain members,
The replenishment policy decides
to cater to the fluctuating demand or have an
aggregate inventory of different products in each region to cater
to the demand 
Aggregation decreases the safety inventory
and increases the desired cycle service level and
product availability 
When aggregation takes place, it may
increase the response time to customer order and increase the
transportation cost to the customer 
Aggregation can also happen
In the last edition we have discussed the impact of
without having the physical centralization of inventory into one location 
This may be possible by centralization of information 
When information is centralized,
the orders are filled from the closest warehouse
where the products are stored 
Music
If the stock level is less than the demand,
then the required quantity of products are moved
from the next nearest warehouse to satisfy the demand requirements
keeping the transportation cost as low as possible 
replenishment policies on safety inventory 
This reduces the amount of safety inventory to be maintained
for providing a high level of product availability 
Substitution:
Substitution is referred to a situation where a
demand for one product is met with a different product to
satisfy the customer 
This can happen under two different conditions or instances 
One, manufacturer driven substitution
and the other one is customer driven substitution 
Manufacturer driven substitution, where the manufacturer substitutes
In this edition, we will discuss the impact of aggregation of inventory
a higher value product for a lower value product 
When the lower value product is out of stock
the manufacturer uses this  Manufacturer driven substitution
helps the supply chain to increase the overall
profitability of the supply chain members by allowing
aggregation of demand, which reduces the inventory requirement
for the availability of products 
Music
Second, customer driven substitution
is where the customers make the decision
on safety inventory and product availability in the supply chain 
to buy a substitute product to satisfy their requirement 
Recognition of a customer driven substitution and jointly managing
the inventory across the supply chain with
substitution products allows the supply chain to reduce the
requirement of safety inventory while satisfying the product availability 
Music
Another aggregation strategy is usage of common components 
Music
When we use common components for reducing
the safety inventory across a supply chain it is the process
Aggregation of safety inventory:
of designing and manufacturing common components for products
which are manufactured by the company 
Common components reduce the safety inventory to be stored
for making the product available 
Music
Postponement is another strategy which can be
used in aggregation of inventory  Postponement is the ability of the
supply chain to delay the product differentiation until
the product is sold in the market 
As a result of this most of the inventories in the supply chain
Supply chains have varying degree of inventory aggregation 
are aggregated to reduce the safety inventory
without affecting the product availability 
Music
In the three modules discussed, we have discussed the role of
safety inventory in supply chain, the impact of
replenishment policies on supply chain, the impact of aggregation
of inventory on supply chain and making the product available in
the supply chain with the reduced safety inventory 
To summarize safety inventory helps the supply chain to
provide the customers high level of product availability under
One is to aggregate all inventories to a centralized place
the conditions of uncertainty in supply and demand 
Safety inventory is influenced by demand uncertainty, lead time,
variation in demand and lead time 
An increase in these factors increases the safety inventory 
The replenishment policy of the firm
also influences the safety inventory 
The required level of safety inventory can be reduced and
product availability can be improved, if the members in the
supply chain can reduce the demand variability, lead time
variability, and exploit the aggregation of inventories 
and serve the customers as when the demand arises 
Proper co-ordination and information sharing among the
members of the supply chain can lead to reduction in safety
inventory without affecting the product availability 
This reduces the safety inventory to be maintained
to satisfy the product availability to meet the customer demand 
For a seasonal product,
cycle service level determines the optimal stock level
to be maintained to satisfy the demand
based on the cost of overstocking, and the cost of under stocking 
Music
Let 'c' be the cost per unit of the product,
'p' be the selling price per unit of the product
and 's' be the salvage value per unit of the product,
then, cost of overstocking per unit is given by <eqn>Co is equal to c minus s</eqn>
To appreciate the importance of product availability in a supply chain,
cost of under stocking per unit is given by <eqn>Cu is equal to p minus C</eqn>
Supply_chain_Management_7770
we can calculate the cycle service level z,
where <eqn>z is equal to cu divided by cu plus co </eqn>
When quantity discounts Cd are available for the product,
then cost of overstocking and cost of under stocking
are calculated as below,
cost of overstocking is equal to p minus Cd,
cost of understocking is equal to Cd minus s 
When the demand for a product in the supply chain increases,
to have a thorough knowledge on the various factors
the supply chain has two options to consider 
If the demand increases it results in stock out of the product 
The first option is to backlog the out of stock product
and filled latter, when replenishment of inventories takes place 
In this case no demand is lost,
minimizing the costs becomes equivalent to maximizing profit 
If the supply chain manager increases the level of safety inventory,
the backlogging cost gets reduced
but inventory holding cost increases 
Hence, the supply chain manager should balance these two costs
influencing product availability in a supply chain,
to find out the optimal cycle service level,
which determines the optimum quantity to be stocked
for increasing the profit of the supply chain 
Music
The second option is the supply chain manager can make a decision of
losing the demand for the out of stock units 
Music
In this edition we have discussed the importance of
product availability in a supply chain and the factors affecting
the product availability 
to have a knowledge on the various methods
In the next edition, we will discuss the different methods
in determining the product availability in a supply chain 
Thank you 
available to determine the product availability in a supply chain 
Music
Introduction to supply chain:
A Supply chain involves in moving materials
from the supplier point to the customer point through the
intermediaries in a cost-effective manner to satisfy the customer 
Module Three, determining optimum level of product availability 
In this process we can visualize information flow,
fund flow, and material flow across the supply chain in both directions 
The primary objective of supply chain is to
satisfy the customer needs and generate profit 
Music
Let us now look into what product availability mean?
Product availability is defined as the firm's ability to meet
the customer demand from the available inventory 
If the firm is not able to meet the demand
from the available inventory,
Learning objectives are: To understand the
it results in stock out situation 
Hence, safety inventory helps the firm
to avoid stock out situations 
Product availability depends on product fill rate,
order fill rate, and cycle service level 
Music
Product fill rate is that part of demand
which is satisfied from product inventory 
Fill rate is equivalent to the probability of
product demand met from the available inventory 
importance of product availability in a supply chain,
Music
Order fill rate is that part of orders which are
filled from the available inventory 
To have a higher order fill rates
the firm has to stock enough inventories of all products
that the firm produces 
Music
Cycle service level is that part of the replenishment cycle
which meets the customer demand 
A replenishment cycle is the time gap between
to understand the factors affecting product availability
two successive order deliveries 
Cycle service level is the probability of not having a stock out
in a replenishment cycle period 
It is denoted by 'z' as discussed earlier the service level 
Music
Importance of product availability:
The supply chain can use a high level of product availability to
improve its responsiveness and attract customers to buy products
which will increase the revenue of the supply chain 
High level of product availability requires large amount of inventories
in a supply chain,
which increases the supply chain cost 
Hence, a supply chain has to balance the level of product availability
and the cost of inventory to find out the optimal level of product
it can stock that maximizes the profit of the supply chain 
Music
Factors affecting the optimal level of product availability 
The objective of a supply chain
is to satisfy the expectation of the customer 
In meeting the expectation of the customer,
the supply chain is expected to build enough inventory
to understand the methods of determining
to meet the demand of the customer 
Building inventory helps the supply chain
to improve its responsiveness, but increases the holding cost 
When the supply chain maintains a high level of product availability
and if the demand turns out to be low,
the supply chain accumulates inventory and this may result in
a cost to the supply chain known as cost of overstocking 
Cost of overstocking is defined as the loss incurred by the supply chain
for each unsold item at the end of the selling period 
Similarly if the supply chain maintains a lower product availability
product availability in a supply chain 
to reduce the holding cost and if the demand turns out to be high,
the supply chain has to turn away certain customers
who are willing to buy, which may results in a cost to
the supply chain known as the cost of under stocking 
Cost of under stocking
is defined as the margin lost by the supply chain
for each lost sales of the product 
Hence, these two factors that is cost of over stocking
and cost of under stocking influence the optimal product availability
in a supply chain 
Music
A supply chain in determining the optimal product quantity
analyzes these two costs based on the expected demand
that is forecasted and calculates the expected profit 
A plot of the total expected profit and the order quantity
explicitly shows the optimal order quantity
that the supply chain can stock in order to maximize the profits 
When these two costs changes, the optimal quantity also changes 
Music
Optimum cycle service level and the costs 
Cycle service level determines the safety inventory to be stocked
The learning outcomes are:
product availability to increase the profitability of the supply chain 
To summarize: Product availability ensures
higher level of customer satisfaction 
The factors influencing the level of product availability are
cost of overstocking and cost of under stocking 
These two cost are to be balanced
to determine the optimal level of product availability 
A manager improves the supply chain profitability
by maintaining optimal level of product availability
or optimal level of cycle service level by increasing the
Supply chain managers adopt different approaches
salvage value of each unit of the product overstocked,
decreasing the margin loss from stock out situation per unit,
using improved forecast to reduce uncertainty,
using quick response to reduce lead times,
using postponement strategy to delay product differentiation,
and using tailored sourcing to meet the demand requirement 
Music
to increase the profitability of the supply chain 
Approach 1: The manager has to increase the salvage value of each unit 
He can plan to sell the overstock products
in outlet stores located at different location
rather than discarding them 
By this the salvage value increases 
When salvage value increases, it increases the profitability of
the supply chain as well as the optimal cycle inventory 
Music
In the last edition we have discussed the importance of
Approach 2:
The manager has to decrease the margin lost from stock out 
He can make arrangements with
backup sourcing to get stock and satisfy the demand
or he could arrange for substitute products to satisfy the customer 
This decreases the margin lost from stock out 
When the margin lost from stock out of each unit is decreased,
it increases profitability of the supply chain
as well as the optimal cycle inventory 
Music
product availability in a supply chain and the factors affecting
Approach 3:
The manager has to reduce the demand uncertainty to match
supply and demand thereby reducing the cost of overstocking
and cost of under stocking 
To reduce demand uncertainty
the manager uses the following strategies:
He can use improved forecasting,
quick response, postponement and tailored sourcing 
Music
Improved forecast:
the product availability 
The members of the supply chain co-ordinate with each other
and share information about the customer requirements
to improve the forecast accuracy 
A shared demand planning information across
the supply chain helps to achieve this 
With improved forecast accuracy,
the manager of the supply chain reduces the demand
uncertainty to decrease the cost of overstocking and under stocking
for increasing the profitability of the supply chain 
Music
In this edition we will discuss the different methods
Quick response:
The members of the supply chain
plan to reduce the replenishment lead time
for achieving the quick response to the customer demand 
When lead time decreases, the forecast accuracy improves 
This helps the supply chain to match the supply
with demand and thereby increase the
profitability of the supply chain 
Music
The third strategy can be postponement 
in determining the product availability in a supply chain 
Individual product forecast gives greater accuracy of demand
close to the sale of a product  The supply chain manager uses
this information to delay the product differentiation
until the sale of the product,
which is known as postponement strategy 
This allows supply chain manager to better match the supply with
the demand 
If the supply chain postpones the product differentiation,
a significant increase in profits
and reduction in inventory can be achieved 
Methods of determining product availability:
Music
The other strategy is tailored sourcing 
The supply chain manager develops two
sources of supply for the products 
One focuses on cost
and has the capacity to meet the predictable portion of the demand 
The second source will have flexibility and will be
responsive to meet the uncertain portion of the demand 
This strategy to have two sources to match the supply and demand
is known as tailored sourcing 
The cost of overstocking and the cost of under stocking directly
Tailored sourcing increases the profitability of the supply chain 
Music
When we use tailored sourcing there are two types:
One may be based on volume which is called as
volume based tailored sourcing 
And the other one may be based on product
which is called as product based tailored sourcing 
Volume based tailored sourcing is the process of
producing the predictable demand in an efficient facility
and the uncertain portion of the demand
influenced the optimal level of product quantity,
is produced at a flexible facility 
Product based tailored sourcing is the process of producing
high volume products with less uncertainty
in an efficient facility and low volume uncertain demand produced
at a flexible facility 
Music
In the two modules we have discussed
the importance of product availability in supply chain,
the factors affecting the product availability in a supply chain
and the different methods available in determining the
optimal cycle service level and profitability of the supply chain 
has a current salvage value of rupees 2 lakh
and the remaining of 6 years  The existing warehouse was
initially purchased for rupees 10 lakh and is being depreciated
on the basis of straight line method 
The new warehouse needs an investment of rupee 14 lakh
and will be subject to the same method of depreciation 
The asset has an expected useful life of 6 years,
salvage value of rupees 2 lakh at the sixth-years end 
The management anticipates that with the expanded operations,
there will be a need of
know intra organization transfers in supply chain planning
an additional net working capital of rupee 1 lakh 
The new warehouse will allow the firm
to expand current operations and hereby
increase annual revenues by rupees 4,96,000 after 30% variable cost ratio 
Fixed costs excluding depreciation is
predicted to remain unchanged 
The corporate taxes 35% and its cost of capital is 10% 
Financial evaluation whether to replace existing warehouse

considering the cost of the new machine,
and transfer pricing methods,
the additional working capital required,
and the salvage value of existing warehouse
is found to be rupees 13 lakh 
Determination of incremental cash flow after tax 
Incremental cash flow after tax considering the tax
and depreciation is found to be 3 lakh 92,400 
Determination of net present value 
Net present value is found to be positive
of rupees 5 lakh 77,902 considering
the cash flow after tax for the 6 years

The analysis shows positive NPV
for the proposal of establishing a new warehouse
concluding not to promote and it is found to be conducive
to establish the new warehouse in due course of the business
to overcome the present constraints of existing warehouse 
In the above analysis the major determinants of decisions are
cash outflow and cash inflow
which subsequently affects the decision 
on transfer pricing under different decision situations 
Cash inflows are subjected to incremental benefit and operating cost 
Cost factors obviously are
influenced by major strategies in a supply chain 
Systematic evaluation of supply chain decisions
which affects long term distribution system
of the organization would reduce
future uncertainties and overcome loss
due to wrong long term decisions 
Let us discuss in the next video on
supply chain strategy and cost an intra firm transfers
Learning outcomes: At the end of
and transfer pricing methods 
this session, learners would be able to gain knowledge on the
need for financial evaluation of supply chain decisions,
comprehend the methods of transfer pricing,
apply transfer pricing methods in financial evaluation of
intra organization transfers under different situations
Dear learners!
when there is external supply and demand,
optimum utilization of resources and differential tax rates 
In the first video we will focus on supply chain design
and evaluation of cash flow using net present value technique 
Let me start with the significance of financial evaluation 
Effectiveness of any managerial function is assessed
ultimately based on its financial outcome 
In this sense understanding the dynamics of supply chain design
and its contribution towards financial outcome is very significant 
Providing high quality services at lowest possible input cost
Welcome you all to the lesson on
as a requirement of any functional management in today's scenario 
Financial implications of supply chain design 
Supply chain design is the outcome of supply chain decisions
viz , supply chain strategy,
planning and supply chain operations 
All these components have a literal impact on
financial outcome either in the manner of leveraging uncertainty,
cost reduction or in optimum utilization of resources 
Supply chain design determines
significant investments in supply chain such as:
financial evaluation of supply chain decisions 
Establishment of channels,
acquire or lease required warehouses,
purchase or lease transportation vehicles and so on 
The decision on acquiring long term assets
have long term financial implications
on the firm termed as capital budgeting decisions 
Evaluation of capital budgeting decisions in supply chain
should consider various uncertainties such as:
Demand fluctuations, exchange rate fluctuations,
political and legal influences,
I would be presenting the lesson on three videos 
economic dynamism at domestic and international level 
These factors have a significant impact on
cash inflow of any project 
An in-depth evaluation of cash flow analysis is essential 
Determination of cash flows 
In evaluating the cash flow alternatives
widely prevalent method is to determine incremental cash flow
which analyses the differences in cash outflow and inflow due
to the decision considered 
Incremental after tax cash inflow with relevant cash outflows
Learning objectives of this module are:
are to be considered 
Further tax effects, effects on other projects,
effect of indirect expenses and effect of depreciation
determines the cash flow of the decision 
Discounted cash flow analysis:
Supply chain decisions have long term effect on firm's cash inflow
and therefore it should be evaluated on series of cash inflows
over the life time of the asset 
Discounted cash inflow analysis is based on the
present value of money concept that is,
Understand the nuances of supply chain design and
a rupee today is more valuable than tomorrow 
The present value of cash flow is found by discounting factor 
If a rupee is invested today
and earn a rate of return k over the next period,
an investment of rupees 1 will result in 1 plus k rupees in
the next period 
An investor may not find the difference
in receiving rupee 1 in the next period,
or rupee 1 by 1 plus k in the current period 
Therefore rupee 1 is discounted in the next period
financial evaluation of supply chain decision
as discounted factor is equal to 1 by 1 plus k 
Considering the rate of return, discount rate,
hurdle rate or opportunity cost, initial cash outflow,
the present value of future cash flows
or cash inflows that is C1 to Ct over the subsequent periods
and a rate of return k, Salvage value and working capital recovery
at the end of the period
the NPV on the cash flow stream is given by
<eqn>NPV is equal to t equal to 1 summation n
C1 by 1 plus k to the power of n plus salvage value of  nth  period
with capital budgeting technique,
and working capital recovery at the end of the period
divided by one plus k to the power of n minus cash outflow
at the initial period </eqn>
Illustration to evaluate a supply chain decision of
replacing a warehouse 
Consider hypothetical company, which is in the process of establishing
a new warehouse since the existing warehouse
has its own constraints and the firm wants
to expand its supply chain operations 
The existing warehouse channel
discern supply chain strategy and its impact on cost,
Dear learners! Welcome you all to the module on pricing and
system results in creation of fixed cost  For example, a
retail store with its established resources should increase
various brands and product varieties to use its store space
and customer network efficiently 
Performance tracking is the base for managerial control  The firm
should know the critical success factors in its supply chain and
should leverage it efficiently through prompt response to
customers queries  For example, for high end industrial
machineries and even for any consumer electronic products
after sales service is the critical success factor 
costing to price individual customers  In this video, let us
Cost reduction is thus an inevitable area in pricing and
revenue management in supply chain management  By identifying
the operational intricacies and critical success factors to
match customers requirements would aid in establishing
competent pricing and proficient revenue management system  With
this note on scope for cost reduction in supply chain, let
me move on to the discussion on value added and non value
added activities in supply chain pricing and revenue management
in the next video 
analyze the aspects of cost savings for pricing
and revenue management in supply chain  Let me move on to the
introduction 
Revenue management is a crucial area where every firm should be
more vigilant to keep the company in a safest position  It
is a complex term to think practically to overcome the
bottle necks for efficient execution of operations  Any
revenue management model ultimately aims to maximise
profit  Fundamentally, profit is determined by revenue & cost
revenue management in supply chain  I would be presenting this
and revenue is based on selling price per unit and volume  So
eventually a firm can fetch more profit logically under two
situations: Utilizing the price advantage when the demand
conditions are favorable, saving more by controlling cost which
means cost competitiveness  In the long run it is more logical
to concentrate on costing and pricing in revenue management 
Cost savings is the crux of pricing and revenue management
in any industry  There is wider scope for cost reduction due
to the presence of long stream of components in logistics value
chain  Depth refers to the operational intricacies in the
module in three videos 
supply chain components  Every industry is unique and the ways
to cut cost will differ  Operational understanding of the
supply chain will help in identifying the areas of cost
reduction  Let us see few examples of certain industries 
Textile: Textile industry is highly affected by cotton price 
Price fluctuations in cotton price provides scope for cost
savings through proper inventory management and procurement at
right time  Aviation industry: Aviation industry generates
revenue with passenger traffic and goods transportation and
affected by seasonality  Distribution of service with
Learning objectives of this module are: Understand the scope
mutual promotional pricing serves better resource
utilization and reduced procurement cost through fuel
hedging and contractual purchase of material needs of support
services which aid and saves costs  Retail stores:
Super markets and retail stores partake cost reduction in areas
of vendor and inventory management and better customer
service through home delivery  Time management in procurement,
ordering time efficiency, and delivery time is aspects which
reduces cost and brings value addition to customers  The
overriding fact in all the industries is the understanding
for cost reduction in supply chain revenue management,
of the dynamism and operational intricacies in cost reduction 
Let us see how systematic approach would support cost
reduction in supply chain 
Identification of product and service requirement of the
customers is the predominant factor in service enhancement 
Understand what adds value to the customer and avoid the non
value added product or services in the supply chain  For
example
mixer shall exempted to reduce cost and price of the product 
The delivery system shall provide the customer in choosing
identify the areas of non value added cost, application of ABC
required size and type of jar in the product bundle 
Strategies are supportive diplomacies for vision and
objectives of the organisation and determines the tactics  In
outlining the strategies for tactical planning an
understanding of the requirement of the customer is crucial 
There are certain areas to clung on it: Map the operations in
each component of supply chain, identify the causes and resource
deficiencies for the problem, analyse the gap in customer
requirements, solve the problems relating the gap and problems 
For example: Timely delivery to remote places may be the
costing in pricing and revenue management  Learning outcomes  At
identified problem and the firm should approach strategically to
collaborate for distribution with other corporates ensuring
that it will not affect its competitive edge 
Operational conceptualization will give a clear picture on
interdependencies and dependencies of tasks  This
would help in identifying the bottlenecks and to predetermine

unavoidable in airline industry due to natural calamities and
unforeseen problems  Collaborative strategies with

The added cost for such problems will give more benefit
by way of customer satisfaction and retaining the reputation 
Network management is essential especially to match supply and

Outsourcing and efficient vendor management is the
success platform in supply chain management  In the scenario of
product diversification and customisation vendor
management demands more focus to satisfy the customers varied
needs at less cost  For example, Walmart has well

Dear learners from the previous video you would have understood
in reengineering in the supply chain activities and processes
and this will result in cost reduction and competitive
pricing  A simple exercise for you to understand non-value
added activities in cost reduction would help for better
understanding  Imagine you're going for shopping for your
birthday party, identifying six activities and sketch the
process of the activities, identify two non value added

customers, irrespective of any industry and activity can be
classified as either value added activity or non-value added
activity from the perspective of customers  Value-added and non-
value added activities  The activities or steps which adds
value to the functionality of the product or service or
business or customers is value added activities and the activities
or steps which does not add value to the product or service
functionality, business or customers and simply adds
cost and delays time is non- value added activity 
Customer orientation: The management mantra of either giant
how cost saving aid pricing and revenue management  In this
corporate or small business firm is customer is the king 
So, anything that does not add value is considered to be a
waste  Resource management: The purpose of identification of
value added and non-value added activities is to eliminate wastage 
Resource management focuses on utilization for best alternative
purposes  So, any resource spent for non value added activity is
mere waste since the resources would be limited  Further, this
will increase the cost and price  Market structure and
competitive pricing  In the scenario of monopoly
competition, a firm may not focus on elimination of non-
video on value added and non- value added activities in
value added activity since the firm is a price maker and not
price taker in the market  Most of the firms in the present
economic system are not in a monopoly setup other than
government owned sectors  Firms are facing intensive price
competition and therefore, it is very essential to streamline and
eliminate non value added activities to have control on
cost for competitive pricing  Competitive pricing is the most
appropriate method to win strategically  Profit maximisation:
A firm's ultimate short term goal is to maximise profit  When
a firm wants to maximize profit it should use the resources for
pricing and revenue management, we will discuss the significance
profitable purposes and eliminate cost  The product
which provides maximum contribution per unit should be
given priority in production  If resources are utilized for
product with less contribution margin there will be an
opportunity loss to the firm 
Let us see the possibilities of competitive pricing through
elimination of non value added activities  Lean process and
thinking can help the management to identify the ways to eliminate
the non-value added activities  Lean the supply chain in an
organization for the changes that is required to move on with
of identification of value added and non-value added activities,
the phase of dynamism  The possible areas of elimination
or transportation  In most of the industries the major
proportion of non-value adding cost is transportation cost 
This is an area where every firm has the scope for cost reduction 
It is an essential activity which does not add value to the
customers  To overcome the effect of such costs firms can
establish collaborative partners for distribution to share the
transportation resources among them  Inventory Management:
Inventories such as raw material, work in process, and
finished products require unnecessary activities when
its causes and consequences on pricing and revenue management 
stocked beyond limit and it adds cost in terms of maintenance and
capital investment  Proper vendor management, automisation,
and just in time manufacturing will eliminate the non-value
added activities associated with inventory management  Warehouse
location: Warehouse at right location reduces unnecessary
movement of goods to different shopping outlets  This needs
statistical analysis to identify location points
focusing on active shopping centers  This would avoid
frequent transportation, over stocking, under stocking,
unnecessary investment in warehousing etc  Waiting time:
Let me start with an introduction to what is value in
Waiting time in production and in meeting the delivery schdule
due to bottlenecks in the system adds unnecessary
extra cost in overcoming the expedited time by way of spending
more for quick packaging, extra cost for quick transportation
arrangements etc  Over production: Over production of the products
without considering the demand in the product line leads to
loss of profit  The failed product would eat away the
profit of successful product due to overstocking cost  Over-
processing or over servicing: Over processing or over servicing for
unnecessary accuracy is a non value added activity which would
the present context?
lead to increase in cost and price  Over servicing will
lead to more waiting time in the queue for the customers and will
lead to dropping of customers  Defects: Defective items add non
value added activities in supply chain such as rectification,
buy back management, loss of reputation etc  This will lead
to reduction in revenue  The negative implications of non-
elimination of non-value added activities can be summarized as:
Products which are difficult to produce will have high profit
margin, a product that has to be dropped may show high profit in
the product bundle, competitor product will show a
From the perspective of management notes as, anything
significantly lesser price, company will lose bids for
simple products which has high profit and will fetch bids for
complicated and low profit products due to irrelevant
pricing  It will be difficult to retain the customers and enhance
market share since resources are wasted for non-value added
activities 
I would like to conclude this lesson saying that
identification of value-added activities and non-value added
activities is a significant task in establishing an efficient
supply chain  Elimination of non- value added activities would help

Tracing the direct cost to the final product or service is
simple and both the methods directly traces the direct cost

traditional costing and ABC costing  In conventional
costing, overhead cost allocation is volume based or

material, indirect labour are allocated using a base such as
labour hours and machine hours  In activity based costing,
indirect costs are allocated using activity cost drivers  For
example, transport equipment costs are allocated from the
material handling cost pool using number of parts handled,

In the present illustration, we can see the cases sold at
different prices to the customers A, B, C, D and E, and
the number of purchase orders for each customer is given in

number of deliveries to each customer and the number of
kilometers travelled per month for each customer and number of
Cost of individual activities are calculated and assigned to
expedited deliveries to each customer is given  Based on the
activities: Activity cost driver is identified by the retail
store  The activities undertaken are: Order taking, customer visits,
deliveries, product handling and expedited deliveries  The cost
driver rate are calculated appropriately and it is
determined to be rupees 750 per purchase order, rupees 600 per
customer visit, rupees 5 75 per delivery kilometer travelled, rupees
3 75 per bottle sold, and rupees 2 25 per expedited delivery  The
customer level operating income of each of the five retail
customers are calculated individually  The present
each product or service on the basis of activities required to
analysis sales revenue per month for each customer is calculated
by
multiplying the selling price per unit with the respect to volume
of units that is sold to each customer  With this, the
costs are deducted to calculate the total income for each
customer  The cost includes the cost of each case that is bought
by the retail store and other operating costs are order taking
cost, cost of customer visits, delivery cost, product handling
cost, expedited delivery costs  The costs are consolidated to
find the total income for each customer and the income per

be 15 028 rupees for customer A, 15 078 rupees for customer B,
rupees 8 797 for customer C, 14 107 rupees for customer D,
and rupees 3 99 for customer E  In the above analysis customers
are evaluated based on the activity cost drivers namely
order taking cost, customer visit cost, delivery cost,

source  It provides working capital leverage if the cash
cycles are shortened through proper sales management  There
are various means to manage pricing for perishable goods
and let me discuss some of them  Techniques of pricing and
revenue management for perishable goods  Rapidity of
supply chain for perishable goods increases revenue and
profit  A perishable product is one which has shortest self- life 
Firm's ability to shorten the time required to bring the
products at sale point is the root for success  This would
maintain the goods fresh by quick loading and unloading,
pricing for multiple customer segments  In this video, we will
efficient transportation system, lesser waiting time in the dock,
cold management system etc  The bottlenecks in the
touch points of supply chain should be reduced so that the
self-life of the product shall be increased  The time required
to convert goods to cash decreases by quickening the
velocity of supply chain  The firm's investment from the time
of ordering, bringing to the sale point and making it a real sale
has interest cost and further the self-time of the product
decreases the wastage and this increases the profit margin 
Further, this would enhance the revenue through maximizing the
discuss on: Techniques of pricing and revenue management for
pre frequency of goods converted into cash that is turnover 
Prioritise based on self-life and price  The self-life of
goods has vital role in pricing the goods for example,
if a product has a self-life of 20 days, the first 10 days are
utilized in transportation and the product is ready for sale,
from 11th day in the retail shop, it should price
differently for different stages of its self-life  It should price
high keeping the probability of wastage of the product due to
its perishability and profit margin, say till the 15th day of the
self- life  Does retail shops should price less from the 18th
perishable goods, pricing and revenue management for seasonal
day to 20th day to push the products? The frequency of time
based pricing may depend on the forecasted demand within the
self- life  Multi point regional procurement  Multi point
regional procurement would reduce the perishability of the
products since it procures for its retail chain from the nearby
locality especially regionally available and abundant products 
The procurement strategy should be in a such a way that only the
most demanded and unavailable products are procured from far
which would reduce transportation cost,
refrigeration cost, and wastage costs and enhance value addition
products  Let me move on to the significance of perishable
to the customers through quality maintenance  Dynamic pricing 
Dynamic pricing refers to variable pricing where the firm
considers various factors  In perishable goods the firm
categorizes a good based on various factors and price
instead of a single price  For example, a flower vendor may
price differently consedring the auspicious days since the
flowers are highly demanded on those days  Further utility
requirements and timing also influence price discrimination
and the flowers are priced differently during evening hours
and morning hours  With a note on pricing for perishable goods
commodities in retailing  Perishable commodities play a
let me move on to pricing for seasonal products  What is a
seasonal product? A seasonal product follows a set pattern of
expenditure in the customers calendar which may be
influenced by: Climatic requirement, religious
requirements such as festivals, professional requirement, tour
seasons etc  Population with diversified culture are
influenced much with festivals and retailers usually follow
varied promotion strategies to boost their sales during these
seasons  It is a cumbersome and interesting area to understand
and execute pricing policy for seasonal products  Let me
vital role in retail market since it is a major revenue and
discuss few points to be considered in pricing seasonal
products  Inventory optimization  Inventory
optimization in seasonal products refers to trade-off
between overstocking cost and understocking cost 
Overstocking may lead to dumping of investment and understocking
may lead to loss of demand  Overstocking results in cost
hike and reduction of profit and understocking will lead to loss
of customers and revenue  Both has an impact on
pricing in the long run as cost influences price and under
stocking impacts volume of sales and pricing  Pricing to promote 
profit generating area  Appropriate inventory management
Pricing less to promote for the products during seasons is a
strategy that has been used to compete with the competitors 
This strategy is used to attract customers since the demand is in
peak during the seasons and revenue maximization through
demand creation via low pricing is tranquil  Quantity discounts 
Pricing the products to sale out the old stocks during seasonal
demand for garments and vehicles is a technique to increase
revenue and capitalize inventory  Buy one get one free is a common
discount strategy that is followed by garment shops and in
other fancy accessory shops  Wholesale price index  Wholesale
with proper supply chain and sales support would make the
price index is also a measure to price the seasonal products as
wholesale price index gives the variations in the goods price
till they reach the customers  It is a pricing method which is
based on supply of goods  Producer's price index is also
another index measured in USA  Such indices help to systemize
the pricing methodology of seasonal products based on
supply and demand  Conclusion: Pricing for perishable and
seasonal products is more dynamic since there is high
level of unpredictability in supply and demand  Yet firms
and retail shops are very aimful in generating lottery

Dear learners! Welcome you all to the module on performance
mechanisms, supply chain performance and control-
throughput dollar days, supply chain performance and control-
inventory dollar days  The learning objectives is to explain
the need for measuring supply chain performance and the
concepts of throughput dollar days and inventory dollar days
as the supply chain performance and control measure  By the end
of this session, the learner will be able to appreciate
Goldratt's approach to supply chain performance and control, apply
throughput and inventory dollar days in setting supply chain
performance measures  Welcome you all to the first lesson on
measurement and controls in supply chain  Measuring supply
supply chain performance measurement and control  Supply
chain management aims to ensure effective flow of materials,
information, and funds across various supply chain partners 
So, what should the supply chain performance measure and control
mechanism? A well-established supply chain performance and
control should provide insights about: Supplier competences,
customer satisfaction, outcomes of supply chain network and
partnership  The supply chain models namely: Supply chain
operations reference model, design-chain operations
reference model, and the customer chain operations
chain performance has many approaches but most are
reference model define the processes for effective supply
chain performance and metrics for performance measurement  The
second most important performance measure is the cost
of supply chains  The application of activity based
costing across the supply chain by all the participants of the
supply chain has led to performance and control of
supply chains  In contemporary supply chain management process,
the performance of supply chain is measured across two key
performance indicators  Timely delivery of products and
services, cost savings due to timely delivery of products and
extremely complex and difficult to implement  Added to this is
services  Control mechanisms  The delivery of products will have
an impact on the cost associated with excess inventory and
extensive lead time  So the three major supply chain control
mechanisms that have been adapted by all the supply chain
partners are: Managing inventory velocity, time compression, and
perfect order  Now, I will present some highlighting points
across the supply chain control mechanisms and its impact on
supply chain performance  Managing inventory velocity:
Inventory is a challenge in supply chain because: Excessive
inventory leads to unproductive investment and obsolescence 
the problem of sharing data on performance across the supply
Inventory shortages lead to delays across the supply chain
and customer dissatisfaction  Inventory velocity is a
control mechanism which will reduce bullwhip effect and
ensure timely supply  Inventory compression is emphasised at
every point of the supply chain  The total cost of excess or
shortage of inventory should be considered across the entire
supply chain  Total inventory dollar days is a metric that can
be deployed for inventory management  Time compression 
Inventory and logistics issues in supply chains result in
longer lead-time and stockout situations  This has emphasized
chain without compromising competitive secrets  Goldratt
the requirement for time compression  Time compression
can be effectively executed by monitoring the cycle time
metrics namely: Order placement to order fulfillment, manufacture
to order completion, on-time customer delivery, order to cash
conversion, outstanding sales days  Throughput dollar days is
a metric that can result in time compression and reduce
blockages across the supply chain  Perfect orders  A firm
receiving the good from its suppliers should be as per the
specification in the orders  Perfect order fulfillment by
suppliers is a beginning of effective supply chain
has come up with much simpler approach to document and assess
performance as it ensures the: Quality of end products and
services, cost savings due to avoidance of delays, longer lead
time and returns  Similarly, perfect order fulfillment to
meet customer expectation is the ultimate measure of the supply
chain performance  This would lead to enhanced customer
satisfaction and reduced reverse logistics issues  With the basic
understanding of performance measurement and control, a small
exercise for you  Identify five performance issues in a supply
chain and suggest a control mechanism for the same  Thank
you and welcome you all for the next two lessons in supply chain

Supply chain performance measurement and control
TDD is also useful in identifying the bottleneck in the entire supply chain 
In our case, if you would note player "B" has a total TDD of
1174, which is another use for this particular calculation is
finding the bottleneck in the entire supply chain 
If you will notice in this particular example, player 'C' has a total TDD
of 2340 lakhs  This means player "C" is the bottleneck, he is
getting delayed the maximum  If the entire supply chain has
to do better, everyone should focus on player "C' 
Can you see how simple this particular calculation was?
But this is only half the story  What about deliveries that come early 
How do you think we can measure the performance of such
We shall see that in the next video 
a vast group of entities, which are all different organizations,
but at the end, they're all working as a network for one final goal 
And why do you think we should be measuring their
performance at all? What's wrong and the current setup for each
one measures his own performance  Let's consider
two different supply chains in the milk industry 
We consider two fictitious companies called Patle Ltd and Kamul 
Which supply chain do you think would be a better choice for supplying milk?
How do you think the supply chains can be measured?
Hi, this is Professor Vivek  I am
What information do you think each person should provide
so that the entire supply chain performance can be tracked?
How do you think the information should be collected and processed?
What do you think will be the complexity of the computations?
Who should be in charge of maintaining the score
of the supply chain? Will it require expensive computing to monitor?
Will it be practical to implement it at all?
Will it upset the competitive advantage of the different players in the supply chain?
Such questions have to be addressed with
measuring the supply chain performance  Supply chain is all
a doctorate in supply chain management  I've been teaching for the last
about measuring flows  Three major flows characterize the
performance in a supply chain  These three flows are material,
information, and money  In some industries flow of people can
also be of interest, especially if it's a service industry like
Disneyland or hospital  Any metric that aims to measure the
performance of supply chain has to focus on these flows 
There are many methods of tracking supply chain performance 
We are going to consider one search method, which stands out for its
ease of application and availability of data 
This was given by an Israeli genius called Eliyahu Goldratt 
22 years and I teach in the Decision Sciences Department at
He suggested two measures the TDD and the IDD 
Goldratt proposed these two measures as a means to measure
any supply chains performance, we will be considering a slight variant of
the original proposition by goldratt, this is for convenience,
the variation works as well as the original proposition 
This video shall consider the first of the
propositions namely TDD  Goldratt used TDD to denote
throughput dollar days  In other words, if a supplier has delayed
his delivery of a certain product, then we lose the
opportunity to sell that product and earn a contribution from it 
PSG Institute of Management  In module one, we are going to be
The price of sale minus the cost of the product is what we
would have earned if the product had come on time  As a result of
this delay, we have lost that earning this is denoted by TDD 
In other countries like India, we can use the term total
value base, because the rupee is the currency here 
This is a measure of the lateness with which a player supplies any
material to his customer  Let us assume,
I have to receive a consignment at 10 o'clock today,
assuming the value of this consignment is 50 lakhs
and it is delayed by three days, the original measure would be only
discussing how you can measure the performance of an entire supply chain 
the number of days the consignment has been delayed 
For Goldratt went on to say and quite rightfully so, that it's
not just the number of days that's delayed, it's also the total value 
Hence, the TDD is computed as the product of the
number of days delayed with the value of the delayed items 
In our case let us assume the consignment is delayed by three
days with a value of 50 lakhs, the total TDD here would be
three days multiplied by the 50 lakhs which is 100 and 50 lakhs 
The same thing will hold good if there is a delay
after 10 days, every single node having a delay should compute
This will enable us to monitor and control the
each and every delay using this same yardstick and noted down 
The values are accumulated towards the end and they are
taken stock of at repeated time intervals  Originally Goldratt
proposed : A value known as throughput, throughput is
computed as the value of a stock minus the totally variable cost 
Here, we are going to neglect the variable costs
and it would work just as well, by talking of the sales value, not
the cost value  Remember, here the value doesn't represent the
cost value its sales value  Here, we are going to have a
look at the flow of value through the supply chain 
working of the whole supply chain as a single unit 
Let's consider a small example  This example talks about three
players in a supply chain A supplies to B and B supplies to C 
If you see day one, "A" is delayed by one day, his supply
to "B" is delayed by one day, the delay in the value is 20 lakhs 
This means the total delay value happens to be 20 lakhs that's the TDD 
Consider player "B" if you take week number 4
he is delayed by 5 days
while the value delay value is 98 lakhs,
here the total delay value will be 98
multiplied by 5 that's 490  If you will note the
Supply Chain: It's a collection of entities which are working together
cumulative delay for player A across the 8 days is 778 lakhs,
the same thing for "C" is 2340 lakhs  Note, we are not
interested in the performance of one single player A or B or C 
We are interested in the collective performance of all the three 
Here, we collectively measure the total TDD for all the three
players put together over the 8 days and this happens to
be 3514 lakhs  Supposing you're considering three
different supply chains, this is a lovely measure to tell you
which supply chain is doing better? Ideally, the total TDD
should be zero  But in practice it's never the case 
to satisfy the needs and wants of the end customer 
chain and we also look at the entire supply chain's performance,
meaning A, B and C put together  For example, on day one, "A" has
a performance score of 164 lakhs  On day three,
the performance score is 460 lakhs  What do the TDD and IDD mean?
Ideally, both the TDD and the IDD should be zero, which
would indicate a perfect delivery by every single player
in the supply chain to their subsequent customers 
We have considered a very simple supply chain  The chain could be
complicated and a huge network, irrespective of that it works
all the same  This is probably the simplest and the most direct
What do you think will happen?
measure of flow among so many methods available in the market 
To institute this measure of TDD and IDD, it is essential that
all the supply chain members agree to make their information public 
There is a certain level of transparency, which is
required, which requires a change in thinking in the managements of
the various players in the supply chain  All they need to
put up, what is the value of the delay they are
enforcing ? and what is the value of the early deliveries they
have been making? If each player in the supply chain maintains
this record and makes it publicly available to all the
50+50 packets, 100 packets will sit in our premises for two days 
other players, then it's extremely simple for the entire
supply chain to find out who is the bottleneck who needs some help 
Whom should you not overload because bottlenecks
overloaded means the entire supply chain it's jammed 
And this is a lovely method of even comparing two supply chains,
especially if a person is a member of two or more supply chains

Remember for these two days, they're not going to be sold 
They're just sitting there  They have absolutely no value for us 
It occupies space, it occupies our attention,
consumes current, in all probability, we will have to be
careful that it doesn't get damaged  This is the impact
of delivering something early  It leads to a buildup of
inventory of stock  It also takes up a lot of space 
Consider what will happen if you have 100 products
Hi, this is Vivek back here again!
instead of just the two? Imagine if each of the 100 products is two days
early, and each has a demand of 50 per day 
What do you think will happen?
5000 products per day, meaning
you have a stock of 10,000 products  Imagine the kind of
space it's going to take up  And imagine for today's sale,
I am using products which have arrived day before yesterday 
What do you think we will do with the stocks that arrive
today, with the stocks that arrived yesterday?
If we do not have sufficient space, it will cause such a confusion
We are going to study the second part of the supply chain
that products might end up getting mixed 
And now imagine if instead of two days,
the products are delivered 10 days in advance 
Can you see the scale of inventory buildup?
Can you see the impact on physical space?
What do you think will happen to your investment in working capital?
Because, and the usual circumstances, all the stocks
are usually hypothecated to the bank meaning, we pay an interest
on the stocks that we hold  The larger the number of stocks, the
larger is the interest to end up paying the banks  Why would you
performance measurement  It's called the "IDD"  Assume we are
want to pay interest on stocks which are not going to be sold
for now, for just holding it in our place for want of delivery timing?
Imagine, what would happen if the demand changes from 50 to 5000 each?
This is a humongous problem 
Can you see the kind of problems early delivery has caused?
Consider car rally, let's say a 'Himalayan car rally' 
How do you think the participants are rated?
Let us assume a participant has to reach destination A at 5 p m 
If he arrives at 5:10 p m that's 10 minutes late 
He is penalized for 10 points 
dealing in two kinds of milk products, a tetra pack of plain
But if he arrives 2 minutes early, let us say
4:58  He is penalized by 2*10, 20 points because, they
penalize early reaching 10 times more seriously than coming late 
Can you see why early delivery is such a serious offense?
Every supply chain works this way 
Early delivery upsets the flow, it clogs up the supply chain, it causes payment
delays and money flow problems also 
Taiichi Ohno one said the worst among the seven wastes was overproduction 
This hasn't been understood properly by anyone Taiichi
Ohno did not talk about the numbers  Taiichi Ohno was always talking of flow 
milk and another half flavored milk  For convenience, let us
What he meant was, "if some player is working faster
than the others meaning, he finishes something quickly and
deliver something early, it leads to a lot of problems" 
Taiichi Ohno is on record saying all the other wastes are caused by this one
single waste called overproduction  What he meant
was, if one of the players is so quick that he consistently
delivers early to the other players, he is going to cause a
lot of waste across the network  Consider a movie, Ten of you
want to go for the movie, the movie happens to be at 3
o'clock and you reach at 2 o'clock, what happens? All of you
assume we are dealing in one flavour say vanilla 
have to sit and wait for one hour  Pretty much a waste 
On the other hand, consider a bakery  They're expecting a lot
of buns for customers at 4 o'clock  And let's say it
arrives one day early  What happens? It simply sits at stock 
Don't you think this is a waste? Goldratt decided to measure
this and he called it IDD  Any early delivery would mean
inventory accumulates  Just as late delivery makes the facility
wait, early delivery is equally serious  Just like an TDD the
IDD has a similar computation  TDD measured the number of days
delayed  In IDD, we measure the number of days, it's arrived early 
Assume every day we have a constant demand of 50 packets for each product 
This translates into inventory value  In regular
accounting, we would just note down the cost value of the
inventory, but here, we are not looking at the cost, we are
looking at the total sales value, not at the cost 
Goldratt computed the throughput, which removed the total variable cost
from the sales value  However, we will stick to the value
because it conveys a similar message  Have a look at our example 
This is similar the same supplying chain "A" supplying to
"B" and "b" supplying to "C"  On the first day A has an early
arrival of, well, five days and the total value is 25 lakhs 
Assume the supplier supplies both two days in
How much do you think would be the total value of the inventory?
Well, hundred and twenty five lakhs  consider B on the second day
B arrives two days early and has a total value of 15 lakhs 
This translates to total inventory value of 30 lakhs 
Here, you see it's not just the number of days the inventory sitting,
it incorporates the value as well  Original accounting would take
only the number of days  Here, we take the value that's why
it's called inventory dollar days  For non-dollar currencies,
we would call it "inventory value days"  Just like anTDD the IDD
values are also accumulated for each single player on the supply
advance, meaning for today's demand he has supplied day before yesterday 
one of the players  All three can cause serious problems in the supply chain 
They have very serious implications on the
material flow and the money flow as well  While it's extremely
difficult to standardize the information flow across the
supply chain because each organization has his own kind of
information policy and his own kind of software 
We still can come and have a common platform where the flow of information
among partners is standardized, and the frequency and the
protocols are seriously discussed together  Each person
should not assume what other person thinks is the right information 
What are the various risks associated in supply chain flows?
If You will note point number one, namely standardizing
the information has a huge impact on creating a proper
information disruption policy  Information disruption policy
has no standard mechanism, but then all players can sit
together and always evolve a disruption policy 
This particular module has been created so that all of you can
identify disruptions and also identify strategies to deal with
the disruptions in supply chain flows 
The next kind of disruption is money flow disruption 
Money is probably the most important flow in business, although material flow
We studied in module one that supply chain has three kinds of
is highly evident  What happens if somebody pays
somebody late? Or what happens if somebody defaults on a
payment? Or what happens if a mistaken amount is credited to wrong player?
All these cause a lot of irritation, frustration,
much more than either the material flow or the information flow 
Because people are more serious about money 
Money flow disruptions happen because different players play
according to different rules  They have differing credit
periods, they have differing methods of payment, they have
differing sources of finance, their financial health may be
flows major ones that is material flow, information flow,
different, and also their business compulsions may be different 
The most serious problem, however, could be the
business economic cycles  During recessions, money flow has a
huge squeeze, which means all the players are hard pressed to pay 
This is not as serious as when a certain set of players
in the entire supply chain are squeezed  The rest of the supply
chain suffers due to small problems within a few players 
How do you think we should deal with money flow disruptions?
There are three important points although there are no general rules 
Point number one, it's extremely important that every
and money flow  Material flow is the most gross among the
single player maintain a standard payment schedule
and a standard credit schedule  More than the credit period, it's the
variation and the credit period or the payment schedules that
upsets the rest of the players in the supply chain 
A small variation on one player can cause huge problems with all the other players 
The next point is to have adequate cash stocks or cash reserves 
When each player has forecast his money
requirements correctly, it's extremely simple to manage the
entire cash flow  The whole problem starts when somebody has
underestimated his cash requirement or is suddenly
flows, the other two flows are a little abstract and so, we
experiencing a cash squeeze where he has to default or
suddenly has to take a loan at an exorbitant rate of interest 
All the things cause a ripple across the entire supply chain,
not just a player experiencing it  And the third point, which
is equally important is the government policy on credit and payment,
though it looks like a silly point, this influences entire
supply chains and small governmental policy changes,
like credit period or requirement of online tracking
or a sudden change in the technology which the government
mandates as required, for example, the GST can have huge
shall consider the abstract flows first before moving on to the material flow 
implications across different supply chains

Supply chain risks has many- many connotations but in this module,
we are going to confine ourselves to the disruptions to the flow 
Consider a dairy supply chain 
Dear learners! Welcome to the module on supply chain risk 
We will go backwards, we start with a customer,
you or me, we go to the department store and buy some milk 
We are supplied by a retailer who has collected the milk 
Let's assume this retailer directly gets it from
the dairy farmer, what he in turn supplies it 
This dairy farmer in turn has to buy cattle feed and a number of other
inputs for his cows  And this supply chain, what happens if
the department store which gives you a milk  is on  strike a day 
You don't get your milk or what happens for the feed supplier is
not able to get the feed to the dairy farmer  The cows going to starve 
This module covers two sessions  Session one talks about
What happens if the retailer goes and tells the cow owner,
please give me 100 litres of milk and he doesn't get the information 
What happens if the dairy farmer forgets to pay the
feed supplier all these are called disruptions 
They constitute the three kinds of disruptions we had mentioned,
namely material flow disruption, money flow disruption,
and information flow disruption 
Imagine in this particular case,
you want the information about the milk being delivered or not
being delivered, or changing the quantity of delivery to reach
information and money flow risk  Session two talks about material flow risk 
the customer well in advance  What do you think you can do
to make such information reach? Do you think you can have it done?
Or you want the distributor to tell the milk man the milk is
consistently getting spoiled or the milk last for only two hours
instead of five hours like previously or if his packaging
is not good enough and he is not able to maintain the same
quality when he gives it to the customer or the customer is
pointing fingers at the quality of the milk that is coming on 
How do you think the distributor should engage the milkman
or the distributor wants to get to know how the customer actually
Learning objectives: One, get a grasp of information
buys the milk  In other words, what is his demand pattern?
When does he buy extra milk or when does he say no milk for today 
Is it possible for the customer to decide in advance that he is
going to buy extra milk or no milk and if so, can the distributor
get access to this kind of information 
Do you think the customer will think it is private and he is not going to
share it with others or can the customer be convinced that if he shares it
he is likely to get a better service 
If the distributor gets this information, do you think he can
coordinate with the milkman and say
and money flow in a supply chain, two, explain how to deal with
this is his pattern  Can you milk more or can you milk less,
all these things, do you think you can have it achieved 
Let's change focus  Assume the milk delivery is going on fine 
The information from the customers coming perfectly,
there is no milk which is over delivered or under delivered,
but, the customer doesn't pay on time  Customer doesn't care or
he defaults on a payment  Customer is missing when the
payment has to be collected  How do you think it's going to
impact the rest of the players? How do you think the distributor
is going to pay the salaries for his workers? If the customer
material flow disruptions  Learning outcomes: At the end of
hasn't given the money  How do you think the distributor is
going to pay the milk man? Is he going to end up borrowing money
from the bank or from some third party? To make sure that he
meets all his expenses on time  Or does he default to players
like the milkman? And if the milkman is defaulted on, do you
thing he can buy feed for the cows on time? Can you see the
impact of irregular money flow? Or on the other hand, the customer
may not default that he pays very irregularly sometimes once
a month, in a week, sometimes once in 15 days  Sometimes he
doesn't pay for three months and then suddenly pays everything 
this session the students should be able to, one, identify strategies
It   It leads to a spike in money flow suddenly, whereas the
demand and the flow of the materials and information has
been normalized  If money flow is going to have spikes,
it's going to have an impact on how each of the players
deals with their cash outflows  Why?
Because the inflow is not stable 
Can you stabilize this in any way?
Do you think you could stabilize it
at the individual player level 
Or do you think a lot of players have to get together and have to decide this 
to deal with information and money flow disruptions,
Can you find out the root cause? What's going around?
In any supply chain, you will have potential players who
default on payments or have extremely irregular payment cycles 
How are you going to deal with this players? Can you insulate
the other players in the chain from such irregular players?
Information flow disruption, Information flow can have three
kinds of problems  Problem number one, information just
doesn't reach, there is a break in the information flow 
Problem number two, wrong information reaches the wrong person 
Problem number three, too much of information overloading any
two, identify strategies to deal with material flow disruptions 
into three equal parts, each part from the top to the bottom,
follow the order of green, yellow and red  Buffer resizing
is done once in 60 days  If you resize very often, everybody
gets confused in the supply chain  At the end of 60
days, if a bulk of the stock has been in the green zone meaning
the top part it means your buffer is too big, if a bulk of
your buffer is in the red zone, it means your buffer is too small 
It needs resizing  Goldratt gave a very simple rule
if your buffer is too big, reduce it by 33%  If your buffer
is too small, increase it by 33%  However, we can follow a
supply chain example  What do you think would happen if the
slightly more scientific methodology and find out what's
the lead time and what's the demand? After all, buffer size is
determined by these two changes in lead time and changes in demand 
Over the 60 days, if you find out the peak lead time
and peak demand and resize the buffer, presto! you have the
right buffer size  Here is an exercise for all of you 
Assume you have a department store next to your house
and you pass on information  At certain times,
he is out of stock, he is not able to supply
the materials you want, say a bar of soap,
farmer is not able to deliver the milk to the retailer because
or maybe some rice or some other provisions 
How would you suggest that he maintain stock
to supply whatever you want whenever you wanted ?
How do you think the information you passed
should be recorded by him so that he doesn't get any
miscommunication or he doesn't forget? How do you think he
should standardize the payments you make to him?
Use the principles you have learnt to come up with an answer 
of a transport strike  Or what do you think would happen if his
cows suddenly start giving only 50% of the milk they
normally give? What do you think would happen if all the milk
reaches the retailer but, there is a retailer strike as a result
of which, much of the milk gets spoiled in the stores?
All this is an example of material disruption  How do you think we
could handle material disruptions? The three methods of
doing it, method number one, we need to maintain a safety stock
The last video we discussed two important problems in supply
and a decoupling stock  In each player of the supply chain has a
certain minimum stock, which offsets the variation in
material flow across the supply chain due to differing
capacities of different players to handle differing amounts of material 
The second method of dealing with this is to have a
proper and an accurate forecasting methods 
While this is easier said than done, because most players have no
clue as to the demand pattern of his customer  The third method
is to use a pull system that Toyota called the Kanban 
Kanban is a lovely method to eliminate variations in demand patterns 
chain flows namely, information and money  Today, we're going to
But apart from Toyota and a few other companies, very few have
successfully implemented the Kanban pull production  There
must be some other method where we could achieve the same
material consistency in flow  This is where we bring in Goldratt
again  Goldratt's proposed a lovely method known as replenishment 
In his replenishment, he created a method
that is both self-regulating and requires very
little computation  Also, if every player in the supply chain
follows the replenishment model, there is very little
communication that they need from the other players to be
consider a far more complex flow namely, the material flow across
able to function and manage their material stock 
Goldratt proposed three rules in his replenishment policy 
Rule number one, is the ordering policy  In the ordering policy,
it's extremely simple  Let us say you have the same players in
the dairy supply chain  Let us assume the retailer is
ordering for 100 litres of milk to the dairy farmer 
Today, the dairy farmer supplies 100 litres of milk,
so tomorrow, he should milk only 100 litres 
Anything extra is not done here 
On day two, the farmer milks 100 litres of milk but, the retailer
the supply chain  in supply chain we have a famous punch line
asks only for 80 litres of milk  What happens the farmer has
a stock of 20 litres of milk  On day three, supposing the
retailer asks for 110 litres of milk  The farmer already has
how many? 20 litres  He is going to milk only as much as he has
supplied on day one  Simple isn't it  When the farmer is
milking only as much as he supplies to the customer,
there is going to be a certain mismatch in the supply given to the customer 
This is maintained by the second rule 
What characterizes the ordering policy is frequent ordering,
preferably every single day  There are certain people who
"Supply chain is supposed to replace inventory with information" 
order every three hours or even every hour 
The faster the ordering is done, the more accurate is going to be
the material flow across the system  put it in simple
words whatever goes out is the same amount that a player orders
from his supplier  What happens if there is a variation in demand?
This will definitely mean that the supplier has to
make up for the difference in the stock  For example, today
the customer orders for 100 litres of milk, so the farmer tomorrow
milks exactly 100 litres of milk  What happens if the next
day the customer orders for 120? 20 litres less?
It's easier said than done  In spite of all the
How do you make up for this?
This is where Goldratt's gave his second rule,
the rule of maintaining a buffer  This is probably the
easiest computation of buffer across so many inventory models
available across the operations management spectrum 
The buffer is meant to absorb variations in demand from the customer side 
These variations are impossible to predict because they're
highly random unless, both the customer and the supplier decide
to have a certain standard variation  This doesn't happen 
Goldratt's buffer is computed using three variables F, L&D
advances in information technology, in spite of all the
"F" stands for the ordering frequency, "L" stands for the lead
time, and "D" stands for the demand  The formula is the
demand multiplied by the sum of the lead time and the ordering frequency 
Ordering frequency could be every day, it
could be every month or it could be once in three months
but, here we maintain a steady ordering frequency  We don't
order in irregular intervals the lead time should be as low as possible 
But what happens when you have a variable lead time?
We assume that the largest lead time is used in this formula to
compute the buffer size  The same goes for the demand 
advances in electronic payments, material flow still remains the
The largest demand goes into this formula  When the demand is
steady and the lead time is steady, it's extremely simple to
predict the buffer size  Here too, we have simplified the
entire process by using the largest lead time or the largest demand 
We come to rule number three, buffer resizing 
A buffer is fine, but are we having the right buffer size 
Is it too big Is it too small? Here's where goldratt gave his
third rule of "zones of a buffer"  He divided the buffer into three zones 
The green, the yellow, and the red  These three do not
require complicated mathematics  Just take the buffer and divided
Achilles heel of supply chains  Consider the same dairy
Dear learners! Welcome to this module on E-business processes for a
for supply chain  Supply chain maturity framework 
Consider a supply chain dealing with soaps 
Let's assume a retailer has ordered
for ABC brand of soap, 20 cases along with 30 other brands of soap 
ABC brand alone doesn't arrive and you have a customer
walking in and asking for ABC brand of soap, Problems!
Let's consider another case 
The retailer has 20 cases of another brand of soap 
Let's call it XYZ  This brand of soap is not selling at all 
It's sitting on your shelf and you can do nothing about it 
seamless supply chain  Integrating various players in a
You can't use the shelf for anything else 
Let's consider another example 
Assume there is a brand called PQR, the customer consistently
complains that the PQR has quality issues but, this
information does not reach the manufacturer  Yes, no idea 
But the customer is complaining about quality 
We have seen three problems 
Why do you think these problems happen?
Are they supply chain problems? Or can they just be written away?
Let's consider another case 
supply chain into a single functioning unit is a big
The factory of soap brand XYZ
dispatches the soap to the retailer 
The transport breaks down on the way 
Soap does not arrive at the retailer spot 
This is because of heavy rains which have damaged roads 
You think you have a problem here?
Let's consider another case 
A factory has shut down on account of workers strike 
They stopped manufacturing for weeks at a stretch 
There is a huge demand for the soap at the retailers end
challenge to meet for most supply chains  Here, we take a
but, stocks are just not coming  Will it be possible for the retailer to
contact other stockist or other transportation people to supply
these extra stocks on time  What kind of information do you think
is essential to deal with the problems mentioned? How do you think you
can achieve the task of giving the customer precisely the brand
of soap that he wants? What should be the attitude of
various players, could be the transportation, could be the
factory, could be the retailer? How should they behave with each
other so that the final customer is served with the product he or she wants?
Do you think it's possible for the players to collaborate at all?
look at how this might be achieved using a standard approach?
What are the benefits of having such an
initiative among all the players that they collaborate with one
another? All the problems discussed are because of a lack
of collaboration and integration between the various players in the supply chain 
The lack of coordination leads to different
players in the supply chain taking different kinds of
decisions totally out of sync with each other 
As a result, the voice of the final customer is
drowned somewhere along the way as it moves upwards
towards the upstream players in the supply chain 
Learning objectives: Understand the supply chain maturity framework,
This kind of problem, this kind of problem
leads to all kinds of wrong information flows, wrong
stocking, excess delays, wrong products being shipped and what not?
This initiative that is taken to bind all the players in
the supply chain into one single working unit is known as
external integration in the supply chain 
External integration, though extremely simple to understand
and conceive, has been extremely difficult for most modern supply
chains to achieve  We hardly have any supply chain out there
which is fully externally integrated  Most of the firms
explain external integration strategies in the supply chain 
which are working on supply chain integration in India and
the world over have achieved only internal integration 
We are still way off the mark when it comes to external integration 
This includes some of the leading brands of soaps,
consumer goods, FMCG industries and what not  Can you believe it?
Some of these firms who have invested billions of dollars in
supply chain integration are yet to achieve results in getting a
properly integrated supply chain on the external front?
Very few players have managed to crack the external integration barrier 
One such firm happens to be Toyota Motor Corporation 
Learning outcomes: At the end of this session, the student
It's one of the rare auto companies, which does not push or dump vehicles
on to the dealers and distributors  It works on a
perfect pull and this has been accomplished because of great
deal of external supply chain integration  None of the other
auto companies in India have been able to achieve such a high
degree of external supply chain integration  We have considered
some problems in supply chain because of integration issues 
What kind of information do you think is required to deal
with this situation? What is the infrastructure required
if we are to sort out these problems?
should be able to, one, adapt supply chain maturity framework to real life
What do you think the various players should have as an attitude
if we had to deal with this problem collectively?
Do you think it's possible to get all the players to
collaborate with one another in spite of differing attitudes,
differing goals, differing priorities and differing problems?
Do you think they are going to accept talking to
each other or do you think each one is going to set a few of
their problems on the back burner so that the overall supply chain is benefitted?
What do you think will be the benefits of getting
all the players to collaborate in the first place?
supply chains, to identify external integration strategies
Welcome to the second session on external integration strategies for supply chains 
is publicly available to all the players in the supply chain 
What we're trying to do here is improve the visibility of the
performance parameters of each single player in the supply chain 
This voluntary sharing of information is vital if
the supply chain integration is to happen at all  And lastly,
improve the flow of information among the partners  There are two
issues with this: Issue number one, the right information is
not reaching the right player or issue number two, too much of
information is getting dumped on certain players, too much of
information is as good as no information at all 
Do we need to integrate all the
Each and every player should consciously decide, how much information
should I give? Where should I give? To whom should I give? So
that the integration efforts are achieved  When this kind of an
initiative, the four of them are done over a period of time
with constant effort to deal with any problems which may happen,
by the way, they keep happening all the time 
The supply chain soon becomes externally integrated 
This is what Toyota has done for the last 40 years 
It has taken them that long to have external integration 
processes or is it sufficient if we integrate a few critical and vital processes?
The good news, we do have a standard
procedure to achieve external integration 
This has been proposed as a model  The model is known as
supply chain maturity reference model  This model was proposed
by McCormack in his lovely publication on supply chain maturity 
McCormack classified maturity into five stages 
This is a lovely measure of Agreation , stage is called
Ad hoc, absolutely no processes  There is no definition of what's
How are we to achieve external supply chain integration?
going on anywhere  Stage one, people start making definitions
processes are defined but, there's hardly any connection
between the processes  Stage number three, the supply chain
is linked meaning the firm starts connecting to their
suppliers and to their customers but, predominantly the
various departments within they are connected 
Stage number four, the firm is finally integrated with its supplier
and its customer and stage number five, standard supply chain 
It's in this particular stage that all the players in the supply
chain finally get connected, usually using the cloud as a base 
What efforts do you think we need to put in to achieve it?
In the supply chain maturity reference model  Level one, talks
about totally disintegrated supply chain, it has no
coordination anywhere  We hardly find a supply chain like that
today, most firms have some degree of integration 
Level two, and level three  They talk about the internal integration of the
supply chain  It's useless to talk about external integration,
if internal integration hasn't taken place in the first  In the
supply chain reference maturity model, level one, talks about a
totally disintegrated supply chain  No process talks to any
other process  It's very difficult to get such a supply
What are the areas where we should put in these efforts?
chain in today's world  Most firms have put in a lot of effort
to have at least some degree of integration  Level two and level three,
talk about the internal integration of the supply chain,
meaning different processes inside the firm, source, make,
deliver, return, information, etc  are talking to each other to
some degree at least  This has been a concerted effort which
has been deliberately worked on  This is the foundation for
external integration  External integration is measured in
stages four and five  Stage four, talks about integrating with one
level supplier and one level customer, while stage five tries
Is it possible or is it just a pipe dream? How long do you think you
to bring all the players in the supply chain onto one single page 
A good example of such an integrated supply chain is the
UK dairy industry  This is an amazing industry where they have
integrated everyone ranging from the milkman to the transport to
the retailer, and even the prices have been put online for
everyone to see  We have seen the five levels in a
supply chain maturity  How do we achieve it? Ajmera and cook
have proposed a four-step model phase, we call it the
competitive phase  Each member of the supply chain is striving to
make profits for himself, they don't care about the other person 
should put in these efforts to start seeing tangible results?
Sure, they just negotiate with that partner
where they feel that partner's policies and procedures can
improve their profitability  Much of the supply chain in the
world is like that today  These people are working with
there is no collaboration 
We have purpose such people to phase two  This phase is
called the communication phase  In the communication phase, they
start talking to each other for the first time  With a goal on
improving the overall supply chain and not just their
individual profitability, they are looking at a win-win,
What do you think is a good workable
not that "I win, and I don't care what happens to you" 
The next phase is the cooperative phase  Once they start talking
to each other, they say, "Hey I can help you out somewhere or
you can help me out somewhere"  Why don't we just talk to each
other and try helping each other out  These are the rudimentary
seeds for the next stage, which is called collaboration 
The difference between the cooperative phase and the
collaborative phase is: In cooperative phase, they share a
few resources  In the collaborative phase,
they jointly use the resource and jointly work towards problem
external integration in modern supply chains?
it's just goes far beyond just sharing of resources  Here as
well, the maturity model gives us step-by-step process to
improve integration  Remember, external integration
will happen if and only if each and every player puts in
external integration effort  It cannot be done by just one or
two players putting in all the effort and the rest of them just
come along as a baggage  The supply chain reference model
talks about four important steps in actually achieving external integration 
Step one, work on improving integration with the supplier, meaning look
at your upstream processes and align it in such a way that the
Do you think we have any standard procedure out there,
supplier is able to get a free flow of the three important
elements namely information, material and money  Step two, work
towards your customer  What we did towards the supplier,
remember, we are the supplier for the customer  Both the customer
and the supplier should try to use a collaborative effort to
improve the three flows  Point number three is slightly different 
We try to improve the visibility  Remember session
one, when we talked about measuring the supply chain
performance, we had discussed that we should measure the total
dollar days and inventory dollar days, meaning that information
whereby, supply chains can improve their external integration?

provide the business  A lot of opportunities to work with a
concept and role of supply chain globalization, facilitate you
different set of workers materials and products  This
method of selection of goods and services will mean to provide an
opportunity to select high quality with a low cost option 
The second one is identifying diverse customer in niche
markets  Globalization provides for more materials and labourers 
It also aids the new customers in a new market with new needs 
The third one is growth avenues  Advanced technologies and a
shrinking globe means that it is easier for the companies to
grow  When the business seems to be expand, it is clear that the
borders also expands which gives an added advantage the
towards successful implementation of supply chain
businesses and corporations in terms of business efficiency and
also profits  The fourth one is saving money  The added benefit
of globalization is that it increases the possibility for
varied materials, workers and also for transportation  These
can add up to more profit as the manufacturer or the producer can
choose among the best possible alternative for improving
profits  Supply Chain globalization is ruled by four
forces  The first one is global market forces which includes
global business environment that provides larger market for the
goods and services  The second one is technological forces  The
management, acquaint on the various aspects of supply chain
advanced cutting edge technologies reduces the
hindrances managing supply chains globally  The third one
is global cost forces  The cost advantages at global production
sites can be used to produce high quality and low cost
products  The final one is political and macro economic
forces  The companies can capitalize on trade agreements,
stable government situations, exempt policies, exchange rate
utilization, etc  A globalized marketplace has been both a boon
and bane  While the new markets have been ready to open
up, there are larger risks involved which could actually
globalization in manufacturing services sector, equipped to
have a greater impact on the survival capability of the
company  And also has all of these risks can go hand in hand
with each other, it is now very much critical for all the
manufacturers to improve their visibility on both their and
also their suppliers  With so much risk, the supply chain
system and global scale and help to mitigate the risk which is
worth the investment  The next recession we can discuss about
specific issues related to supply chain globalization and
manufacturing and services sector 
For a better understanding, you can take up an assignment, the
take supply chain decisions, provide insights on the impact
Welcome back to session two on supply chain globalization  The
technology in creating end to end Global Supply Chain
Solutions and how to make effective coordination of supply
chains  We have now achieved the learning outcome of how to
differentiate the various aspects of supply chain
globalization in manufacturing and services sector  And we
could now identify the importance of global supply
chains in the bonus sector  I have got an assignment for you
at the end of this session  To activate your Think Tank, there
is an exercise for you all to prepare a small supply chain
network of any company of your choice from the data available
about global supply chain and manufacturing, it actually takes
from an internet source  Thank you see you all in the next
session  Till then actively engaged in the assignment given 
manufacturing to the middle and all the suppliers of the
components to the left  Though the suppliers of the components
can be the most important for the ultimate designing of the
manufactured products in supply chain  The other utilities and
services cannot be the overall contributors of the cost of
operations  When we look at the businesses in a larger
perspective, where the countries are dependent on the neighboring
countries for the raw materials and the important spare
components, the situation might be a challenging task for the
learning objectives of session two would include acquainting
operations team as well as the management  As we all know that
globalized supply chain facilitates production in one
part of the world and it is all transported to another side of
the world, where the demand for these products are high  In this,
we need to understand that all the individual specific
components of the products are being manufactured or sourced
from various countries right from the smallest smartphones to
bigger products like cars or high tech machines are being
imported by various countries 
Firstly, the modern manufacturers make use of all
you all on the various aspects of supply chain globalization in
the available opportunities and possibilities to rule the
competition  Sometimes completely dependent on the contractors can
seem to be more affordable, but there can be a much greater risk
involved  As soon as the goods leave the factories, all the
decisions which are related to the system of distribution can
place a greater impact on the managerial decisions relating to
the investments in infrastructure of the
distribution and also gives an idea of transportation
contractors  Secondly, the quality improvement programs
like six sigma is constantly introducing some changes to the
manufacturing and services sector and equip you all to take
dynamics of supply chain which requires collaboration to a
greater extent with clients and suppliers than ever before 
Those producers who are using the just in time ordering system
can integrate order processing system directly with other
companies system through virtual networks  It can also be noticed
that in a just in time supply chain, the orders will be
processed in a mode which is automatic between the servers or
computers and both the customer and supplier ends  One among
this would place orders based on the electronic based inventory
levels and it has an important role in the payment process and
better supply chain decisions  As we have refreshed up with the
managing the queues of the new orders in the delivery order
queues  And also these are done without no human interaction 
For example, in automotive industry, the world's important
sector which is highly driven by globalization, car manufacturers
face high customer desires in terms of designs, technological
advancements, quality etc  Mercedes Benz has gone a huge
investment on reorganization offers global supply chain
network, which has reduced the cost of each victory by 20% 
They see continuous advancement in its global production network
towards efficient and flexible supply chain operations globally
general concepts of supply chain globalization, and the forces
aiming and growth  The smooth material flow is facilitated by
several service providers across the globe and also collaborate
with them for technological innovations  They follow a
strategy by named case which has expanded as connectivity,
autonomous, shared and services and electric which necessitates
wider supply network focusing on globalization  We will now look
into the supply chain globalization services sector 
Even if the traditional supply chain management model is very
common in manufacturing, the service industry also has the
same concept of supply chains  In a nutshell, the service
behind global supply chains in the earlier session, we can now
oriented supply chains require very high tech management  With
regard to the alarming trend towards the outsourcing of
business processes  And the idea of shifting or taking these
processes to offshore locations, it is important for all the
organizations to concentrate on changing the avenues for
procuring these services  First, there are a number of barriers
to address if service purchasing is to be improved  The factors
that need to be addressed in service sector supply chain
issues are a major aspect is related to lack of service focus
resources, information technology support, outsourcing,
understand the realities of supply chain globalization, with
requirements identification, and overall view on the service
spending areas continuous growth in the supply base  For example,
Deutsche Bank has initiated green supply chain framework
through which it insisted its client to submit energy
efficiency for the products  The bank procured smart machines,
recycling waste, had contracts for renewable energy,
it has improved the Eco efficiency performance of that
institution  Supply Chain globalization has its own
advantages and disadvantages in both manufacturing and service
sector  It is just not that globalization can create
respect to manufacturing and services sector  What is supply
prosperity, it is equally true that the supply chains can
create a lot of problems  Hence, the implications in this is that
all the members involved in the supply chain can take necessary
precautions and make sure that the entire network is not being
disturbed  We cannot ignore the globalization and so we must
take the necessary measures to protect us from the hazards of
the process  This is how the contingency and the continuity
planning play a vital role and also the proficiencies of the
stakeholders regulate the success of the supply chains
globally  The next session, we will look into the role of
chain globalization in manufacturing? When we talk
Welcome back to the last session of the module supply chain globalization 
coordination in supply chain management  The learning outcome
is completely fulfilled only when you join a business,
you can very well cooperate and collaborate with business
partners to deliver value and competitive advantage 
With this, we come to the end of this module 
Thank you best wishes 
composed of several entities like end customers, components
suppliers, a material product manufacturer, raw material,
service or a producer of services and even distributors 
Supply chain globalization structures largely changes based
on: the demand, technology needs, business focus, and equipment 
It definitely includes various other flows as well as
new entities  Payment flows from customers toward suppliers,
materials ordered and services move from suppliers towards customers 
Likewise, information also flows both ways 
Supply chains can also be notice to flow in reverse, which begins
Session three  The learning objectives of session three would be:
with those who would like to return such items as components
for replacement or repair all the return goods which are to
be considered for Remanufacturer  and also the
various other obsolete goods for disposal or recycling 
The forward chain, as well as the reverse chain both comprise of
cash or credits and also information flows 
The methodical way to understand the various stages of supply chain
globalization and the influential factors are presented 
Strategic Planning: Every efficient strategy for
supply chain starts with a long- term and solid decision making 
To provide insights on the impact of technology
This level of strategy places the start-ups to think of
a complete supply chain network and it provides a greater stride
to supply chain globalization  Issues to be considered at this
level can be comprehended as: Selecting strategic facilities
required for the business, to create a system of transporters,
and a very strong supplier who are reliable along with a good
logistics network  The major impact of the inventory
management system  Focus on (IT) programs and systems can be made
more effective  The next stage is tactical management 
In this tactical level, businesses always make a very short-term decision 
and supply chain globalization, to understand
The planning begins at the basic strategy level, but
all the other process are well defined in the tactical level 
These tactical decisions have a good impact on minimizing risks
and controlling cost  At this level, the major focus is to
attend to the customer choices and to achieve the best value 
The most common concerns at this stage are: Contracts for
procurement of the materials and services, production guidelines
and contracts which can help to meet quality standards,
inventory Management, including storage and end-product distribution,
financially viable value- addition practices in
what is supply chain coordination and related
comparison to the competitors  The last level is the
operational level  The operational level of supply
chain globalization is the most obvious one  These are the real
time process which keeps the supply chain active 
The key mistake or the drawback of any company is to leap directly into
operational management by not focusing on the plans at the
strategic and tactical levels  Best operational level processes
can be a result of concrete strategical and tactical planning 
Tactics of best operational level management can include
points like: Satisfying the demand through regular
decision and how it can be achieved  Supply chains
forecasting, production operations which include
scheduling and efficient management of work-in-process,
screening of all activities related to logistics and order fulfillment,
compensating the damages or losses which occurs
with vendors, suppliers and clients, handling both the
outgoing and incoming materials or products and the on-hand inventories 
Effective supply chain strategies are certainly
a result of a holistic operational approach  When all the three
levels of supply chain globalization are paid due
attention, each member of the supply chain will be benefited 
generally are composed of several entities like
It is evident that of late the supply chains have become much
more longer and more complex so that the severity and occurrence
of a supply chain disruptions are increasing to a greater extent 
There are numerous steps that both government as well as
the industry groups can make together to bring up supply
chains in a more vibrant and successful manner  To help these
both entities consumers can cooperate  All private sector
companies can back up the broad measures, but a very proactive
steps should be taken for the supply chains to be more strong and tough 
As an end note, when all of a sudden a greater
end customers, components suppliers, a material product
disruption happens in organization, the businesses
have to carry forward some mitigation plans which can bring
more market share to them than that of the competitors 
In the globalized scenario it is evident that the supply chains
formed or created during earlier stages need to be reformed for the
actual operation to face formidable challenges of VUCA environment 
The change element of "dynamic operations" can only
be a possible solution to accomplish this  I have a class
activity for you all  I would like to assign yourself with a
specific role of a retailer or a wholesaler, operating from
manufacturer, raw material, service or a producer of
different part of the world for various components of the
products to be manufactured and negotiate the supply chain contracts 
You can include decisions pertaining to pricing,
inventorying and ordering  Empower your thinking by applying the
latest advancement in technology  This can be prepared
as an instrument containing questions for better
manufacturer supplier negotiation  This accentuates
your learning about the negotiation environment in a globalized scenario 
Dear students! At the end of the session
you have gained ability to develop effective
services and even distributors  Supply chains generally are
Hi, this is Dr  Arthi, Associate Professor, Department
goods, complaints of regulations, analysis and
sourcing, source of finance, purchase order processing, enumerate
quality standards inventory management, disposal of waste
products raising invoice for payment  In the overall supply
chain process, procurement terminates once organization has
process the goods  To make a profit, the cost of procuring
goods must be at most lesser cost than the selling price of
the products less than the cost which are connected with
processing and selling them  Thus procurement is a broader
term and purchasing is just a subcomponent  The procurement
chains  And the outcome of the entire session on purchasing in
process includes 3 major functions categorized as
purchase order processing, receipt, confirmation, and
invoice verification in simple terms  The objective of
efficient procurement process is to reduce the operating cost 
One of the components that can reduce operating cost is
decreasing purchase cost  Retailers relay on specific
supplies to faster delivery to the customer expectations so
that the cost of holding costly inventories in stores can be
avoided  For example, electronic stores require faster delivery
of consumer durables to reduce high inventory cost  The global
global supply chains would be to recognize purchasing function as
supply chain includes players performing in the process of
logistics, purchasing, operations and market channels 
procurement includes both direct and indirect cost  Direct costs
are those required to produce or deliver the service that is
expected by the customers  Indirect costs are associated
with costs involved in day to day activities of the business
such as office equipment, stationaries and so on  Coming
to purchasing, it is a sub function of procurement 
Purchasing simply is buying and selling of goods and services 
Purchasing is a transaction oriented functional procurement 
a strategic business enabler, gain clarity among the functions
Now let's understand the terminology sourcing  Sourcing
refers snack to finding a source to supplying the goods and
services  Sourcing is considered to be a sub function of
procurement when procurement is related to acquiring goods and
services, whereas sourcing aims at identifying a competent to
supplier for the goods 
As the profits for business can be assured to the best range of
suppliers, sourcing is considered to be the first important step
taken by the business before the core activity of selling  The
supply chain starts with procurement and stops when the
of purchase procurement and sourcing, adequate knowledge
goods are brought to the premises for the production of
goods or services  If a company is in making office furniture
procurement is sourcing the raw materials needed to design the
furniture  Supply chain is the entire process involved in
sourcing producing and delivering the cabins notice
boards, seating, filing cabinets or other office furniture given
in the catalog to satisfy the customers  This session is
getting insights on the importance of global purchasing
and basic understanding of terminologies like procurement,
purchase and sourcing  Thus we try to achieve the outcome of
about global purchasing trends and suitability to business
gaining clarity to enhance our knowledge to proceed with
further topics 
needs, apply practically the appropriate global purchasing
decisions to ensure organizational success  And you
can easily design global purchase strategies as core
capabilities of organization  we are going to focus on
session 1,with the first 2 learning objectives  I'm happy
of Business Administration of Avinashilingam Institute for
to address you all in this session with a focus on the
objectives to understand how important global purchasing is
Identify the differences with procurement function  Your full
attention will help you to prepare for few exercises at the
end of the session  Tracing back to early 1970s, purchasing was a
basic function rather than playing a strategic role in the
organization  We place the entelibrate attention on vital
core competencies, SMEs and even many big organizations don't
consider purchasing as one of their core petencies  Global
supply chains swirl around with purchasing as a
Home Science and Higher Education for Women  I'm very
vital function  Purchasing occurs in the crucial areas of
the supply chain that is the inbound or an upstream  The
purchasing function involves the process of procuring raw
materials, components, monitoring work in process products or
services and which requires a smooth integration in the
production cycle for international organizations  The
different types of purchasing strategies involved in the
global purchasing are outsourcing and multisourcing,
global customer relationship management, worldwide channel
management, order fulfillment and delivery, global supplier
happy to take you through the module on purchasing in global
selection and global supply networks, which is depicted in
figure 1  Hence, global purchasing is integral in the
global supply chain management that is connected with the
buying of goods and services or information required by the
multinational companies around the world  It is to be noted
that 90 percentage of global demand is not fully met by local
supplies and global supply chains will soon account for
25% of multi national firms performance  Further, the supply
chains need to develop 43% more global in the next decade, so
that a firm's competitive edge is sharpened in the global
supply chains  This is divided into 3 sessions and all the
arena  It is imperative to locate global operations and
develop need based global supply chains which require strategic
planning and control  Developing global supply chains that
provide quick access to the resources, the organization
currently needs or potentially aim for to achieve its strategic
objectives  Further, the overall supply chain and inventory cost
can be reduced which can improve the purchase process and thereby
help the management to maintain better communication with the
vendor  As to identification of the materials in the delivery
process and payment to the international logistics and the
3 sessions will focus on the following learning objectives 
provision of the global supply chain are major building blocks
of development of international trade  The needs of the global
market are widening, allowing for more purchase options and
expect sustainable efforts  From the organization so
strategically utilize the opportunities  For example,
Walmart is a great example of global supply chain development,
aiming, greater efficiency and even creating supply chains,
which has helped increasing purchasing power of the bottom
of the pyramid customers  Walmart has achieved a
competitive edge by administering the coordination
Understand the importance of global purchasing, identify
of the raw materials to end customer global supply chain to
maximize efficiencies and total costs  That is to provide
greater total value than many other companies, which is a
competitive advantage when compared to other firms  They
have an efficient network of global supply chains which offer
low cost versions of products monitored by the bottom of the
pyramid customers  Strategically, within the integrated global
supply chain of multinational corporations  It is predicted
that purchasing as a function will become 13% more globalized
as crude in the 5 years period between 2013 and 18 and
differences with procurement function, comprehend global
29% more globalized in the next 10 years by 20,23  The
important object of global supply chain management is to
integrate the marketplace, distribution network, procurement
activity, manufacturing, processing, assembly process
etc  in such a way that customers experience greater
satisfaction at lower cost  Supply Chain Management focuses
heavily on operations management, logistics,
procurement, demand and supply planning, transportation process
warehousing order fulfillment  , We will see the next
aspect of learning objective of differentiation among the
purchasing trends, illustrations across global purchase options,
terminologies of purchasing, procurement and sourcing 
Procurement is a managerial function  Procurement involves
acquiring of products and services, especially for the
undertaking business operations  It includes a number of
activities right from identifying the need of goods
and services to its acquisition to complete the production
process  To know the difference in these terminologies, we need
to focus on the basic active in each function procurement
involves activities like identify appropriate suppliers,
design payment conditions, negotiating prices, buying
enumerate critical success factors for purchasing in global

with 65% being sourced externally 
The next decision is to back to purchase either domestically or globally 
This leads as to take on the types of purchasing
where and how? And the 4 choices for purchasing strategies are
domestic internal purchasing,
global internal purchasing, domestic external purchasing
and global external purchasing 
Let's see each one in detail  Domestic internal purchasing 
It is a type when a multinational corporation buys
raw material from one of its own associates
It is interesting and important to note
that produces them in one of the company's factories located locally 
This is referred to as domestic in house sourcing 
Global internal purchasing:
In this type of purchasing a multinational corporation gets
its raw materials from
one of its subsidiary company which is produced
in one of the firm's factories outside the country 
This is referred to as off shore subsidiary sourcing 
Domestic external purchasing:
In this type the company's purchases
from the article written by Robert Trent and Robert Monica 
raw materials from one of its suppliers
that produces them in one of its factories in the home country 
This is simply called us purchasing from vendors 
Global external purchasing this occurs when the corpration gets
its raw material from one of its vendors which is made in their global factories 
This is otherwise referred to as offshore outsourcing 
It is expected that there would be a
continued progress in external purchases 
In the future man home countries functional groups
will be placed globally to take care of global supply links 
In their article written in MIT Sloan Management Review in 2005,
Global sourcing is due to free trade policies and the supply basis can be expanded 
There are other options like outsourcing,
insourcing, nearshoring, multi sourcing,
home sourcing, co sourcing,
and we will see one by one in detail 
Let's start with outsourcing:
Outsourcing successfully when trusted permits between buyer and vendor 
Outsourcing is a process 
when an international corporation purchases materials or parts
from any of its suppliers that produces them locally or globally,
where they have mentioned the
for example, chemicals and plastics travel distances to reach India and China 
In sourcing, this is a strategy which is followed
when companies experience poor quality raw materials, late deliveries etc 
In that case, the company itself produces
its requirements internally  This will reduce the lead time
and can reach customers fast  It is also known as back sourcing 
Nearshoring happens when there is transfer of business
activity or information technology processes to suppliers
in a neighboring country, often between the countries sharing same borders 
This strategy facilitates global external purchasing 
7characteristics of outstanding global purchasing strategies 
Multi sourcing is a strategy followed when a company gets
parts of its business activities accomplished
and IT services from the ideal set of local and external service providers
based on the corporate goals 
Home sourcing which is also called as home shoring
refers to a company transferring service industry employment
from their offices to employees work from home
with appropriate communication technology,
who can be located anywhere in the world 
This depicts a future purchasing scenario 
They are Executive Commitment to Global Purchasing,
Co-sourcing occurs when there is sharing of a process of function,
which uses both its own employees from inside the firm
and an external supplier to perform certain tasks 
When there is a goal compatibility between the buyer and the supplier 
Generally used for non value adding activities
For example, Co-sourcing for a consulting firm can be to
utilize multilingual capabilities 
The organizations in future will apply
value engineering techniques like
early supplier involvement in case of new product development,
Rigorous and well defined Processes,
Vendor Managed Inventory services to keep customers 
Which minimizes the carrying cost and allows for co managed inventories 
Supplier Co-location is another strategy wherein
suppliers employees are deputed in the buyers organization 
Strategic Alliance Development between the buyer
and the supplier jointly work for a win win alliance creating
a transparent environment for mutual gains 
Finally, it is apply a procurement system
when there is a large volume of material purchase globally,
which can be made at ease with advanced technologies
Availability of Needed Resources,
which promotes ethical purchasing
and helps to establish green supply chain 
All these aspects related to the different purchase options
would reduce material costs and throughput time 
therefore delighting the customers  With the session,
we have a few questions put forth to recalculate what was discussed 
We can just ponder upon 2 aspects, the future purchasing pattern,
How it is going to be in the hospitality industry 
And we can try to enumerate on the different types of purchase decisions
possible to manage supply chains effectively 
Integration through Information Technology
Thank you  We will meet in the next session 
Supportive Organizational Design,
, We are going to focus on the second session
Structured approaches to Communication,
Methodologies for measuring savings 
You try to follow picture one which depicts
the purchasing activities at different levels 
Let's start by highlighting the 5 levels of purchasing 
In level 1,the companies in this level
exhibit a special characteristic feature of
having their operations only at the domestic level 
Most of these companies often
keep their production closer to the domestic markets,
on purchasing in global supply chains 
even for the purpose of purchasing raw materials,
components, parts and other requirements for their operations 
For example, an Indian firm purchases
the castings for its business from another Indian firm 
Such companies are home oriented
as they purchase all their inputs for their production process,
within the home country and they do not engage outside the country 
If you just look at levels 2 and 3 from the figure,
it is in contrast to level 1 companies 
These companies in level 2 and 3
Hope the assignments given in the previous session
involved in international purchasing in various degrees and forms 
Level 2 companies engage in international purchasing activities only when need arises 
Hence, their approach to international purchasing is reactive 
And disintegrated among the purchasing locations within the form
and across the various units of the form like
strategic business units or functional units 
Companies at level 3 engage in international purchasing
as a regular integral part of their business 
They believe that they international purchasing
is a part of their overall supply chain management strategy 
was very useful, and you could collect data and have gained knowledge 
They realize that a well defined international purchasing
strategy can enhance their competitive position in the market place 
Let's see the companies in level 4 and 5 
At both these levels the company is involved in global purchasing, but in varied levels 
In level 4, the global purchasing activities of the firm takes
place worldwide with the supply chain 
This involves coordinated and integrated purchasing strategies for
the purchasing activity worldwide across the form buying locations 
Matters Level 5 involves in global purchasing not only with the supply chain,
but also with the functional group of the firm located worldwide 
Welcome back to the second session of purchasing in global supply chains 
Hence, the company brings about a global integration the purchase of
common items, purchasing process
identification of supplier and other functions 
This indicates that the company ought to construct
a global design which will integrate
global logistics,global processes and worldwide market channels 
This will result in an effective management of supply chain globally,
Looking into the data for the domestic
international global purchasing for 2013, and also for 2018
and a forecast is also projected for 2023,from the figure 
This session will focus on the 2 aspects of
Clearly there is a movement,
such as level 1 focuses on engaging solely in local purchasing activities 
In level 1, we see a downward trend from 33% of
the companies involved in only home based purchasing in 2013
to 26% in 2023  Level 2 shows a steady forecast
with 22% of the company's concentrate in international purchasing
activities only when need arises 
Level 4 scenario shows about 15 % of the company's
allocating their purchasing efforts over the next decade 
The significant changes based on the opinion from purchasing professionals
global purchasing trends and different global purchase options 
will mainly in the level 3 and level 5 categories 
The forecast data reveals that the companies would actively involved
in a global purchasing and supply chains globally
and also functionally groups to capitalize on the strengths of the global supply chains 
Let's see the different types of purchasing strategy 
Apart from the strategies of global purchasing discussed earlier,
like the domestic and international
purchasing decision has other levels in which the selection of a decision
will be highly compatible for the organization 
Figure 2 illustrates the basic options that are available 
We are going to travel from domestic
The adaptability of Masaki kotaeb and Kristian Helsen's model
for the selection of decision is to be discussed in the section 
The purchasing options may be related to the inputs
product assembly or produce within a country to serve the internal markets 
The decision relating to the use of suppliers from local
or cross border markets for components of finished products is another crucial one 
The purchasing decision making tree presence
to decision points of internal purchasing
this is external purchasing  It is shown that
35% of purchasing in multinational corporations today is internal,
to international to global purchasing at different levels 
Let me take you through the last lap of this module on purchasing
to global suppliers in support of global purchasing  In this
case, a global supplier is not having different global
locations but assisted buying firms worldwide
requirements competitively  The 7th success factors related
to performance measurement systems  In this organization
need to gauge the performance to effectively manage global
purchasing like reward system to employees involved, maintain
transparency in global purchasing agreements in terms
of performance gains  The final point is related to
communication and coordination mechanisms  The current day
of Michigan State University which is conducted through the
supply chains experienced disruptions thus demanding
appropriate communication and coordination system to support
global purchasing  Missing links can be avoided through regular
review meetings, use of internet technology colocation of
experts, continuous strategy development and efforts  If
there is no communication or coordination performance gets
affected and cost savings becomes impossible  If a company
rightly focus in these 8 success areas, the overall global
purchasing effort will be highly successful  With the knowledge
on purchasing trends different purchase options, critical
global procurement and supply chain benchmarking initiative,
success factors in mind  Now you are well equipped to design
strategies for purchasing in global supply chains  We close
this module successfully achieving the learning outcome
specify  Wish you all good luck 
wherein data had been collected from more than 200 companies
which has enlisted 8 factors as strategic to success for
purchasing in global supply chains  We will go through the
8 factors one by one  The first factor is organizational
support  Structure organizations as you all know or neural
networks, which has a lot of information processing before
decision making, the organization structure need to
be flexible to allow global purchasing the organization can
in global supply chains  Madden will discuss about the success
plan for cross functional teams, cross locational teams, global
purchase offices, offices to oversea global purchase
operations  The ezile global activities will ensure great
success in achieving the targets  The organizations can follow can
CAD mix model with 4 layers namely govern which is related
to decision making and that related to innovative
infrastructure, orchestrate and the end to end process and
execute to achieve operational outcomes  The second point is
related to executive commitment  The important aspect for
purchasing in global supply chain is the executive
factors for purchasing in global chains and fulfill the outcome
commitment in developing a well formulated global purchase
process, budget allocation, expert availability to handle
operations, performance scores to monitor exhibitors, effective
advisory board to guide the process, sharing the gains
achieved among the members of the organization  Global supply
chains are emerging as dynamic process networks which requires
high commitment at levels and team management will enable best
response to market requirements  The third one is related to
organizational resource availability  The integrated and
efficient working of the supply chains need efficient people are
of analyzing and creating purchase decisions which should
involved at various processes  The entire business activities
are heavily dependent on supply chain stretching operational
excellence  The organization's to have experts with
capabilities and knowledge, futuristic technology to support
supply chain operations as well as finance appropriation for a
total alignment with corporate goals  The fourth success
factors related to information systems and technology  The
technological innovations in supply chains will effect the
way organizations buy and sell in future the intelligent and
smart systems and managing supply change globally will
stratergically suit the organization  The critical
support global purchasing as the world is moving towards virtual
supply chains, resulting in real time actionable data,
simplifying supply chains eliminate unnecessary links and
enhance customer communication  The fifth point is related to
well defined global sourcing process  It is to be noted thata
right approach to and processes for global purchasing is
essential  In this context, let's ponder on an important
process attached with the order fulfillment and delivery, which
is the last part of supply chain  The purchasing strategy
emanating from the headquarters namely Center Lead Purchasing
success factors that we are going to deliberate upon will
which anchors purchasing both domestic and global order
fulfillment in case of delivery both domestic as well as global
delivery  We define order fulfillment as purchase dealing
with business to customers such as purchasing between entities 
Cannot Boyd, Markham frolic and Thomas halt suggest 4
different strategies  We will discuss as projected in the
given two by two matrix  There are 4 quadrants namely, fully
extended, centralized, extended, semi extended and decoupled  On
the either sides of x and y axis, we have order fulfillment and
delivery respectively  Ford Motor Company is going to be our
help you to design global purchase strategies with the
example, based on which we'll discuss the 4 quadrants  Ford
Motor Company, as we all know, is based in Michigan, which has
wide global operations and works on different options for order
fulfillment and delivery, which follows centralized global
purchasing  Let's look into the lower left quadrant which
portrays a fully extended global supply chain where fulfillment
takes place in the home country and delivery is also to a home
country location domestic order fulfillment and domestic
delivery  An example of the scenario could be for purchasing
car seats from magna from the sorry and delivered at its plant
knowledge that you have gained in the previous 2 sessions  We
at river rhones plant in Michigan  Moving to the lower
right quadrant showing centralized state standard
global supply chain  Purchasing takes place in a foreign country
and delivered at home country location, that is global order
fulfillment and domestic delivery  Continuing the same
example, Ford purchasing its axles from Dona-Talesol
uruguay and supply to its production base in flatrock,
Michigan  The top left quadrant shows the semi extended strategy
purchasing in the home country and delivery to your foreign
country location, which portrays domestic order fulfillment and
will now focus on the critical success factors for purchasing
global delivery  An example of this combination could be Ford,
purchasing car seats from Magna based at its plant in Missouri,
and dispatched to Saint Petersburg, Russia  The top
right quadrant illustrates the decouple strategy sourced in
foreign country and delivered to a foreign location where the
scenario is global order fulfillment and global delivery 
In this scenario for purchasing its axles from Dona-Talesol
Based in uruguay and sent to its factories site in Saint
Petersburg, Russia, the sixth the success factor is related to
access to global suppliers  The organization need to have access
in global supply chains  We will highlight the research findings
, we are going to focus on session one, which will reach
in order to increase flexibility, and at the same
time, reduce variability and uncertainity of the customers
demand  An efficient demand management requires insight and
understanding of the importance of demand forecasts and keen
observation of the market forces and how they impact on the
demand factors  The fifth point is related to service
management  Service delivery management may be defined as the
process of making promises to the customers and keeping up
those promises  This involves 3 small steps define a
customer order, create a network for delivery and deliver the
the impact of supply chain management practices on the
order  An empowered service delivery system with effective
support system like facilities, infrastructure, etc, may render
the firm more competitive enough in the business  The sixth
aspect is related to cash flow management  One of the critical
challenges in the Supply Chain Management is ensuring reliable
and predictable flow of funds with the partners in the chain
having an anonymous idea for the same  The activities related to
cash flow for paying suppliers, internal transfer, invoicing
customers etc should be administered  Automation of the
payment process and monitoring the flow of cash using
performance of service businesses  And you can easily
technology will facilitate better management  The seventh
point is related to capacity and space management  As the service
sector is labor intensive and deals with intangible output it
is highly essential to manage the capacity and skills of the
firm  As for capacity, it is mentioned to the resources of
the firm that will be utilized to satisfy the customer desires,
needs and skills refers to the acquisition and retention of
qualified staff who can facilitate the process of
delivering value to the customers  Well, in this
session, we have covered the first learning objective of supply
explain the significance of service supply chain  You can
chain management practices of service industry and I hope you
can ponder upon 2 questions which is put forth now for
further insights  You can try to understand the business being
performed in case of ineffective cash flow management  How can
the business be performed in case if there is any problem in
case of cash flow management and how the supply chain management
helps in the sustainable future of the service industry  Further,
in the upcoming session we will discuss on the other aspects of
supply chain management and service investing  Look
forward for the next session on service supply chains  Thank you
interpret and understand the challenges in service supply
chain in alignment with solutions to the business form 
You can very easily design an effective servqual model for
business and we can analyze the effectiveness of supply chain
management in business  , we are going to focus on session
one, which will reach the objective of understanding the
supply chain management in service industry  Most
the objective of understanding the supply chain management in
researches in the concept of Supply Chain Management
pertained to the manufacturing industries in spite of its
prevalence in service industry  The growth of the service sector
is to is so enormous since 1970s that it contributes 73% to the
global economic output and about 70% of economic activity of many
developed nations  Companies in the service industry are trying
their best in increasing their efficiency, responsiveness and
flexibility in order to emerge as competitive with their
counterparts in the industry  This can be made possible only
when they are confident enough about the goodness of their
service industry  In this module on supply chain management and
operation strategy, methods and technologies involved in a
supply chain management, it is essential for the form statuses
and analyze the performance of the various practices involved
in the supply chain management  It is highly difficult to define
or classify the service sector unlike the manufacturing sector 
It may be essentially defined as everything except manufacturing
and farming  business activities in relation to transportation,
communication, finance, insurance, real estate, public
administration travel, hospitality, wholesale and
retail trades may be categorized as services  Delivering value to
service sector, we have 5 learning objectives across
the customer is the main <fw/>mantra of service industry  The
industry depends much on people's education and values
and ethics rather than goods and products  The service sector is
the contributor of largest employment opportunities to
people of any country  Owing to globalization, the markets for
products and services have expanded each and every product
that has customers worldwide  This makes the supply chain
management practices take center stage as the scenario has
increased the demands of the customers in terms of higher
quality services, lower prices, faster delivery, increased
acquaint knowledge on the supply chain management practices of
variety etc  Supply Chain Management in services industry 
There are many proven studies on the importance of supply chain
management practices to any business as it creeps on the
objective maximization of overall value generated and
delivered to the end user  Further, supply chain management
is essential to reap benefits for the firm, such as cost
minimization, effective delivery, star rated performance
etc  Any company whether manufacturing or service
requires effective supply chain management practices as it
contributes lion's share towards the firm's performance and
service industry, understand the concept of service supply chain
growth  While considering the service sector it is difficult
to set up a specific distribution channel as the
services are intangible and inseparable from the person
performing the same  ACM practices refers to a set of
activities undertaken by a company in order to facilitate
effective management of its supply chain and a sustainable
future for the business  The figure projected shows 2 types
of objectives short term and long term objectives  The supply chain
management practices in service sector are information flow
management  Let's see one by one  The first one is
and know the specific issues related to service supply chain
information flow management  Information flow is considered
essential for integration in any strategy Cullins by providing
the right information to the right person at the right time 
Information flow in the supply chain will serve data on various
aspects of the business like demand forecasting, defining the
scope of work ,skill required from the provider of the service
and also feedback on the performance  The information
flow management is a practice that links all the people
involved in the supply chain with the data that is collected,
transmitted and utilized for the processing of information
and we are going to comprehend the service quality model  And
required to complete all other management processes smoothly 
The second one is related to customer relationship
management  Customer is the king of the business and the
satisfied customer is the success of any business  CRM is
a strategic approach that focuses on increasing the
shareholder value for the company through extending a
cordial relationship between the company, customer and customer
segments  Integration of CRM in the supply chain was facilitate
and boost up the shareholder value of the firm and will
increase the performance of the business  The third one is
we will look into a business case applying service quality
related to supplier relationship management  Modern supply chains
are so designed that the supplies have a direct impact on
the success or failure of the supply chain networks  Supplier
relationship management has become crucial because most of
the supply chains depend on outsourcing and SRM refers to
the process in which customers and suppliers build a long term
relationship as partners  The fourth point is related to
demand management, in the supply chain refers to the
efforts made towards establishing a balance between
customer requirements and the capabilities of the supply chain
model and we focus on the learning outcome of enumerating
Supply_chain_Management_10362
large number of branches situated
in different parts of the country in the world 
This will give place to huge number of suppliers
for various products interlinked with the operations of the business
and the monitoring of such suppliers becomes tedious 
In order to manage the suppliers and to reduce overhead costs
and avoid duplication of work that companies have to adopt
to centralization of purchase through technology
or e-procurement and also should follow a strict
service level agreements and make periodic reviews of the same 
and they work towards the objective of achieving higher efficiency or responsiveness 
Coming to the simultaneous production and delivery 
Services are of nature that they are creation of time and consumption of time,
which are the same  Hence there is no return
or exchange of the service enjoyed  For example, when a client goes to an IT
service provider and uses the computer for surfing
he enjoys the service and in case he doesn't feel satisfied
about the frequency or speed of the connectivity,
he cannot argue with the service provider 
This is an important consideration in the service supply chain management 
With a about specific issues in the service supply chain
Service supply chains usually involve the customer
today's session is closed  Further we will discuss about the service quality model
and a case study in the next session 
Here are a few questions to recap the sessions content 
The first question may be how do you think outsourcing
helps better performance of service supply chains?
And you can try to differentiate the single level
and the two level bidirectional relationship 
Thank you 
as a direct participant in the chain 
Unlike the physical goods supply chain 
With reason developments of information technology,
the customers are involved in a direct faction,
and the new knowledge management strategies create
more opportunities to acquire a competitive advantage 
It involves the customers, set strategies also pave
way for improvement in the quality of service,
Welcome back This is the second session of
while trying to reduce the cost of providing the service 
The figure attached shows a conceptual supply chain of service,
but the approach to and the relative importance of each component is different 
We will focus
on the specific issues in service supply chain 
As mentioned earlier, the supply chain of service vastly different
from that of the product supply chain 
There are many reasons to it and few of which are deliberated now 
Customer Supplier Duality 
The first issue is related to customer supplier duality 
Supply Chain Management in Service Industry 
In services, the activities initiated by the customer 
Any service involves any act or deed
that involves a physical or mental inputs from the customer
or any information that is being provided by the customer 
Hence, the customer not only sticks as a customer,
but also as a supplier to the service 
As the customer plays dual role this scenario is
called Customer Supplier Duality in Service Supply Chain 
The customer supplier duality is called the bidirectional relationship
between customer and the service provider,
This session we will focus on the concept of service supply chain
which is depicted in the picture attached 
The bidirectional relationship of the customer supplied duality may be of two types:
One is the single level  The second one is the two level 
The single level bidirectional relationship is
a condition where the customer
provides inputs to the service providers 
The service providers handles the information, process it,
implements changes according to the inputs and converts them into output
in the service production process and delivers to the customers 
The two level bidirectional relationship as it is depicted in the picture 
and the specific challenges and the issues related to service supply chain 
In this relationship the customer provides
inputs to the service provider
which is in turn provided to the suppliers
are the second level service providers
who assist in the process of converting the inputs into outputs
in the production process and deliver back to the customer 
And it is explained to an example in the healthcare sector 
Packaged Services  Few service providers offer
their services as a package the customer 
A service package includes all the services offered by various service providers 
The network of activities involved in a service delivery system,
This saves more time for the customers besides
providing them with convenience 
Package services are mostly found in tourism and hospitality
industry wherein the tour oprater has good linkages, airlines, restaurants,
transportation services and other services in order to provide the customers
with a wholesome experience of the tour or a holiday trip 
Outsourcing  Outsourcing has become one of the most
trending activity of services like banking, financial services, insurance
and telecommunication services 
Most of the companies have began to outsource
which are connected with the number of participants
their internal operations to focus on core competencies 
The specialists firms which offers service outsourcing are referred to as
business process outsourcing, who are offered
the inhouse services of the companies 
IT and IT enabled services firms are also
emerging as giants on whom the companies depend to
outsource their inhouse operations 
Outsourcing helps the business to focus on the core competencies
and on other hand it is more feasible for the companies
that have global presence to understand
who work in an unified direction for a successful delivery of
the local market and its demands when outsourced 
Further outsourcing will help to reduce the employee base
which within an organization, which in turn will help in reducing the operation cost 
Beside it will also provide enough access to additional skills and capacity
which will be an expensive process when it is done inhouse 
We have an example attached 
A North American Company named Allianz life insurance company has outsourced
various operations to a number of companies
and it is depicted in the picture given 
Which are all the company's Allianz had outsourced
value to the customer is referred to as service supply chain 
and for what operation they have
having a alliance with the other companies is given 
Managing suppliers in service supply chains 
How are we going to manage the suppliers in the service supply chains?
Enjoying a service is very less control
when compared to the purchasing of a product 
The challenge in the service sector is the over billing in most service
contracts, differences in defining the service levels by vendors,
comparing purchase with the real worth of the service enjoyed etc 
Another challenge is managing the purchasing activities of
All the participants of the service supply chain are mutually related
Supply_chain_Management_10490
This helps them get the right feedback from the customer
to be utilized for improving the service quality 
Further they have a constant check on executive
log in volumes in a certain area,
zone-wise cancellation rates, demand supply match
in that area for both food and delivery executives 
The picture attached explains
the scene behind this aspect 
Supply_chain_Management_10499
The next one we are going to look into is responsiveness 
and the customer satisfaction and it is more likely applicable
Realizing the time sensitive nature of food,
and the intention to help the customers in line with their willingness 
Swiggy has made efforts to deliver the best on demand
consumer experience and hence,
they themselves are in the delivery business 
The quality of food is inversely proportional to the time
it takes to deliver it and in turn when it is consumed 
And this is when swiggy had introduced the live order tracking of the order status 
The next dimension is related to empathy 
Unlike any regular e-commerce business
to the service sector rather than the manufacturing sector 
swiggy is a three way marketplace in a hyperlocal setting
wherein there has to be a mass of consumers,
enough restaurants to be interlinked and the delivery executives at all times 
This will aim to satisfy the needs of
each and every consumer and care for his needs 
The app is so customized with personalized care as it shows
food preferences, the live snapshot of delivery executives
in customer's area, which restaurants are live, enough
variety that range across all price points and cuisines and more 
Swiggy makes it all possible with a big data
Developed by the academic researchers Zeithaml, Parasuraman and Berry,
and an impressive engineering team who work on real time accurate information,
amidst constantly changing dynamics 
When a service firm focuses on the service quality and designs
an impressive service quality model
that allows the customers reap all the benefits of the service 
The supply chain management proves to be highly effective 
With an understanding of all the concepts related
to supply chain management and service industry,
we have now completed this module successfully
achieving the learning objectives 
the SERVQUAL model pertains to market research concept
Wish you good luck 
as it studies the customer satisfaction 
But the model can be very well linked to the service supply chain
as the ultimate goal of the supply chain is to deliver value to the customer 
Lets see the driving forces of the service quality model 
As mentioned earlier, this model applies more to the service
organizations rather than the manufacturing organization 
Welcome back to session three of
The driving forces that influence the development of the model are
intangibility heterogeneity
of the services rendered by the value firm 
These unique characteristics render it difficult
for the firm to assess the service quality objectively 
Hence, these two factors are considered important reasons
to assess the service quality of the firm 
The model is also called as the gap model
as it helps the firm analyze the gap
between the service quality performance and actual service quality needs of the customer 
supply chain management in service sector,
The model serves as a structure
approach to be utilized by the service firm straces service quality 
The five dimensions of
the service quality model are tangibles,
reliability, assurance, responsiveness and empathy 
Tangibles is related to physical facilities infrastructure equipments 
Reliability: The ability of the firm to keep up the promises
dependably and accurately  Assurance is related to
the knowledge and courtesy of the employees and their ability
to build trust and confidence 
wherein we will discuss about the service quality model
Responsiveness is related to firm's willingness
to help the customer and provide prompt service 
Empathy is to care for the customers and provide individualized attention 
So, these are all comprehensively
the five components of service quality model 
The benefits of service quality model 
The firms can improve their service quality by making
a thorough examination of the service needs and service quality 
Service quality provides detailed information on few aspects like:
How the customers perceive the service?
and analyze it with the help of a case study 
How the customers perceive the performance?
How the employees perceive the customer satisfaction and expectation?
customers comments and suggestions?
This would help the firms make improve their service quality 
There are certain limitations of this model 
When this model is put to application,
there arises a doubt on the following issues:
The issues may be related to validity of the five dimensions
included, uniform applicability of the five dimensions to all the services,
use of different scores contributes to problem with reliability 
This will bring about a better understanding of the significance
And now we will focus on a case 
Let's start with understanding the SERVQUAL model
by considering Swiggy as an example 
Swiggy is a Bangalore based food ordering and delivery company 
It operates on a single window for ordering food
from a wide range of restaurants and not only that have own
an exclusive network of delivery personal who will
really carry out and pick up orders from restaurants and deliver it to customers 
It is a complete food ordering and delivery solution
that connects neighborhood restaurants with urban foodies 
that service quality has in the performance of the supply chain 
The SERVQUAL model of swiggy is now explained
with the dimensions, tangibles  Delivering food is the core they do 
Hence it is a trio user line wherein the customers
restaurants and the delivery executives come in to see 
Being an app based business, the infrastructure facilities that
they require is IT that connects consumers, restaurants
and the delivery executives 
The executives delivered the food in a two wheeler 
Further there has to be a regional and zonal level personnel
who act as customer service executives to address
Let's now start with the service quality model 
any issues or challenges that arise 
The next aspect is related to reliability 
The promise and the predictability of the supply chain plays
a huge role in the consumers choice 
No doubt that they encounter uncertainties in dish preparation times,
restaurants efficiency, delivery, executive's speed,
changing traffic conditions
and his familiarity with the area to name a few 
If the consumer decides to order, his or Her favorite dish,
but the delivery time is, for example 62 minutes
From the name of the model it is clear that it refers to service quality 
they fail on a promise of timely delivery 
If a consumer orders a particular dish,
but we then found that the restaurant is out of that dish,
we fail on this promise of availability 
But besides all this, they are able to serve the consumers with
hunger savior in just a few minutes 
The next point is related to assurance 
Right away in the app, there are options for the customers
to rate the food of the restaurant
and also the performance of the delivery executives 
This module is essentially used to measure the service quality
Music
most of the times, they have always provided
what you had asked for and the prices are nominal 
Music
And further,
Music
they are not very
Music
stuck on receiving payments immediately
Music
Music
and although you are regular and paying,
Music
you have a periodic payment policy
Music
and
Music
this bakery is okay with it 
Music
You have an official meeting
Music
inside the firm
with some foreign delegates 
Music
These delegates are very specific about what they eat 
Music
So,
Music
you call this bakery
Music
and place an order for
Music
Music
special items that you think these foreign delegates are going to have
because they have mentioned it to you 
Music
You asked for pre-packaged juice and a special kind of biscuits 
Music
You have ordered
Music
for a group of 30 
Music
Now, this order
by breaking down
Music
goes from the front office,
Music
to the back office people who service this order
Music
and
Music
the back office people usually understand the orders 
Music
But on this particular day,
Music
Music
the usual boy who takes the order
Music
he is on leave, he is sick
Music
and somebody else has been filled in
Music
instead of him 
Music
He totally misunderstoods the order 
the walls of
Music
And
Music
instead of delivering
Music
packaged juice
Music
and the special biscuits,
Music
he delivers tea and puffs 
Music
Music
Your guests and I learned that it chit of all
Music
is in that a situation 
Music
Let's consider the same bakery 
Music
Let us see another scenario 
Music
Let us assume
various silos
Music
the new boy who is filling in,
Music
hears the number as 13 one three instead of 30 
Music
And
Music
he delivers
Music
13 sets
Music
Music
of packaged drinks and biscuits to you 
Music
And
Music
he is extra punctual 
Music
Meaning, if the meeting is at 10 o'clock
9 55 sharp,
Music
that have been formed over time 
Welcome to this module on
the 13 sets of refreshment
Music
greet you 
Music
All the delegates are sitting inside remember, there are 30 of them,
Music
30
Music
and you have received only 13 sets 
Music
Music
Is that not an embarrassment now?
Music
However I explain it,
Music
what are your options?
Music
Well,
Music
you can see how serious miscommunication can be 
Music
This module
Or we could have another situation here 
Music
The bakery is
Music
out of biscuits 
Music
, he places an order to the supplier,
Music
supplier doesn't turn up 
Music
Music
Your meeting is at 10 o'clock, he waits till 10:20 
Music
The guests are waiting, refreshment hasn't come 
Music
You are tensed up 
You make calls and he says, "Yeah, it's on the way" 
Music
And finally half an hour late,
Music
he just delivers the chilled drinks,
tries to explain
Music
no biscuits 
Music
What do you think you could do?
Music
What will your delegates think about you?
Music
Don't you think it is the duty of the bakery
to inform you well in advance that he didn't have a biscuit 
Music
Music
Probably you could have made arrangements for
Music
alternate snacks for them or you could have probably
told them that this is the situation
do let us know if you can adjust with something else 
Music
But
Music
a wrong product reaching the place is definitely going to be an issue 
Music
this
Is this not a serious situation?
Music
All the cases mentioned till now,
Music
are classic examples
Music
of a lack of integration between different departments in a firm
Music
of bakery is an extremely simple example 
Music
Music
You can see that there is a barrier between
Music
the person on the cash counter receiving the calls
Music
and the person in the back office who is actually servicing your order 
Music
Such a small
Music
distance and a small miscommunication can cause
a huge embarrassment at the customer end 
feature of integration 
Music
Imagine its a huge firm,
Music
5000 employees,
Music
15 departments 
Music
Each department has their own priorities  Each one is occupied,
may get 500 orders every day 
Music
Music
Every 10 minutes there is a change in order 
Music
Every single worker has to find out what the other person wants 
Its never given in a clear format 
Music
Assume what happened if the bakery happens even in 10% of these cases,
Music
what do you think the result would be?
Music
It will be
Learning objectives 
Music
Music
chaos 
Music
And
Music
this is because there is no integration between different departments 
Music
By integration we mean different departments
should not draw boundary walls saying that,
Music
Music
that's your property and this is my property,
Music
after all we all together are one single firm 
Boundaries have been wrong
for some working convenience 
Music
It doesn't mean there is a total division
where one person should not focus notion to the other 
Music
In fact, the entire principle of internal integration states that
Explain the need for internal integration
Music
both
Music
the departments
Music
and the customer need to be seamlessly integrated 
Music
This seamless integration
Music
within a firm where
Music
Music
maybe the finance, the HR, the sourcing,
the IT all of them have to break down barriers and think as one single unit 
We have seen a supply chain maturity model
in the earlier modules 
Music
If you recollect,
Music
supply chain maturity
Music
in supply chains 
was shown having five levels 
Music
Level 1-
Music
Was the ad hoc phase where there was
absolutely no integration, absolutely no integration
Music
and then we saw level 2, and level 3,
Music
where
Music
Music
the boundaries between departments within a firm were broken down 
Music
Supply_chain_Management_10912
Music
the basic task
Music
in that particular module was
Music
to introduce the need for internal integration in the supply chain 
Two
Music
Unless the chain is internally integrated, meaning
you reach level 2 and level 3,
it's not going to be possible to have external integration,
Music
which is represented by level 4 and level 5 
Music
Supply_chain_Management_10927
Music
much of the supply chain work that's going on today in the business world
Music
is moving towards level 2 and level 3 
Music
And for this to integrate all the functions
Music
as especially in sharing of information,
Music
you definitely need the software to do it 
Music
And gone are the days when you had a software for accounts
and had a software for manufacturing,
Explain the role of an ERP
you had a software for HR
and each one is written in a different language runs on a different system 
Music
All these are called the legacy systems 
Music
We need a fully integrated system
Music
that can address the needs of the entire organization 
Music
And we are going to see that in the next video 
Music
Music
in internal integration 
manufacturing process integration 
Music
Learning outcomes 
Music
At the end of the session,
Music
the student must be able to
Music
one
Music
identify
Music
Music
points within a company
Music
which cause
integration problems 
Music
Two
Music
identify
Music
Dear learners,
information needs at these points,
which an ERP can provide to create integration 
Music
Consider the following case:
Music
You are a customer
Music
of a bakery
Music
that has been running in your neighborhood
Music
Music
for many years now 
Music
You regularly visit that bakery
Music
and you have a working relationship
Music
with the owner of the bakery 
Music
This bakery sells
before a supply chain is fully integrated,
Music
the usual stuff that any bakery sells 
Music
Cakes, pastries, buns,
Music
coffee, tea, all other kinds of snacks
Music
and
Music
cold and hot beverages of all kinds 
Music
Music
Now in your office
Music
for your meetings, you regularly place orders to this particular bakery
Music
for the refreshments that you serve the guests 
Music
You have been very happy with the bakery because one it's nearby
Music
and two
it is essential to first integrate
Music
And that means
Music
you have to have a safe place for keeping all that stock and make sure
Music
that it is kept the way it is supposed to be kept 
Music
The biscuits are in proper order,
the juice is in proper order 
Music
Usually they used to deliver all the products on time there was no complaint
Remember you need a refrigerator for a cold drink 
Music
So you need to place it for two hours there 
Music
See how much of problem you need, just because you have ordered early 
Music
That's one issue 
Music
Or
Music
or the people
you can have another solution 
Every five minutes,the bakery owner can keep calling you and say
here is the status of this order,
here is the status, now it's ready, is going to ship 
Music
Something like an Amazon tracking 
Music
But all of us know,
Music
that's a little foolish to do  Why? Because you have other priorities 
using the refreshments are not very finicky about what they eat 
This is just a side delivery 
Music
For any business to ask the person to continuously
supply information about the status of delivery
can sometimes be overwhelming for the customer 
Music
Or still
Music
they can communicate well in advance when you place the order,
he could immediately verify his stock and say,
But under stress,
Music
sorry sir, we do not have a stock of this,
Music
do ask them but I have the following alternatives and each one is as good 
Music
That would give you a head start
Music
and you can be confident
Music
that
this lack of integration in any supply chain
Music
your group of people who are coming for the meeting get precisely what they want 
Music
In all these cases,
Music
what you have seen is the regular process has broken down
Music
and the interdepartmental communication
Music
has taken a big
can cause
Music
beating 
Music
Each person supposing the bakery on or goes and asked the delivery boy,
Music
"why is it you didn't come and ask me?"
What do you think he is going to say? "I heard it that way" 
Music
Iam here new how do you expect me to know?
Music
Music
And believe it or not in most modern organizations,
Music
the same shifting of blame goes on why?
Music
Because
Music
every department works in a silo 
Music
Each department has their own norms 
There is absolutely no commonality or
critical disasters 
a common objective for all the departments together 
Music
What do you think this means?
Music
Lack of integration  Let us shift
Music
to a big organization 
Music
Let us say an organization making cars,
Music
Music
they have an engineering department,
Music
they have
Music
a machining department, they have an assembly,
Music
they have a quality department,
Music
they have a stores 
Music
You might end up supplying a totally wrong product to a totally wrong customer and
We have seen how the entire
Can you imagine the kind of information flowing around?
Music
The engineering department talks in a particular language
and makes a particular design 
Music
But when it comes to the machine shop,
Music
they find that certain components
do not fit the specifications that the engineering is done 
Music
the brand name can take such a huge beating
They have to make their own adjustments to make the product 
Music
Engineering would comply and saying that "you are not complying to my
standard operating procedure"
Music
then it's not possible to do so at all 
Music
And the worst place in any manufacturing environment is the assembly 
Music
Because
that will take many years to recover 
Music
once a good friend told me
Music
that assembly is the graveyard or the dumping ground for the mistakes
Music
of all the other departments in the factory,
Music
meaning everybody makes a mistake and we get caught 
Music
Why? Because we have to clean up all their mistakes 
Music
Music
If you go to the assembly line, you will find all sorts of discrepancies
Music
and a huge level of frustration 
Music

Music
How do you get rid of this?
Music
Remember, you are going to have hundred product lines 
For this entire integration process,
Music
It's an extremely complex issue 
Music
And the only way, but I have personally seen
Music
for getting rid of this situation is
Music
get everybody on to the same discussion board,
Music
have the problem discussed,
Music
Music
ask everybody to pitch in and come up with a collaborative solution 
Music
Unless all the departments start
Music
sitting together, talking to each other,
Music
you are never going to be able to sort out
Music
huge internal integration issues 
the bakery example can definitely be extended to regular supply chains 
Music
And
Music
this internal integration issue
Music
requires a lot of information 
Music
Whenever I have been to any workplace,
Music
I have always found the biggest difficulty is in getting the right kind of information 
Music
Music
Most of the information happens to be opinions of people, they are not facts 
And how do you think you are going to be able to get such facts?
For example,
Music
When do you have a production issue? When do you have a rejection?
Music
How many products had a problem last week?
Music
How many workers are having an issue making all this
And
Music
critical information, isn't it?
Music
And how do you think you are going to get it? Information, information, information!
Music
This leads to Information Technology 
Music
Not just any information technology, you need a complete system,
which circulates information
Music
Music
about the entire firm
Music
to whichever department request it 
Music
And
Music
this package
Music
comes under the name of 'Enterprise Resource Planning, or ERP' 
Music
what do you think can be the biggest help
order delivery process in the bakery
There are plenty of such packages in the marketplace 
Music
The most popular ones happened to be
Music
SAP and
Music
Oracle 
Music
These are the two most popular ERP packages 
Music
Music
That could have any number of good open source packages as well 
Music
Like
Music
Odoo
Music
or
Music
well you have Tiny ERP which was Odoo in the beginning 
Music
towards internal integration in supply chains?
You have
Music
Open Blue Labs from IBM labs,
Music
you have
Music
any number of GNU packages
Music
but remember being free packages, they are not having complete functionality 
Music
Music
Whatever the reason may be, ERP goes a long way in
providing information
Music
about the entire firm 
Music
It is called the transactional recording layer, it records all the transactions 
Music
Isn't giving you information but you have the transaction records 
Music
ERP is usually combined with some other packages,
This is a software solution,
Music
like
Music
CRM,
Music
Customer Relationship Management,
Music
or SRM, Supplier Relationship Management,
Music
or advanced planning systems,it tries to optimize your plans 
Music
Music
All these packages put together 
Music
Serve to break down the barriers
between different departments,
Music
so that
Music
resources can be planned more efficiently
Music
which is popularly called in today's
with the same final Goal 
Music
Namely,
Music
"Supplying the product or service to the customers
Music
at the right time,
Music
right place,
Music
Music
right cost
Music
to his
Music
full
satisfaction" 
Music
ERP when properly implemented,
Music
can lead to a beautiful,
language as
Music
monolithic
Music
behavior of the organization that works
like a music orchestra, everybody works to sync 
Music
And
Music
in case you need details about a particular process
Music
Music
ERP has it as well This feature is known as a Drill Down 
Music
It's lovely in concept,
Music
but I have rarely seen a firm
Music
which has a proper drill down
Music
and a bulk of the firms which have invested a
lot of money in all these ERP packages
Enterprise Resource Planning,
Music
Music
are still in their learning curve 
Music
Meaning they have not achieved the full,
Music
full objective of why they started the whole process 
Music
They are learning and they have gone great steps
Music
in using the ERP package
Music
Music
to minimize their inventory or minimize their losses or whatever 
Music
But
Music
they have not achieved the full objectives they set out to achieve 
Music
I have seen any number of these companies where
Music
their original objective was of 100% drill down for each process 
ERP  Let's go back to the bakery 
Music
Well,
Music
they have it up to the top management level,
but they can't go to the lower levels  Why?
Music
Because
Music
they haven't featured or customized it yet 
Music
Music
It's still a work in process 
Music
While enterprises resource planning software
Music
is great to work with,
Music
to actually use all the features available is a huge
Music
distance away 
Music
How do you think
Not too many firms have used it 
Music
And what does that mean?
Music
They still have a long way to go in getting fully internally integrated 
Music
Music
the problems could have been sorted out?
Music
How do you think the problems could have been avoided in the first place?
Music
Do you think the bakery could have handled it differently?
breaks down
Music
Or on the other hand,
Music
could you have handled it differently?
Music
In each case, the final customer was the ultimate sufferer 
Music
And
Music
its probably a loss of phase for you 
Music
Music
The foreign guests are not likely to appreciate the fact
Music
that the bakery made a careless mistake 
Music
This is going to cause a lot of strain
Music
in your mind as an organizer 
Music
You have to spend a lot of time thinking about
under
what to do when some supply fails, instead of focusing
Music
on the topic of discussion for the meeting 
Music
After all the meeting is far more important
Music
than what refreshments you get 
Music
Your entire time is wasted on making up and covering up the suppliers failures 
Music
Music
This set of failures has happened because
Music
your supplier was not internally integrated 
Now, consider a few solutions for the bakery 
Music
We will spend a little more time on the bakery because
its easy to extend what's going on to a regular firm 
Music
The processes are the same 
Music
specific conditions of stress 
What do you think you could have done to avoid the situation?
Music
One,
Music
you could have place an order two hours in advance 
Music
Why?
Music
If something goes wrong, you have sufficient time
to plan for an alternative

Matching supply chain with Products  Modern supply chains handle two
Play Station might dig deep into your pockets  You might be able
to buy 15 other jeans for the price of an in fashion Levi's,
but what is it that you would want the Levi's and why? Because
it's fashionable today  All the other jeans might not have much
value for your ego  We will call this emotional needs, it's not
want, it's to do with your esteem  These products are like
passing fads, meaning once the season is over, you are likely
to get these products at throw away in prices, deep discounts They
are perfectly functional is absolutely nothing wrong
in the quality of the product  And yet, they are given at throw
and responsive supply chains and match them with the right kind
away prices  This doesn't happen of the previous category we
discussed, like soap, or rice  Now, these products have to be sold
in the season  Otherwise, when you can basically pick them up
off the road  Now and these products, the manufacturer makes
a huge profit margin  Why don't they visit any retailer and ask
him the kind of margins they make? The margins are huge But
if something is not sold, the entire thing is going to be a
loss for the manufacturer  So here, Speak to the market is
critical  And the manufacturers have internal headache on
forecasting the demand for these products  It's impossible to
of product  Consider the product like soap, shampoo or rice 
ascertain and advance what the demand is going to be like, we
really don't know if it will sell in the market, or bomb in
the market  Take the Play Station for example  They had asked for
a certain number of PlayStations based on their demand forecast
and it was such a huge success that they did not have adequate
play stations to give in the market  See, they underestimated demand 
There have been cases where demand has been overestimated
example, Daewoo Matiz, it used to belong to the Korean
daewoo company  Now, GM has purchase it  Daewoo Matiz was
launched in India as a fully loaded car  They overestimated
How do you going buy such products?
demand, what do you think happened? The cars didnot sell  Such
products it's extremely difficult to estimate the demand,
and demand forecasting has to be a very carefully and
a continuously be done exercise  We have considered distinct two
kinds of products  The first kind of product has a low price
sells at a low margin, but the demand is steady  It's very easy
to forecast it with a good deal of accuracy  If something is not
sold at the end of the season, no big deal it will sell for the
same price  next season,
no issues  These are called
Does the price for these products change at all? What
functional
products  The second category of products
where
the prices are extremely high  It's always in fashion  The
profit margins are extremely large  But once out of fashion,
they are going to be sold at rock bottom prices  It's going to be
a total loss for the manufacturer  So, speak to the
market, catching the fashion,Proper demand forecasting are all
critical  And it's an eternal headache forecasting the demand 
Something is not sold the season next season, forget about it,
about your demand for these products? Do you consume more of
you're not going to be able to sell it  Such products are
called innovative products 
them at some points and less of them at some other points Is
your consumption based on some kind of fashion or trends
or is it based on
your day to day requirements?
Do you get huge discounts at the end of the season or does it
distinct kinds of products functional and innovative  Both
sell for the same price all the time? Now, the answer to all
these questions would be, come on! it is just a soap and a
shampoo  I use the same amount irrespective of what the market
does  It's my basic need  And I hardly pay extra for the soap or
shampoo  Yeah, I get a discount, By getting a free soap  It's
some other product once in a while, but the product itself is quite
a low value item  I bet, If a soap is not sold, by the end of
the season, the shopkeeper is going to sell it to me in the
beginning of the next season for the same price  He's not going to
reduce the price just because something did not sell in a
have distinct patterns on demand, pricing and certainty 
season  And all your soaps and shampoos do sell for higher
prices  Much of it is worth to sell at the same steady
price  Now, let's go to the side of the seller  Why don't you
visit a retailer and ask him the following questions  Ask him
what kind of margins he makes on the soap? Do you think he makes
a margin of 60% and 70% margins? But I would want you to go and
check out with him directly what kind of margins he makes on such
products, namely the soap, the shampoo and rice  Ask him if
there is any particular demand season where the demand suddenly
goes up and suddenly comes down  find out whether such products
They have to be handled with distinct supply chain
have huge cyclical variations in demand  Do you think these
products have a passing fad? Meaning, you use them now and
then later on, we don't want them  We're going to switch to
some other product  When you eat rice today, probably a switch to
some other product  You think it's going to happen? No,Not at
all  And do ask the seller what he does with the unsold stocks 
Let's say he has 50 kgs of rice, which he has not been able to
sell this particular season  What do you think he's going to
do? Is he going to dispose it of
at cost price saying,
configurations,namely efficient and responsive supply chains 
take it at discounted price? Or is he going to keep selling it to
you, irrespective of the season? Whether you sold it or not? Why
don't you want to ask him?
And finally,
do you think he's going to give you a discount just because it's
an older product? I think you should be asking the retailer on
all this  All the products that we have mentioned are
usually the economy products,
the prices are never high  I'm not implying that the prices are
rock bottom  But these prices are never high  They are not the
Learning objectives, One, understand functional and
premium charging products  These products are probably the
everyday use products,
You and I have, meaning we don't
care what the price is going to be so long as it's within our
own budget is a price band which is tolerable to all of us  And
that's usually at the lower end of the spectrum  These products,
we rarely compromise on the use, meaning that demand is always
steady  As long as we get them at the proper price ranges, They
are not going to compromise on them  We are not going to look
elsewhere  We are going to change them  We going to use them
innovative products  Two, characterize efficient and
the same  Now, these products, we usually buy them in bulk 
Meaning you need soap today  In order to go and buy one bar of
soap you're probably going to buy a big case of soap If you're
going to use for quite a while, same goes for ways or even
shampoo  We don't go and buy these products every day 
Meaning we try to get bulk discounts, we try to get package
offers, we try to do a lot of stuff where we can get a bulk of
the items for use over a certain period of time  Now, let us
consider a totally different category of products  Example,
a Sony play station or the Levi's jeans  Do you think they
responsive supply chains and match them with the right kind
are similar to the products  We have just mentioned? Absolutely
not  Then the Sony Play Station is launched  You have got
to get in then and there 
If you miss the season, you're too old  Meaning you get an
absolete product  The next Play Station is ready by them 
And does it sell for the low price? Well, I'm leaving it to
you to decide how many bars of soap can buy one Sony
Play Station  This is an example of a product where- One, the
prices are high and the margins are going to be high  It's a
fashionable product which last for a particular period of time 
of product  Learning outcomes  One, identify functional and
It's something to do with your image not your regular ones 
Like a soap is for your regular ones, but the Play Station is not
for your regular ones  The same goes for Levi's jeans  If
something is trending, let us say an acid washed jeans  If you
miss buying it during the season, the next season acid
wash is out of fashion  Buying it has no value for you 
Absolutely no use  Now, these products are always sold at a
premium  You never buy them in bulk  Now, in these products,
price is not an issue  You are willing to pay any amount of
money to get these into your possession  A Levi's or a
innovative products in real life supply chains  Two, apply efficient
The last video, we considered 2 different kinds of products 
has to be responsive , this whole process of matching the
right kind of product to the right kind of supply chain
configuration is known as supply chain fit 
jeans or Sony Play Station  It doesn't matter at all  Whether
the rate is 500 or 1000 or 1500 rupees, what matters is it teaches you
on time
these two are totally distinct supply chains, isn't it?
These 2 distinct supply chain philosophies have 2 different
configurations  They have been given specific names so that we
could probably have the right kind of supply chain or the
right kind of product  Consider supply chain configuration where
the cost of delivery of the product right from the topmost
player all the way down to the customer, is as low as it can
Functional and innovative , from your understanding of these
get  Here, the time taken for moment as a product from the
first supplier to the last customer
is pretty steady 
The volumes that move across the supply chain don't vary much,
maybe a little here and there but by and large, they are
steady  It's extremely easy to predict the flow of materials
meaning you can see exactly how much of material can flow at
what particular point of time, when is it likely to go up a
little here little there  By and large, you know what kind of
material was flowing across the supply
two kinds of products,
chain 
Here, there are hardly any information requirements 
Whatever information is required is so easy to predict that you
don't even want to ask for it  There is not much of a flow of
materials backwards from the customer back to the supplier 
Whatever reaches a place, whatever be the condition  It
doesn't go back, stays for  this Kind of supply chain
configuration is called an efficient supply chain  The word
efficiency means, the input resources to the supply chain
have been minimized  You use a minimum amount of resources to
do you think both the products should have
have the product or service delivered to the final customer 
It's the cost  These are extremely low cost supply chain 
That's what makes them efficient in the first place  The cost of
handling is so low that you can afford to charge low margins on
the products  On the other hand, consider a supply chain
configuration whereanything that the customer orders for is
delivered within
12 hours 
You can make any changes in the delivery configuration within
half
similar supply chains? Or should they be totally different? The
an hour this configuration will be addressed 
The hange time less than 20 minutes 
They always deliver on time
but usually comes at an extremely high cost  Here ,
supply chain cost is not an issue, absolutely not  What
matters is how quickly and how quickly can the product be
delivered to the customer  Here, there is a lot of product
replacement going on, and plenty of movement of materials back
down from the lower side of the supply chain
to the upstream processes 
objectives of both these equations have to be different 
The supply chain has an extremely volatile customer
demand  This demand has to be constantly updated and
constantly worked down  Most of the delivery that happens is so
unstructured that you can't be efficient  Half the time the
trucks don't get full  You can't wait for a tractor get full to
deliver  Why? Because the delivery is due  You can't say no 
My truck is half full Can you wait a day, I'll deliver it a
day later  That's not an option  These supply chains focus on
very-very high value products  so that these inefficiencies get
absorbed in the margins of the product  , this configuration
One, delivers a product consistently  Here, it
of supply chain where the entire focus is on maximizing customer
service, while neglecting costs to a certain extent, nobody can
totally neglect the costs but here costs are not an issue as
important issue that is as serving the customer in time and
hiring high margins somehow absorbs these extra delivery
costs  This kind of configuration is known as a
responsive supply chain  , a responsive supply chain and an
efficient supply chain are 2 ends of the supply chain
continuum  It's very difficult for a supply chain to be both
responsive and efficient  There's hardly any in fact ,
doesn't matter whether the product is late by a day or the
Responsive supply chains
obviously deal with a different category of products
when compared to an efficient supply chain  Considering what
you have done in the last video, can you guess which supply chain
should be used? Or which kind of product? No marks for guessing
the answer  It's a no brainer  Functional products, which are
low cost, steady demand Lower margins obviously require and
efficient supply chain  You can't have soaps being delivered
on demand  Supposing you do have a soap that's being delivered on
demand, it's going to be a premium  So, meaning the product
product is earlybird  What matters is what is the cost of
is no longer functional
and
be functional products have to be profitable only by means of
having an efficient supply chain  Innovative products on
the other hand, the margins are higher, obviously need a
responsive supply chain  Here,we observe the costs associated
with demand and certain
it is
with unsold stock with changing customer preferences all within
the extra margins that we charge  Here the supply chain
delivery to us  Whereas talking about a high end product like
Dear learners,welcome to this module on business models outsourcing 
what we saw till now
was an outsourcing complete verticals  But should we be
outsourcing the entire vertical in one shot? Would it not make
sense to keep certain critical portions of the vertical with us
and outsource only those parts which are either too irritating
to do or are beyond our competence, or can be done
better by someone else  After all, nobody can be competent in
your line of business  Maybe in portions they could fit in your
entire business model an entire vertical  It doesn't make sense
to outsource the whole thing, although a few firms are very
What is it? You are going to do?
very, very successfully 
Not everyone can be a Walmart,
everyone can be a Nike or a Everyone can be an Apple  We are
going to have a shoe company which say outsources the
transportation, we could have a laptop manufacturing company
which outsources the development, but maintains their
own distribution centers, you could have a retail chain, which
probably specializes in making their own products and supplying
it  , all these are examples of outsourcing using the product
architecture methodology  In part architecture methodology
What are the dishes, you're going to have?
affirmed as all those activities where it is really good at this
is called core competence  , if somebody has a core competence
in a certain level of skill, these skills are not outsourced 
The companies zealously guards them because that is the source
of their competitive advantage  , We have seen what is to be
outsourced  You could follow the product architecture route or
entire vertical outsourcing route  , we are moving to
another dimension of outsourcing  How to decide
whether you should outsource yes or a no  What do you think should
be the criteria for deciding whether you outsource or do
Will you make sandwiches at home?
something yourself? Well, we go back to the oldest secret in
business, namely, what is the cost? , supposing you decide
to make a product or service, what do you do? You need to have
a facility, you need to invest on people, you need to train
them, you need to get your equipment, you need to pay for
all your overhead, you need to pay a licensing costs  And most
importantly, you need to manage your people  Somebody is on leave,
somebody has not done proper work  It's a headache that you
need to manage, and what comes out the product or service  ,
This is called, the agency cost where you need to run a system
Or
to get an output because you own it  On the other hand, supposing
you just decide to buy and sell  Are you three? No, no, you're
not  Why? Because you need to identify a proper supplier, who
should give you a proper quality product, he should be
consistent, he should give it to you at the right price, he
should be able to consistently deliver and he should not
deliver the product to some other competitor of yours just
because he gives them 10% more, meaning he should be loyal and
have a long term relationship with you  , All these costs
associated with maintaining an external supplier are called
will you visit a hotel?
transaction costs  Common sense is this  Supposing your agency
costs are lower than your transaction costs I would make 
But on the other hand, if my transaction cost is lower, than
the agency cost, I would outsource, simple  Ofcourse, there
are so many other variables which can override the cost
cancellation  For example, supposing there is a sensitive
project like making of battle tanks, even though it's costlier
to make it yourself, for security reasons, I wouldn't
outsource it,
I would rather make it at a higher cost 
Or
In the same way, there are so
many other variables, but by and large, a business decision is
made
on cost 
For a bulk of the supply chains out there, you can very well use
this simple equation to decide
when you're going to make or buy 
The decision rule is is the cost of making less or is the cost of
buying less  Whichever is less, goahead with it  If the passage
of time Changes equation, we should be open minded enough to
Would you rather order something on the latest apps like swiggy
be able to switch  We shouldn't be stuck onto something just
because you like it 
You know, but you're running a business 
I'm giving you some work to do 
List out the things at home, which you make yourself
and the list of things you normally buy 
For the last 5 years, how many items have you switched
from making, to buying and from buying to making? Why did
you make the shift from make to buy or buy to make? Do list out
all the reasons because this is the beginning of your
and over how will you take a decision on which alternative you
understanding of
outsourcing 
are going to choose? What are the priorities you will consider
to decide on 1 of the 3 options given or would you want
Each firm has to decide on how, why and when to outsource  Here,
to have a combination of these options, meaning a little bit on
swiggy, a little bit made at home and maybe go to the hotel
for something else  This example of your wanting to have dinner
is highly simplistic  But don't underestimate the example  This
is precisely what happens in usual supply chain  Supply Chain
Management is called the "big picture of a business"  We don't
care too much about the details, but we are interested in what's
going on
overall 
And our example
this topic is explained in a simple standardized approach  
fits this particular scenario of factly Very same decisions are
made in each and every supply chain and what are these
decisions? What are you going to outsource? When are you going to
outsource? How are you going to outsource? It could be a product or
service?
Are you going to outsource
a portion of your process? Or are you going to outsource an
entire process? How are you going to make that decision? And
also, in case you outsource, what kind of relationship do you
think you're going to maintain with your suppliers? All
Learning objectives  1  Explain the maker by decision  2 
suppliers want to have similar relationships? Think about it 
When we outsource, we can think about it in 2 different ways 
1, entire verticals, the other portions of the business 
,
When we think of verticals, any business can be classified into
3 major verticals  Verticals number 1, customer
relationship, vertical number 2, supply chain management,
and vertical number 3, product and vision and service
innovation  ,The theory of outsourcing says, you could
outsource 1 or 2 of these verticals,
Explain the strategic sourcing metrics  Learning outcomes  At
the most 
You cannot outsource all the 3, then you aren't in
business Anyway, you become somebody else's business  It's
great to be able to do all the 3 verticals yourself 
But in case you're
cash strapped and you don't have the resources,
it always makes sense to outsource
1 or 2 of the verticals  consider Nike  If you go to the
factory where Nike is being made, could be the shoes, could
be the jacket any of the products  Does it belong to
the end of this sessions the students should be able to, 1 
Nike? Not a chance  Somebody is doing it for them  This Nike
is packaged in this factory
and it is shipped with the stock points 
Does Nike own the Shipping, transport, not at all  ,, What
are the stocking points? Does Nike own them? No, they don't?
From the stock point it goes to the retailer 
Does Nike have its own retailers?
No  The third party?
Then what are the sign is Nike doing? Someone is making it, some
one is shipping it, someone is selling it, but Nikes collecting
identify various avenues to outsource in a real life supply
the money  What do you think they're doing? They are
designing the product  The copyrights for the product stays
with them, meaning the outsourcer supply chain, they
outsource the customer relationship,
but they have kept the
product innovation and design 
The same strategy is being followed by Apple, could be their
iPhone or their iPad Its all
the same 
, We could consider on the
chain  2  Use appropriate strategies to outsource the
other sid, another example 
Walmart  Walmart specializes in supply chain  They don't give too
much of importance to the other 2  They do have the customer
relationship  And they also have a little bit of product
innovation  But a bulk of the products are third party
products  You do get an in house brand called the Walmart brand,
but then in innovated some supplier does it and gives it to
them  So, you can see that Walmart has outsourced the
product, but they have kept the supply chain in   Look at
firms like Amazon  Do they have anything, any shop? No, it's been
right kind of product  Let us assume you are hungry and you
outsourced  What do they do? They have a huge focus on
customer relations  Everything else has been outsourced 
Although they do have some fulfillment centers where Amazon
employees do work, a bulk of the supply chain has been
outsourced  you can very clearly see that if you need to
outsource you could divide a business into the 3
verticals and outsource 1
or 2 of them, depending on
how good you are in the other vertical, which can make up for
outsourcing these 2,
want to eat something 
Till now we have been seeing
based comparing various suppliers, and have a proper
agreement so that you get all your products on time  Now, the
last quadrant, this is the strategic quadrant, the purchase
volume is very high 35 to 40%, 35 to 40% purchasing, but the
number of components is just two to 5%  What does it tell you
though, the number of components considered the low purchase value
is extremely high  Meaning if you're not careful here, this
can affect your bottom line, with time  So you can see how this
particular analysis has a parallel to the ABC
classification  It's not bad, but it's similar  Here you can
classify your suppliers is the supplier grid, the supplier
see that high value is usually lower volumes and low value is
usually higher volumes for the comparison and there 
matrix  Which you can see now on your screen  Now, this
particular matrix has two axis  The horizontal axis talks about
the value of your purchase, and the vertical axis talks about
the supplier risk meaning how certain about the supply are you
Is the supply like to be, likely to be disrupted  If the supply
is disrupted, do you have an alternative  If not, it is a
risky supply  Now, you can see that the horizontal axis is
divided into low value and high value  The vertical axis is
divided into low suppliers, and high suppliers  Let us have a
what to outsource and how to outsource  Now, let us shift to
look like each of these quadrants separately  Each of
these quadrants is a totally different kind of supplier and
requires a different kind of strategy  The first quadrant
we're going to consider is low purchase value, and low supply
risk  Now, these people are not very important to your business
because you're not buying too much from
them anyway 
And also, they are very loyal to you, meaning they depend on you 
So, you really don't need to bother much about them  Just go
ahead and subcontract in the usual way  You don't need to
another topic and outsourcing  Let us say you're outsourcing an
spend too much
time on it 
In case the supplier doesn't do well, you always have
alternatives  And he is not likely to miss out on supplies
because he depends on us  Okay, so these people, we use
something called routine products to classify them  These
products are formed routine products, and any general systems
of contracting should do  Here, the supply risk is still low,
but we're purchasing a large value of our outsource products
from the suppliers  Now, that means you have to be a little
item to supplier A  Now, are you going to treat all your
more careful, you can just subcontract it  These goods are
called leverage goods  Now, since we buy a large amount of
goods from a single supplier, he depends on us  He probably
cannot find another customer who is willing to give him such a
large business  You could definitely ask him for a big
discount, he is going to upload  So, what we do here is
competitive bidding  Get three four people to bid so you can
get the lowest price  Remember, he depends on us  Let's move to
the third quadrant  The third quadrant is low purchase value,
but high suppliers  We don't buy much from the supplier But they
suppliers the same? Or do you have a differentiated strategy?
are not the reliable  Let's take an example  When there was a huge
tsunami in Japan,
a very small component was supplied by Fujitsu to companies
like Toyota, and Mitsubishi  And this was just a chip, which is
used in the engine to ignite the diesel engines  And the petrol
engines, we don't have carburetors anymore, you know,
this is multi-point fuel injection, and the chip factory
was destroyed  And what happened? Toyota had to stop
production for two weeks  They got alternate supply from
somewhere else  And the value of the chip is very small  But if
How do you think a supplier can be rated? We do have a vendor
it's not reliable, operations can take a hit  Now, these products
are called leverage products  Where we depend on the supplier
but the value is not much  He doesn't depend on us because
he's probably supplying 100 other people  So here, what you
need to do is Have a proper performance based contract
meaning you need to put in a lot of effort, need to do a lot of
reviews, even though the purchase volume is very low  Finally, we
move to the last quadrant, this quadrant is a very dicey
quadrant  We have huge purchase volumes on one hand and on the
other hand,
rating process but no, this is different  Remember this is
supply risk is also very high  So that
means something goes wrong here the entire business can take beating  So,
these are basically collaborative supply chains  You
need to sit and talk to these people, you need to put in a lot
of your effort you need to exchange resources, you need to
regularly talk about how to improve performance and all of
that  This grid was analyzed by a good friend Professor Janat
Shah 
He discovered the following
answer the question quadrant one routing products  Now as the
supply chain  In supply chain, we need to have a proper strategy
bulk of the Indian firms The purchase volume was between 15
and 20%  And the percentage of parts, the number that was 80
to 85%  and a large amount of this routine, what does this tell
you, you could very well outsource 80% of your products
in a routine way without bothering about, are you going to
have an issue wether he is critical to you he is not 
If you go to the next quadrant,
where the volumes are a little higher the one to the right 
They found that the purchase volume was between 35% and 40%
of value and the percentage of the components that means the
on how to deal with different categories of suppliers? And one of
number of components having this kind of a characteristic
was between two and 5%  Meaning you could count the number of
parts which you really need to leverage from your supplier of
bulk or general but this is special  As we go on to the third
one, the bottleneck one meaning the value is lower, but the
supplier risk is higher, they found that the purchase volume
was between five and 8%  And the percentage of the parts was the
number that is was between 10 and 15%  That means 10 to 15% of
the products are likely to cause a headache, you have to be very
careful and look for our alternates our total performance
the easiest methods that clearly tells you a strategy on how to
Hello viewers, I'm Dr  B Sudhakar Director, Department of MBA
A facility that focuses on the development and process
technologies, creating new products, processes and
technologies for the entire network is known
as the lead facility  Next, we look at the technological
factors, new technologies have been emerging  This has resulted
in a few high capacity production locations with
economies of scale  If these facilities have lower fixed
costs, then many facilities like the one planned and established
to get the cost advantage to serve the market are done  But
if the fixed costs of setting up these facilities is high, it is
cost of the supply chain as well as satisfy the service level
advisable to set up few facility locations which may serve the
market  The impact of macro economic factors come next 
Tariffs and tax incentives are important factors under this 
Duties which have to be paid by a company when the products
produced by them are moved to the market across the city,
state or borders  Known as tariffs  When the tariff is low
in a country, the company sets up the facility to manufacture
the products to sell the markets across the borders  But if the
tariff is high in a country companies set up manufacturing
plants within the country to serve the local market  To save
requirements of each and every member in the supply chain to
on duties countries encourage firms to set up the
manufacturing facility in specific areas by providing an
incentive to them by the way of reduced taxes and lower tariffs 
They expect those companies to focus on production for
exporting the products  Similarly, exchange rate and
demand risk have an influence on the location decision  Supply
chains that serve the global market are affected by the
fluctuation in exchange rates  This has a significant impact on
the profits of the supply chain  Similarly, when there is an
economic slowdown in the global market, it has an impact of
meet the expectation of the customer  The learning
Indian industries  The demand for the product reduces 
Companies which are highly flexible to the demand, adjust
the manufacturing facility to manage the situation  When the
demand increases, flexible companies meet the demand with
extra capacities they can create  The next factor is
political factor  Members of the supply chain prefer to locate
their facilities in a country where it is investment
friendly and have a well defined system for commerce and
industry  They also expect the policies of the government to be
simple and clear, with faster process of approving for setting
objectives of this module are- To discuss the role of facility
up the location facility  Next comes the infrastructure
factors, availability of land with other factors of production
like labor trust facility skilled manpower, and local
government support are important infrastructure factors affecting
the facility network design decision, one has to consider
these factors and decide on locating a facility in that
place  Competitive factors play an important role in identifying
the best possible location, competitive strategy, their
size, and location are to be considered when designing the
supply chain networks  When colocation of the facility with
decisions in a supply chain, to understand the factors
the competitor benefits the company, they locate themselves
closer and get the benefit  Next factor is the customer response
time  When customers can wait for a longer response time, the
company can plan to have a few facility locations and can
increase the capacity of location whereas when a customer
wants a faster response time, the companies have increased the
required number of facilities in the network  To satisfy the
customer requirement, this results in increasing inventory
costs  In this edition, we have discussed the importance of
facilities decision in a supply chain and the factors affecting
influencing network positions in a supply chain, to discuss the
the facility network decision  In the next edition, we will
discuss the impact of the network decision on supply chain
costs and the framework for the facility decision network

framework for network design decisions in the supply chain, to
discuss the various methods of location planning in a supply
chain  The learning outcomes would be an understanding of the
role of facility decisions in a supply chain and understanding
in Hindustan College of Arts and Science converter  Today the
of the factors influencing the network decisions in a supply
chain and understanding of the framework for network design
decisions in a supply chain and to understand the different
methods of location planning  Let us first understand the role
of facility decision in supply chain  Supply chain facility
decision deals with the process of identifying the location of
manufacturing, storage and transport related facilities of
the supply chain and the allocation of the capacity of
various members with their roles in the supply chain  It is also
known as the supply chain network design decision  The
topic of discussion is facility decisions and location planning
network design affects all the members of the supply chain as
well as the role of each facility  The decision is highly
significant, as it determines the flexibility of the supply
chain in the current dynamic market condition  The facility
location decision is capital intensive, which will impact the
supply chain performance 
A good facility decision will always
help the supply chain to be responsive,
as well as be cost effective  Capacity allocation decisions to
each facility of the supply chain will have a significant
in a supply chain 
impact of its performance  When we allocate too much capacity to
a particular location in our supply chain, it may result in
under utilization of the facilities, which may result in
higher cost  Similarly, when we allocate too little capacity to
a particular location, it may result in poor responsiveness of
the facility of the supply chain and it may increase the cost of
logistics  From this, we can understand that allocation of
supply sources and markets to facilities have a significant
impact on the supply chain performance in meeting the
customer demand  Hence, the facility decision in a supply
Introduction to supply chain 
chain will have a significant impact on its performance as
they determine the supply chain configuration and the
constraints in which the inventory transportation and
information can be used effectively in decrease the
supply chain cost as well as increase the responsiveness of
the supply chain  Let us now look into the factors which
influence the facility network design decision  Network design
decision plays a significant role in determining the
distribution network for moving products from the supplier point
to the customer point in the supply chain  It is the key
Supply chain management is the set of activities involved in
driver of the overall profitability of a firm in the
supply chain because it affects both the supply chain cost and
the customer experience directly designing an appropriate 
Distribution network will help us to achieve the supply chain
objectives that is lower supply chain cost and high
responsiveness  Strategic technological, infrastructural,
competitive, macro economical, political, logistical and
operational factors influence the network design decision of
the facilities in the supply chain  , Let us discuss each
factor independently, it has start with the strategic
the process of efficiently integrating the suppliers,
factors  A firm's competitive strategy has a significant
impact on the facility network design decision in the supply
chain  A company which focuses on the cost leadership can plan
to find the lowest cost location for creating the manufacturing
facility, even if the location is far away from the markets
they are serving Similarly, a company which focuses on risk
responsiveness to demand can plan to locate the facility
closer to the market and can select a high cost location,
which may allow them to react quickly to the changing market
needs  The facilities can be classified based on the possible
manufacturers, warehouses and stores  Supply Chain distributes
strategic roles, they play in a supply chain and offshore
facility, which tends to be the low cost production facility for
export production serves the role of being a low cost supply
source for markets which are located outside the country  A
facility where the cost of production is low for the global
market, place as the source facility for the global network 
This facility has the advantage of lowest production cost with
the required infrastructure and skilled manpower  A
facility is created in a particular place of a region
where it gets the benefit of tax incentives, tax benefits and
the products manufactured at the right quantities to the right
local content requirement is known as a server facility of
the region and supplies to the market  Tariff barriers and
logistic cost to supply the region from elsewhere will be
high, and hence the facilities serves the requirement of the
region  Contributer facility is a regional production facility,
which focuses on product customization, process
improvements, product modification and development to
serve the market of that region  And outpost facility is a
regional production facility, which uses the local skills that
may exist within the region to satisfy the market requirements

cost and the framework of the facility design network decision
for supply chain  In the next edition, we will discuss the
analytical methods in evaluating the locations for facility
decisions for a supply chain  Thank you
When the number of facilities planned is increased, the
inventory cost also increases  Therefore, the companies should
analyze the requirement of inventory, location of facility,
requirement of transport facility and the facility costs
while designing the facility network for the supply chain 
The transportation cost also has an impact, the cost of sending
material per unit tends to be higher than the costs of
bringing material into the facility  Because incoming lot
sizes are always larger than the outgoing large sizes at one
point of time  When we increase the number of warehouse
facilities decision in a supply chain and the factors
locations at different places, which are closer to the market,
it decreases the average distance to the customer and
makes the outbound transportation distance lesser
when compared to the total distance traveled by the
product  This results in reduced transportation costs when the
company plans and achieves the economies of scale  Key in
inbound transportation, it is advisable to increase the number
of facilities which decreases the total transportation costs 
We also have to understand that the inbound lot sizes decrease,
increasing the number of facilities will increase the
affecting facility network decision 
total transportation costs 
Facility cost 
Facility cost is directly proportionate to the number of
facilities created 
Therefore, the companies in the supply chain has to determine
the optimum number of facilities required to meet the requirement
that minimizes the total logistics cost  If a company has
the objective of reducing the response time to its customers,
then it may plan to establish more number of facilities beyond
the optimum number of facilities
In this edition, we will discuss the impact of the network design
required  This decision
can be implemented only if the supply chain manager is
confident that this decision will increase the revenue of the
supply chain  , let us look into the framework for facility
network design decision  The process of deciding the facility
network design decisions can be divided into 4 phases  Phase
1 focuses on the supply chain strategy towards facility
decision  Phase 2 focuses on the analysis of the factors of
regional facility and its configuration  Phase 3
focuses on identifying the desirable sites for the
decision on supply chain cost and the framework for the
facility  And phase 4 focuses on designing the location
choices for the facility  1, which is the process of
designing a supply chain strategy  In this phase, a clear
understanding of the company's competitive strategy to meet the
customer requires of the supply chain is needed  The supply
chain managers then forecast the global competition and
determines the competition in each market, whether it is
global or local, they should also have an understanding of
the constraints
on the availability of capital 
facility design network decision for supply chain  The
This will help them to determine whether the growth can be
accomplished by acquiring existing facilities or to build
new facility or partner with someone to satisfy the customer
requirements  Once they determine this, the supply chain
manager formulates his strategy to design the facility location
decision 
Phase 2
comprises of defining the regional facility configuration 
In this phase, the supply chain manager has to forecast the
demand by country which will include a measure of the size of
distribution network design effects the following supply
the demand and the requirement of the customers across
different countries  This will help them to identify whether
the customer needs a homogeneous or heterogeneous  If the needs
are homogeneous, it is suggested having large number of
consolidated facilities  But if the needs are heterogeneous,
then which vary across countries, it is suggested
having smaller localized facilities  Supply Chain
managers should analyze the various factors for local
production, economies of scale and decide the need to locate
the facility closer to or far from the competitors facility 
chain costs, logistics cost and facility cost  Logistic cost and
Phase 3, which is the process of selecting a set of
desirable potential sites  This phase focuses on silver
Selecting the set of desirable sites
for the facility to be located
within the region  The selection of potential site depends on
various factors like infrastructure availability,
availability of suppliers, transportation services,
communication facility, utilities, warehouse facility,
availability of skilled workforce, workforce turnover,
and community receptivity to business and industry to support
facility costs depends on the number of facilities planned
supply chain requirements  Based on these factors, the potential
sites have to be selected  Phase 4, where we decide the choice
of locations in this phase the objective is to select the best
possible location from the selected potential sites  The
capacity of each facility selected will also be determined
the location is selected based on the various costs Namely
logistics cost, facility cost, taxes, tariffs, and the expected
profit it could earn which will maximize the total profits of
the supply chain  In this edition, we have discussed the
impact of the network design decision on the supply chain
their location and the capacity needed for the supply chain 
In the last edition, we have discussed the impact of the
same regardless of the location where the goods are produced,
then the total revenues can be eliminated from consideration,
and the potential locations can be compared on the basis of
their total costs  By using breakeven analysis, we can find
a location that has the lowest total cost for a given volume
range 
The following steps
are to be followed in using breakeven analysis for the
facility location decisions 
For each location, we have to determine its fixed
which is known as
costs and variable cost per unit  On a graph, we have to
plot the total costs for each location against a range of
annual production volume  The objective is to find out the
location which has the lowest total cost or specific volumes
of production  To find out this, we use the breakpoints are the
total cost curves The total cost curves of all location will
intersect each other  The intersection of the total cost
curves of various locations are known as the breakpoints  From
this, we have to identify the lowest cost curve which is
formed by the cost curves of various locations  , drop a
GIS  Let us discuss
perpendicular line from the break points of each lowest cost
curve  This will give us a range of volumes for which various
locations will be suitable  Let us consider an example, 4
different locations A B, C and D are considered for the facility
location decision  The fixed costs and variable costs are
given   Let us assume that the quantity demanded as 10,000
units using this quantity, we have to calculate the total cost
for each location as given below  Location A, the total cost is
3, 60,000 , location B, the total cost is
4,00,000 , location c total cost is 3,50,000 ,
one by one  The Factor Rating Method 
location D total cost is 5,50,000 for producing 10,000
units  Using the about data, we draw the graph  The graph drawn
is given for your kind reference,
we can visualize the intersection
of the total cost curves which is known as the breakpoints and
is denoted by
P1 ,P2
P3 and P4  P1 is the intersection of the total cost
curve of location A and location d  P2 is the intersection of
the total cost curve or location v And location c  P3 is the
In this method, the area's location alternatives are
intersection of the total cost curve of location A and location
b, P4 is the intersection of the total cost curve of location
A and location C  From this, we can analyze that the lowest
total cost curve is formed with the help of the total cost
curves of location B from the initial stage of quantity till
they break point P2 say, 0 to 5000 units  From this
breakpoint P2 to P4, for the lowest cost curve is formed with
the cost curve of location c say from 5000 units to 11,000 units
and from the break point P4 the lowest cost
curve is formed by the cost curve of location A ,say 11,000
evaluated by rating the relevant factors  The
units to 16,000 units  , This analysis helps us to find which
location is suitable for different quantities to be
having or move across the supply chain as mentioned in the
graph  The center of gravity method  The center of gravity
method is a mathematical technique, which is used to
identify the best possible location for facility decisions 
It identifies the location, which is equidistant from all
the members of the supply chain, so that the supply chain cost is
minimized  Supply Chain costs will depend on several factors
such as the weight of the product, the quantity to be
steps involved in this method are 
supplied, the distance to be traveled, and the speed at which
it must travel
to satisfy the requirement of the customer 
This method assumes that there is a linear relationship between
the distribution cost and the distance and quantity shipped 
This method
makes use of a map with the coordinate systems to identify
the coordinates of a central location, relative to all other
location which will be cost effective  The Geographical
Information System  The Geographical Information System
Step 1, determine the list of most relevant factors needed in
is an important tool, which is used to analyze the location
decision or manufacturing our service industries  It is a
computerized system which can store, relate and display the
data collected from a particular geographical location 
Geographic Information system maintains the databases of
geographical information of all places in the global
environment which helps to analyze the various factors of
locating a facility decision and such as the best possible
location  Retailers use this Geographical Information System
to identify the best possible location to serve the customers 
the location  Step 2, determine the rating of each
In this edition we We have discussed the different
analytical methods available in evaluating the location decision
for designing the facility decision of a supply chain 
factor on a scale of 1 to 5, based on its importance,
where 1 being low and 5 being high  Step 3, rate
network decision on the supply chain cost and the framework for
each location on a scale of 1 to 10 for each factor,
where 1 being low and 10 being high 
Then, step 4,
calculate the rated points for each location by multiplying the
factor rating and the location rating, which has been gotten
step two and step three respectively 
Step 5,
calculate the total score for each location by summing up the
scores calculated in the previous step 
Step 6,
the facility design a pub decision for a supply chain  In
Select the site that has the maximum number of scores total
scores 
This is the process
involved in identifying the best possible location using the
factor rating method  The next method is the breakeven
analysis,
cost volume profit analysis 
Our breakeven analysis helps us to understand the relationship
between total cost and total revenue of particular location 
Based on the total cost and total revenue, we can calculate
this edition, we will discuss the analytical methods in
the point from which profits generate for a particular
location  When comparing several potential locations, we can
calculate the profit of all locations and choose the best
location which earns more profit at an earlier stage onward  The
following steps are to be followed in using breakeven
analysis for the location decision 
For each location, we have to
determine the fixed cost and variable cost per
unit 
On a graph, we have to plot the total cost
evaluating the locations for facility decisions of a supply
for each location against a particular
quantity of volume 
Then, determine the revenue for the capacity plant  The
objective is to find out the breakeven point of various
locations to make the facility planning decision  The total
cost curves of all location will intersect the revenue curve to
keep the volume of breakeven for each location  From this, we have
to identify the best possible location
for a quantity plan 
Let us consider an example 
chain  The analytical methods for evaluating the locations are
4 different locations A, B, C, and D considered for the
facility location decision  The fixed
costs and the variable costs
and the revenue per unit are given below 
Let us assume that the quantity demanded is 10,000 units  If the
price per unit is rupees 70, we can calculate the total revenue
for this quantity using the quantity we have to calculate
the total cost for each location and the total revenue as given
below  Location A fixed cost is 2,50,000 , variable cost
per unit is leveled, quantity demanded is 10,000  Total
given below  Decision making tools can be used to select the
variable cost is 1,10,000  The total cost is 1,60,000
and the total revenue earned is 7,00,000 
Similarly, for location B, the fixed cost is 1,00,000 , variable
cost per unit is 30 ,quantity is 10,000 units, total variable
cost is 3,00,000  The total cost is 4,00,000 and the total
revenue remains same as 7,00,000  Location C , the fixed
cost is 1,50,000 variable cost per unit is 20, quantity is
10,000 the total variable cost is 2,00,000, the total cost is
3,50,000 and the revenue stands at 7,00,000 
Location D, the fixed cost is 2,00,000, variable cost per unit
best possible location  The most popular and commonly used ones
is 35, the quantity demanded is 10,000  , The total variable
cost is 3,50,000 and the total cost is 5,50,000
and the total revenue earned is 7,00,000 
By calculating this,
we will be able to determine the break even point 
Using the about data, let us draw the graph  Let us have
quantity in x axis and the cost in Y axis  In x axis 1 unit is
equal into thousands of units in Y axis one unit is equal into
thousands of rupees  The graph drawn is given for your current
reference We can visualize the intersection of the total cost
are factor rating method, breakeven analysis, center of
curves with the total revenue curve, which is known as the
breakeven point and it is denoted by p1, p2, p3
and P four p one is the breakeven point for location B 
P2 is the breakeven point for location c  P3 is the
breakeven point for location A and P4 is the breakeven
point for location D 
From this,
we can analyze the breakeven quantity for various locations
which will help us in making the facility location decision  Using
the same method, if we assume that the revenue per unit is the
gravity method and geographical Information System

the transportation cost per unit decreases 
This is also known as the tapering principle in transportation 
These two principles are used during the evaluation process of various
transport alternatives in a supply chain 
The goal of the supply chain manager is to maximize the size of the load to be shipped
and the distance to be shipped at the lowest cost
to meet the expectation of the customer in terms of their service expectations 
Let us now look into the participants of the transportation process 
The participants are the shipper or the consignor,
the consignee, the carriers and agents,
to the right locations and at the right time
the government, internet and the public 
Let us now look one by one 
Shipper or the consigner: The organisation or the person
who wants to transport the goods from one place to the another place
is known as the shipper or consignor 
Consignee:The party who receives the product through transportation
at the destination is known as the consignee 
Carrier or agents: Carrier is an organization
who is into the business of moving the goods from one place to another 
Carriers coordinate the pick
in order to minimize the total cost of the supply chain
and delivery of products to the customers point in addition to the movement of goods 
Brokers and agents are intermediaries
who act as agents for the carrier
to facilitate capacity and shipping requirements
to the carriers  Government:
Government plays a major role in transportation 
It takes the responsibility of creating the transport
infrastructure across the country
to enable the economy to grow  Sometimes they are also involved in
the transportation of goods 
as well as satisfy the service level requirements
They frame the regulations on the movement of goods
and govern the process of transportation across the country 
Internet: The recent development in
information technology and communication technologies,
the transport industry has been able to widen
their scope of business and services across the globe 
Capacity matching and shipment requirements are managed online
through internet resulting in more and effective businesses 
Information sharing across the members of the supply chain
regarding the transportation through the network has helped
of each and every member in the supply chain
the members of the supply chain to increase their performance 
Similarly, the real time visibility of the movement of goods
has helped the scheduling and capacity planning of the members
across the supply chain  Public:
Public plays a vital role in determining the growth of the transportation system 
The public create the demand for the products
which is translated across the supply chain
resulting in transportation of goods across the supply chain 
In this process, the public expect the industry to do the process
keeping in mind and environment and safety standards,
to meet the expectations of the customer 
so that they do not affect the society 
They also expect the cost of transportation to be minimum
as they will get the benefit while purchasing  In this edition,
we have discussed the role of transportation
and the principles of transportation in a supply chain 
In the next edition, we will discuss the different modes of transportation
and the transport economies in a supply chain

Introduction of transportation:"Moving of goods from the point of origin
to the point of destination across the supply chain
through its members is known as transportation "
It is an important driver for the supply chain
because the goods produced are rarely consumed in the same location 
Role of transportation in supply chain management 
The role of transportation in logistics has changed with a wide variety of
Presenting you this module on 'Transportation
transport alternatives and with a wide range of
value added service to support the supply chain 
Private transport companies have become part of the supply chain
and third party logistics companies
offer a wide variety of services like product sorting, sequencing,
and customized freight delivery to improve the efficiency of the supply chain 
Advancement in technology has improved
the services of the logistics with real time visibility of
tracking the vehicles using GPRS systems
and the integration of delivery systems through internet 
and Warehousing Decisions in a Supply Chain' 
Development of an integrated transport management system
has improved the product delivery
and reduce the inventory and material handling,
resulting in reduced transportation costs
and improved value of transportation for the supply chain 
Let us now discuss the transport functionality 
Transportation is the backbone of an economy 
Improved transportation infrastructure helps the economy to grow 
Transportation is an important element of logistics 
It helps the supply chain in the movement of products and storage of goods 
Introduction to supply chain 
Movement of products from the suppliers
to the customers across the supply chain
has become the primary value proposition of transportation in a supply chain 
Its performance is based on the time, cost
and the impact on the environment 
Today, the developments in information technology
have significantly improved the access to data on the movement of the transport
and the time of delivery, which helps the supply chain
to plan the exact time of delivery to the customers 
On an average, the transportation cost is about 30% of the total logistics cost 
supply chain management is the set of activities
We understand that transportation is a non value adding activity,
hence,the focus of the supply chain
is to reduce the cost of transportation to decrease the total supply chain cost 
Transportation industry is the largest consumer of fuel
and oil across the globe 
Efforts have been on to bring in fuel efficient vehicles 
Which are environment friendly
as they affect the environment through air pollution and noise pollution 
Storage of products during transportation
is considered as an option when there is a total cost advantage
involved in the process of efficiently integrating the suppliers,
to the supply chain and or when it improves the supply chain responsiveness 
It may be also considered as the best option
when there is diversion of products during the transit 
Supply chain managers use transportation
to improve their responsiveness and and their overall performance 
Transportation principles 
Transportation principles are two  One the economy of scale
and second the economy of distance 
Economy of scale is in transportation is referred to the reduction in cost
per unit of weight transported in relation
manufacturers, warehouses and stores 
to the increase in lot size of shipment done 
For example, when a truck full load
shipment utilizes the entire capacity of the truck,
the cost per unit of load transport, transported gets reduced 
But when we utilize only part of the entire capacity of the truck,
the cost per unit of load transported gets increased 
Economy of distance in transportation
is referred to the reduction in transportation cost per unit of weight
in relation to the distance mode for that quantity of shipment 
When the distance mode increases for a given volume of goods,
Supply chain distributes the products, manufactured at the right quantities
Supply_chain_Management_12626
For small, high-value items are time sensitive
emergency shipments that have to travel a long distance in shorter time 
It is mostly used by the members of the supply chain
who have shorter lead times or advanced service levels
and speedy delivery of goods 
Air carriers move products that have high value but are light in weight 
Limitations of air transport:
Air transport is relatively an expensive mode of transportation 
It is not suitable for transporting heavy
and bulky goods as well as for short distance travel 
for a sound transportation system 
Pipeline transport: Pipeline transport is a specific mode of transportation
for moving products which are in the form of gas, liquid or slurry 
The characteristics of pipeline transport:
Pipeline operates 24 x7 and 365 days
and move products such as crude petroleum, refined petroleum products and natural gas 
The initial investment in creating the pipeline
and the needed infrastructure is high 
Pipelines are fixed and are not flexible 
They can be used for certain commodities only
and cannot be used to move variety of products 
Let us discuss the merits and
The characteristics of transportation modes:
The various modes of transport can be compared
on the characteristics of their speed, frequency,
dependability, load they can carry and the service locations
which they can serve  The ranking of the various modes of
these factors are given below
In the table  Intermodal transportation:
Intermodal transportation is the use of
more than one mode of transport for the movement of shipment
from the point of origin to the point of destination 
limitations of each mode of transportation 
It uses two or more modes of transportation
to take the advantage of inherent economies use of each
and thus provide the integrated service at lower cost 
The most widely used intermodal systems
are the trailer on flat car TOFC
and the container on a flat car COFC 
Package carrier is a form intermodal transportation
provider who uses air, truck
and rail to transport the goods 
They also provide other value added service
Road transport: Roadways is the widely used
that allows shippers to get benefitted 
Transportation economies and pricing:
Transportation managers are responsible for determining
the effective and efficient transport mode
to satisfy the requirement of the supply chain members
to improve their efficiency 
Transportation economies and pricing
depend on certain factors which the transport manager should be aware of 
The transport economies and the pricing depends upon
your economic drivers, costing,
transport mode across the supply chain in any country 
carrier pricing, transportation rates and ratings 
The economic drivers are driven by the factors like distance
to be traveled, weight to be taken for the travel,
density of the products, stowability of the product,
handling of the product, liability and the market conditions for the product 
Transportation costing can be classified into
fixed cost, variable cost, joint cost and common cost 
Carrier pricing strategy depends on cost of service and the value of service 
Transportation rates depend on the region
and the commodity to be transported 
Trucks are used to transport materials 
The selection procedure for the transport mode
could vary from the simple decision
either by identifying one feasible method of distribution
or a choice of methods to distribute the products 
The transport manager identifies
the best mode from among the choice of alternates available
based on the economic and the pricing factors 
To conclude, we have to understand that with the advent of
e-services the lead time to delivery has reduced considerably 
The movement of the product and raw materials
This industry is divided into two parts 
cannot move through e-services and it has to restrict the movement to roads,
rail, air, waterways and pipeline 
Transportation has improved considerably with the mechanical development
and development of technology within a short span 
It plays a very important role in the supply chain
to distribute the goods from one place to another place
in an efficient and effective manner to satisfy the customer expectations 
In this edition we have discussed the different modes of transportation
and the transport economies in a supply chain 
In the next edition we will discuss the role of the warehousing, objectives,
The first one is the truckload
types of warehouses and the warehouse strategy in a supply chain 
Thank you 
and the second one is less than truck load 
Truckload is used to move bulk quantities of goods
In the last edition we have discussed the role of transportation
which display the economies of scale with respect to the distance traveled 
It is best suited for shipping
products between manufacturing facilities and the warehouses 
Less than truck load operations are priced
to encourage shipments in small lots,
usually less than a truck load  Less than truck load shipping
is suitable for shipments that are larger to be mailed as small puck packages 
The characteristics of road transport:
Road transport is a cheaper mode of transport for shorter distances
when compared to other modes of transportation 
and the principles of transportation in a supply chain 
It is a highly flexible mode of transportation
as the loading and unloading of goods is possible at any destination
and it also provides door to door service 
Road transportation helps to carry goods from one place to the another in hilly areas 
It is the best suited mode of transportation
to handle smaller shipments over short distances 
Compared to other modes of transportation, the investments is less 
Limitations of road transport:
The carrying capacity of road transport is limited
and hence it is not economical for long distance transportation of goods 
In this edition we will discuss the different modes of transportation
Similarly, transportation of heavy goods or bulkier goods
by road involves high cost 
The cost of maintenance of the trucks is increasing day by day,
resulting in increased transportation cost 
Let us now look into rail transport 
Railways plays a significant role in the moving goods
across the supply chain in the country 
Our country has the largest railway network
making it an important mode of transportation 
Freight trains are used in railways to move goods across the supply chain 
and impact of transport economies in a supply chain 
The freight trains are usually powered by
diesel, electricity and steam engines
depending upon the rail network they operate 
The characteristics of railways are:
Railway is the best suited transportation mode
for shipment of products like fertilizers, cement, food grains and coal
in large quantities from the production plant to the warehouses 
It has the lowest variable cost 
Railways can work in tandem with other modes of transportation
to improve the efficiency of the supply chain 
The different modes of transportation are given in the diagram 
Railway is suitable for carrying heavy goods in large quantities
over long distances at the lowest cost of transportation 
It is relatively faster mode of transport
compared to road transport for a particular location 
The limitations of rail transportation:
Railway transportation is expensive for carrying goods over short distances 
Railway network is not available in all parts of the country
and hence goods cannot be moved through railway to those locations 
It has to depend on other modes for reaching the destination 
Railways provide service according to fixed time table,
Air, water, surface and multimodal transportation 
which they plan and hence, it is not flexible for loading
or unloading of goods at any place according to the customer's requirement 
Water transport: Water transportation
is the oldest mode of transportation
between countries as well as within countries where inland waterways are available 
The characteristics of water transport are:
Water transport is the cheapest mode of transportation
to move large bulk commodity such as mining, chemicals, cement,
and certain agricultural products  It uses large ship
and commercial vessels that can carry billions of tons of cargo 
There are five basic transportation modes
Water transport is suitable for moving large quantities of goods
that are non-perishable in nature 
It is an effective mode of transportation in international trade 
The limitations of water transport:
Water transport depends on the depth and navigability of rivers
and canals  As this varies different transport vessels are needed
to operate in different places  Hence, this requires large investments
and their maintenance cost is also high 
Water transport is a slow moving mode of transport and therefore,
it may not be suitable for transporting perishable goods 
air, water and surface  Surface has roadways, railways,
The water transport is adversely affected by weather conditions
which may affect the duration of movement and the delivery of the goods 
Air transport: Air Transport is the newest but least used mode of transportation
owing to its high cost of moving goods 
Though it is high cost, the speed in which they move
has other benefits for the supply chain on warehousing and inventory 
At transport despite being high profile,
it still remains a potential transport mode for the supply chain 
The characteristics of air transport:
Air transportation is the best suited mode of transportation 
and pipeline  All transportation modes are vital
Supply_chain_Management_12808
they are sorted and packed according to the requirement of the customers 
Packed goods are then loaded into the transport
for shipment to the customers 
Warehouse is responsible for replenishment of stocks to meet the demand of the customer 
They have to handle the return of goods,
which is very important for a supply chain 
Types of warehouses  Private warehouse:
Private warehouse are owned and operated by a manufacturer
or a trader for shipping and storing its own products 
It is suitable for firms that require special handling and storage features
till their actual use or sale and making them
and they want to control the design and operation of the warehouse 
Second, Public warehouses: Public warehouses are
owned and operated by Central Warehousing Corporation
and the State Warehousing Corporation 
It is licensed by the government  They Provide storage
and physical distribution on rental basis for small and large firms 
Public warehouses provide flexibility and cost competitiveness in the market 
They can be classified as general merchandise, refrigerated,
special commodity and bonded warehouse 
Refrigerated warehouses are designed to store products
available conveniently whenever it is needed 
which require frozen or chilled environment for storing the products 
Special commodity warehouses are designed to stock
specific products  Bonded warehouses are licensed by the government
to store products prior to the payment of import taxes and duties 
These warehouses are located at the place of ports
to support the importers and exporters 
Co-operative warehouses: Co-operative warehouses are owned,
managed and controlled by co-operatives socities 
It facilitates the service at most economical rates to its members 
Contract warehouses:
A warehouse is a place to store inventory and it creates time utility
Contract warehouses have the combination
of the characteristics of private and public operations 
A contractual warehouse will offer a range of value added services
to their customers at the lowest possible cost 
They will provide total logistics solution to their customers 
Warehouse Strategy: A warehouse strategy
depends on the company's objectives and the logistics objectives,
which may be to make goods available to the customers,
to improve the customer service offered,
to minimize the total distribution cost 
by bridging the gap between production and consumptions of goods 
A warehouse strategy will focus on determining
the number of warehouses needed
and the type of warehouses needed for meeting the company's requirement 
Many firms use a combination of private, public
and contract warehouse facilities for their requirements 
A private or contract facility may be used to cater to the requirements
of them throughout the year  Whereas the public facilities are used
by them to cater to the peak season requirements 
There are other qualitative factors
which have to be considered the formation of the warehouse strategies 
Role of warehouse in a supply chain 
They are one, Presence Synergies 
A warehouse should be located near the market,
which will be able to support the inventory requirement
to meet the customer expectations 
Two, Industry Synergies: The warehouse should be able to
colette with the other firms in meeting the industry requirement
to get the benefit of multi products and the economies of scale 
Third, Operating Flexibility:
A warehouse should be able to adjust their internal policies and procedures
to meet the product variety and the customer needs
Warehouse store inventory across the supply chain
as in when they require  Fourth, Location Flexibility:
A warehouse should be able to adjust the warehouse location
and the number of warehouses in accordance with the seasonal or permanent demand
changes of the market  Five, Scale Economies:
A warehouse should be able to reduce the material handling
and storage cost through the application of advanced technologies 
These factors have to be considered
in determining the warehouse strategies 
Next, let us look at the warehouse location strategy 
The warehouse location strategy depends on various factors like
to coordinate and serve the product supply and the consumer demand 
quantity to be stored, nature and variety of the products stocked,
consolidation of the products needed to satisfy the market,
lead time, transportation costs, cost of land, tax structure of the region,
incentives provided by the government if any,
labour availability, cost of construction
and the cost of other utilities and the availability of other utilities 
The site selection for the warehouse will have to be done
after analyzing the factors of location and decided 
Warehouse layout: Warehouse layout
is the process of allocating space
This helps the members of the supply chain to have a continuous production
for the equipments and facilities needed for warehousing operation 
It depends on the choice of material handling equipments to be used
and the design of floor plan to facilitate product flow 
If the warehouses uses pallets,
then the first step is to determine the pallet size 
Allocation of space for the various functions of the warehouse
should be planned during the layout stage 
The layout should be planned to protect against theft and pilferage 
A good layout plan for a warehouse will improve its efficiency 
Automation in warehouse:
and improve their labour productivity 
Technology has enabled the warehouse operations
to start up and run smoothly to accommodate the rapid changes
successfully to meet the requirements of the business 
Pick to light technology, voice activated receiving and packing
has automated the warehouse process 
Transport management systems using RFID tags
helps in improving the warehousing process 
Today, we have a fully automated warehouse
using a warehouse management system and robots to help, Handle products 
This improves the efficiency of the warehouse
The need for inventory at different points of the supply chain
In the last edition, we have discussed the different modes of transportation
and the supply chain process 
In this edition, we have discussed the role of the warehousing,
objectives, types of warehouses and the warehouse strategy in a supply chain 
is achieved through the warehouse activities 
And also it acts as a storage point for them 
A warehouse has become part of the just in time production strategy 
A centralized warehouse which manages parts inventory
to cater to the requirement of the production units
reduces the inventory to be stocked at the production centers 
A warehouse which stores variety of products
helps to consolidate the multi product requirement
of the retail outlets of the supply chain 
Similarly, consolidation of products, quantity
and the transport economies in a supply chain 
helped to get the benefit of transport economies
and thereby reducing the logistics cost 
Technology has influenced every aspect of warehouse operation
by creating better ways to perform the functions of
storage and handling of goods in a warehouse 
Objectives of warehouse:
The objectives of warehouse are to maximize the use of information,
space, equipment and labor,
to ensure the easy accessibility
and protection of assets and all items stored,
In this edition we will discuss the role of warehousing, objectives,
to focus on minimizing material handling cost
and to minimize the warehouse operating cost 
Warehouse benefits:
Warehouse benefits can be classified as economic benefits and service benefits 
Consolidation and break bulk: In consolidation
the warehouse receives material from number of sources,
which are stocked and consolidated into a single shipment
to customers in a single location 
This helps to reduce the transportation cost of moving goods to the customers 
In break bulk, the warehouse receives a large shipment
types of warehouses and the warehouse strategy in a supply chain 
from a single source, which is stocked
and then sorted out the requirements of different customers
and the delivery of goods happens to them 
And economy of scale is achieved in moving goods to the warehouse
by these two methods  Sorting:
Sorting is the process of re configuring the goods
as it flows from the origin to the destination 
It is done through cross docking, mixing and assembly of products 
Cross docking is the process of combining inventory from multiple origins
into a required assortment for a specific customer and transporting the goods 
Warehousing:
Mixing is the process of sorting inventory received from multiple origins
into a required combination of goods for a specific customer
and transporting goods at the lowest cost 
Assembly is the process of assembly of products
and components that are moved to the warehouse
from a second tier supplier for the manufacturing plant 
Third, seasonal storage: Products manufactured
throughout the year, which have seasonal demand are stored in the warehouse
and sold during the seasons  Similarly, products which are produced
during seasons are stored in the warehouses,
Warehousing refers to the activities involved in storage of goods
which are sold throughout the year  This is known as Seasonal Storage 
Reverse Logistics: The warehouse facilitates
the return of goods to the manufacturer
and helps the members of the supply chain to get their economic benefits 
Let us discuss the various service benefits 
First one, Spot Stock:
Manufacturers plan and stock seasonal goods in the warehouse
to improve their responsiveness to the market 
They forecast the demand for the product and select the warehouse
where the stocks are maintained to satisfy their demand immediately 
on a large scale in a systematic and orderly manner 
This process is known as Spot Stock 
Second, Assortment: Manufacturers stock different products
manufactured by them in the warehouse 
This enables the warehouse to cater to the
multi product requirements of the members of the supply chain 
Third, Value Added Services:
A modern distribution warehouse specializes in performing a range
of value added services to change the physical features
or the configuration of the products to be shipped
to suit the requirement of the customer as given by retailers 
It involves in holding or preserving goods in huge quantities
Let us discuss now the warehouse operations 
The warehouse activity starts from unloading of goods
received from the manufacturer 
The goods received are to be checked for quantity and quality 
Once the goods are checked they are moved
to the place or storing in the designated place in the warehouse 
When the order is received from the customer,
the warehouse initiates the process of order picking 
Order picking is the process of taking the stored product to the place of packing 
When the required goods are picked from this warehouse,
from the time of their purchase or production
from the source and communicate them effectively to the members of the supply chain 
Accurate information helps the members of the supply chain
to plan and meet the supply chain requirements efficiently 
In this edition, we have discussed
the concept of integrated logistics system
and its components in a supply chain 
In the next edition, we will discuss the different activities
of the integrated logistics system in a supply chain 
Thank you 
as well as satisfy the service level requirements
of each and every member in the supply chain
to meet the expectations of the customer 
The learning objectives of this module are
to have an understanding of the concept of integrated logistics system,
to understand the activities of integrated logistics system,
to discuss the barriers of integrated logistics system,
to discuss the factors affecting integration of supply chain 
The learning outcomes of this module are
an understanding of the importance of
Welcome to all  In this module, we are going to discuss
integrated logistics system in a supply chain,
an understanding of the activities of the integrated logistics system
and its components, an understanding of the obstacles
to integration of the supply chain,
an analysis of the factors for improving the integration of the supply chain 
Introduction:
Supply Chain integration is the process of coordinating various activities
across the supply chain which includes procurement,
manufacturing, distribution, inventory management,
transportation, warehousing and customer satisfaction
The Integrated Logistics Management in a Supply Chain 
from the raw material stage to the finish goods stage
and to the end customers  Integrated Logistics Management System:
Integrated logistics management system is an interface between
the procurement, manufacturing and the distribution function
of the logistics function
to achieve the basic objectives of logistics
to provide better customer service at the lowest possible cost 
Integrated logistics management
is the process of anticipating customer needs and wants 
Acquiring the capital materials, people, technologies
Let us have an introduction to supply chain 
and information necessary to meet these requirements
and the wants of the customer  The objectives of integrated logistics function:
The objectives are to provide better customer service
at the lowest cost, to ensure higher productivity
among the members of the supply chain, to avoid duplication of logistics
activity by better coordination among the members of the supply chain,
to monitor and improve the existing logistics system continuously
for improving the efficiency of the logistics system 
In integrated logistics management,
coordination is brought into various activities
Supply chain management is the set of activities
relating to procurement of materials, inventory flow
and physical distribution of materials across the supply chain
from the supplier point to the customer point
through manufacturing to the market
to satisfy the expectation of the customer 
Hence, integrated logistics management system
is referred to the set of activities relating to storage and flow of materials,
information and control system in a cost effective manner 
If you look at the diagram, the relationship of
the logistics management system is evident 
involved in the process of efficiently integrating the suppliers,
In an integrated logistics system,the flow of information happens in both directions 
The backward information flow provides
information about the customers, their requirements,
heightened customer orders, quality specification,quality feedback,
procurement quality, production and dispatch planning
to facilitate the coordination across the supply chain 
This information helps in defining and manufacturing quantity,
merchandising and purchase requirements down the supply chain 
The forward information flow provides information
such as availability of products, order processing,
manufacturers, warehouses and stores 
distribution schedule, time of delivery, quality assurance reports
and warranty details across the supply chain 
Inventory flow happens in the forward direction across the supply chain 
During this process of flow value addition takes place
to meet the requirements of the customer at the required time 
Hence, the integrated logistics process focuses on
two interrelated activities, information flow
and inventory flow across the supply chain 
All the members of the supply chain are expected to work together
to achieve the objective of meeting the expectation of the customer
Supply chain distributes the products manufactured to the right destination
at the required time at the lowest cost 
Let us now discuss about the impact of inventory flow in integrated logistics system 
The logistics operation starts from the shipment of raw materials
and parts from the supplier
to the manufacturer for processing to produce products
needed by the customers, which are to be delivered
at the required time  As the inventory flows,
the material gains value
at every step of the transformation process
till it becomes the finished goods inventory 
in the required quantities at the right time
The inventory flow comprises procurement, manufacturing support
and physical distribution 
Let us now look into the impact of information flow in integrated logistics system 
Information flow happens across the supply chain
in both directions to enhance the performance of the supply chain 
This integrates the process of procurement, manufacturing
and physical distribution of the materials
to satisfy the requirements of products to different locations
or the required time along the supply chain 
The key aspect of information flow is to get the right information
in order to minimize the total costs of supply chain
It acts as an interface between planning and coordination
as well as the operations in detailing the place,
timing and composition of the inventory to be positioned 
This helps in balancing the timing and consolidation
to create efficient inventory flow through the value chain 
Manufacturing requirements: Information flow helps to determine
the need for goods and services across the supply chain
to meet their requirement This initiates the manufacturing requirements
in the supply chain and the inventory deployment across the supply chain 
The manufacturing requirement drives to prepare
The logistics operation starts from the shipment of raw materials
the master production scheduling
and the material requirement planning to meet the demand 
The next element is Procurement 
Procurement requirements are based on the manufacturing requirement,
the inbound logistics of raw materials and components are planned
and this helps in maintaining the product supplies continuously 
Forecasting:
Information flow helps the supply chain
to predict the demand of the supply chain
to enable it to plan effectively and meet the requirements 
and parts from the supplier to the manufacturer for processing
These are the elements which have the impact
on the planning and coordination flow 
Let us now discuss the various elements in operational flow 
The operational information flow helps to provide
the data required for integrating the physical distribution,
manufacturing support and procurement operations
for meeting the requirement of the supply chain 
The process of operational flow includes various elements starting from
order management, order processing, distribution operations,
inventory management, transportation and procurement 
to produce products needed by the customer,
Let us discuss these elements in detail 
Order management:
Information flow helps to provide the information of the customers requirement,
which is translated across the supply chain
to plan and execute the same information 
Information Technology has revolutionized
the process of order management process,
which helps in efficient process of logistics system 
Order processing: The process of order processing
involves in allocating the inventory
which are delivered at the required time 
and or the planned manufacturing to meet the customer requirement 
Information Technology has facilitated
faster and two way communication process across the supply chain
to share the needs of the customers and plan the logistics process
in satisfying the customer requirement  Distribution Operations 
Information flow helps to facilitate
and coordinate the logistics process
by providing the product assortments to the distribution channel
to meet the customer requirements 
This helps in improving the efficiency of the logistics system 
As the inventory flows,the material gains value
Inventory management: Operational information flow
helps in deployment of the inventory
across the supply chain to satisfy the planned requirements
of the logistics process  Transportation:
Operational information flow helps to
plan the movement of goods, documentation for the movement of goods
and the process of consolidation of goods
for efficient utilization of the transport capacity 
Whereby it decreases the logistics cost  Procurement:
Operational information flow helps to share information
at every step of the transformation process
necessary to complete the purchase order preparation
and release of the same to ensure the continuous supply of
inbound logistics, to facilitate operations
that link customers and its suppliers 
To summarize, planning and coordination flows
helps to provide information relating to planned activities 
Whereas the operational flows helps to provide
the information to direct the day to day activities of the supply chain 
In this edition, we have discussed
the different activities of the integrated logistics system in a supply chain 
till it becomes the finished goods inventory 
In the next edition, we will discuss
the barriers of integrated logistics system
and the factors for integrating the supply chain effectively 
Thank you 
The inventory flow comprises procurement, manufacturing support
and physical distribution as shown in the diagram below 
Let us discuss the each factor
In the last edition we have discussed the concept of
which affects the inventory flow 
Procurement: Procurement is the process of purchasing
and arranging inbound movement of goods that is materials,
parts, semi finished goods, finished goods
from the suppliers to the manufacturer,
to warehouses and to the retail stores 
It ensures the availability of materials,
products at the required place at the right time 
Manufacturing support  The second component
Where you require Manufacturing support
integrated logistics system
which is concerned with the process of planning
and scheduling the production of products 
They prepare the master production schedules,
the material requirement plan and arrange for
the timely availability of materials
and work in process for the manufacturing process 
The important decision in manufacturing support
is to determine what to manufacture?
When to manufacture? and where to manufacture?
They manage the work-in process as it flows between the
and its components in a supply chain 
stages of manufacturing 
The third component in from an inventory flow is the physical distribution process 
Physical distribution is concerned with the movement of goods
across the supply chain  It starts from the manufacturing point
to the customers through the intermediaries 
Physical distribution is an integral part of the marketing effort
to meet the requirements of products needed by the customers
at the right place and at the right time  Let us discuss the components of
information flow in an integrated logistics system 
Information flow happens across the supply chain in both directions
In this edition, we will discuss the different activities
to enhance the performance of the supply chain 
This integrates the process of procurement, manufacturing
and physical distribution of the materials
to satisfy the requirements of products to different locations
at the required time along the supply chain 
The key aspect of information flow is to get the right
information from the source and to communicate them effectively
to the members the supply chain  Accurate information
helps the members of the supply chain to plan
and meet the supply chain requirements efficiently 
of the integrated logistics system in a supply chain 
Information flow has two main components
namely, planning and coordination flows
and operational flows  As shown in the diagram below 
Let us discuss each component independently 
Let us look at planning and coordination flow 
Various elements of the supply chain
helps in coordination of the members across the supply chain 
The elements are the strategic objective of the supply chain,
capacity constraint of the members of the supply chain,
the logistics requirement of the supply chain to move the products,
Integrated logistics process focuses on two interrelated activities,
inventory requirement across the supply chain,
manufacturing requirements to satisfy the demand,
procurement of materials for production
and the forecasting of demand 
Let us discuss the elements
one by one  Strategic objectives:
Strategic objectives are the driving force of the supply chain
which is based on the financial and marketing goals of the value chain 
Based on the objectives, the supply chain
determines the nature and the location of customers to serve
information flow and inventory flow across the supply chain 
and determine their requirements of products and services to satisfy them 
Once they determine this, the supply chain
can estimate the requirement of resources to support inventory,
receivables,facilities,equipment and capacity needed
to satisfy the requirement of the customers
of the supply chain  Capacity Constraint:
Information flow shares the details about the demand
to be met by the supply chain 
Based on this, the supply chain identifies the limitations
and the bottlenecks in manufacturing capabilities
Let us discuss the details of the inventory flow and its
to decide on the need for outsourcing the requirements to meet the customer demand 
The next component is the logistics requirements 
Information flow help the supply chain to get the forecast of demand
and information regarding customer orders,
and the inventory status of the members of the supply chain 
This helps the logistics department to plan distribution facilities
and other resources required for implementing the capacity plan 
Inventory deployment: Information flow helps to determine
what, where and when the deployment of inventory
should be done in the logistics process 
impact on the integrated logistics system 
integration is shared information technology 
Development of a common database
and sharing of information across the supply chain
will enhance the integration of the logistics function 
All the members will have adequate information
for making collaborative decision to improve the supply chain performance 
In this edition, we have discussed the barriers of
integrated logistics system and the factors for
integrating the supply chain  Summary: In this module,
we have discussed the integrated logistics system 
Organizations must recognize the barriers
Integration of supply chain is the process where a company and its trading partners
work together in a coordinated manner
to achieve the same business objectives
through integrated business process and information sharing 
Integrated logistics system
is an interface of procurement function,
Manufacturing function and physical distribution function
of the total logistics function 
In order to achieve the logistics objective of
satisfying the customer at the lowest possible cost 
to the integration of the logistic process
Inventory flow and information flow
are the two interrelated activities of the integrated logistics system 
Organizational structure, measurement systems,
inventory ownership and information technology
are the barriers of the integration process 
Effective communication, aligns management across the supply chain,
empowerment of employees and shared information technology
across the supply chain will result in improved coordination
across the supply chain members for an effective integrated logistics system 
Thank you 
and address them for its efficiency 
Integration barriers of the logistics function
can be related to the organizational structure
and the measurement systems of the organization 
Inventory ownership across the supply chain
and the extent of information technology among the members of the supply chain
are also the barriers to the integration process 
Let us first discuss the organizational structure 
In the last edition, we have discussed the different activities
Organizational structure is formed based on the functional activities
an organization has to perform 
Managers are vested with the authority and responsibility
based on this  Every department
focuses on achieving its own performance based on the objectives 
Cooperation among the functional departments
is required to achieve the integration of the organization 
The formal organizational structure
does not allow the integration and it hinders the process 
To achieve successful integration of the logistics process
of the integrated logistics system in a supply chain 
across the supply chain,the managers need to facilitate
cross functional coordination
beyond the functional organizational structure 
The extent to which this integration happens
decides the successful integration of logistics function 
The second barrier: Measurement systems 
Poor measurement systems practices will be a substantial barrier
to the successful supply chain integration 
If a manager cannot accurately cost a process,
identify the best supply chain partners, it becomes a challenge 
In this edition, we will discuss the barriers of integrated logistics system
Managers of the organization
facilitate the cross functional coordination
to achieve the integration of the logistics function 
In this process, the managers increase their functional cost
for the sake of lowering the cost of the line integration 
A measurement system is needed,
which does not increase the functional costs
during the process of cross functional coordination of the supply chain
to achieve the integration  The third barrier:
Inventory ownership  Inventory is maintained by the members
and the factors for integrating the supply chain effectively 
across the supply chain to gain comfort and to protect against
uncertainties in supply and demand 
This helps them to improve their efficiency 
Inventory poses a big barrier
to integrated logistics if they are incorrectly located
or when the inventory becomes obsolete 
The fourth barrier: Information Technology 
Every member of the supply chain uses information technology
to improve their performance 
The application of the information technology
Barriers to logistics integration 
is aligned to the organizational requirement 
When integration happens, the databases of the organization
should be accessible to all the members across the supply chain 
Inadequate information systems support is an important barrier
for collaboration among the members across the supply chain 
Due to different technologies and the limitations in sharing of data
integration becomes difficult across the logistics function 
To overcome these barriers,
and to have an effective supply chain integration, it is possible
that a company can focus on the following: Communication
Successful integration of logistics function
The most effective facilitators
focus on increasing the frequency
and the quality of inter-firm communication 
Communication across the supply chain members
will ensure that products and services
are moved to the customers efficiently and effectively 
Better communication contributes to
problem solving and building relationship 
It helps in faster decision making
across the supply chain resulting in access to up to date information 
across the supply chain is possible
This also helps to decide the requirement of inventory
across the supply chain appropriately in terms of location and quantity 
The second factor which influences effective supply chain integration is
alliance management  Strengthening the relationship
across the supply chain helps in building an
effective supply chain  When the number of players
across the supply chain is less
integrating the logistics function is easy 
Whereas when the number of players across the supply chain increases,
integrating the members by building relationship
when the internal process of the organizations
is difficult and is important for effective logistics function 
The third important element for effective integration is people empowerment 
Cross-functional learning is important
for the integration of the supply chain activities 
Managers of the organizations have to be empowered
to make decisions on issues related to the coordinating activities
across the supply chain  This will help them
to achieve higher levels of
inter-firm coordination and integrated logistics function 
The fourth important element for effective supply chain
in the supply chain align with the overall function of the logistics activity 
The two major activities in procurement management are
strategic sourcing and purchasing process 
Supply chain management is an infrastructure
for effectively carrying out the procurement management function 
What is the strategic importance of
procurement management and supply chains?
Whether it is manufacturing or service,
proactive purchasing plays a major role in ensuring competitiveness 
Supply chain managers are involved in
broader policy making aspects of procurement function,
that connects the suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and customers 
Music
participate in the new product development
and are responsible for selecting sources, managing cost
and maintaining strategic alliance with suppliers 
Music
Procurement is a value addition to the customer 
The value addition by procurement functions are quality,
Music
reduced cost,
Music
So, when we talk about supply chain and procurement,
continuity of supply,
Music
building innovation,
Music
maximizing profits and customer value 
Music
Once a service or an item has been identified
as critical to the firm's operations, a supply process must be developed
with due consideration of the customer requirements,
supply base and technology road map 
we can identify the activities of what materials are sourced?
With this brief introduction on procurement functions
and its strategic role in supply chain management
I request you all to ponder on the following:
Identify and list the components
that are required to manufacture or shirt, a car or a computer 
Thank you and see you all in the lesson on strategic sourcing 
Make or buy decisions  How materials are sourced?
Music
Supplier selection and strategy 
Music
How is the material bought? Order processing 
Music
How materials arrive at a place of manufacturing?
Hi! learners, in this lesson we will be discussing
inbound logistics 
Music
How companies receive, store and issue the materials?
Material handling and control 
Music
How is the material procured converted into finished goods?
Manufacturing 
Music
How are the finished goods transported and distributed to the consumers?
Outbound logistics 
procurement management and its impact on supply chain 
Music
When we look into it, we understand that the procurement decisions
have an impact across the supply chain from the product development
to the product distribution 
So, learners having understood the impact of
procurement function across the supply chain activities,
we will move on to understand those important areas
in procurement, management and supply chain 
The three important areas are
strategic role of procurement management,
There I can see all thing, why is procurement management
strategic sourcing and purchase process 
The learning objectives of this module
is to provide insights to enhance knowledge in the areas
of operational issues in sourcing, procurement
and purchasing, decisions and processes for effective sourcing,
procurement and purchasing,
strategic role of procurement management for effective supply chain 
By the end of the session, you will be able to identify
and solve issues related to procurement management for effective supply chain,
design effective procurement processes
considered as a supply chain function?
for sustainable procurement across the supply chain 
Now, we will move on to the first lesson
in procurement management in supply chain management 
Strategic importance of procurement management on supply chain 
What is procurement management?
Let us consider this with an example that you can imagine
and then relate it to the organizational perspective 
Imagine that you want to host a surprise birthday party
for your friend and invite 20 friends
and serve them with refreshments 
Should a supply chain manager
How will you get the refreshments? What do you do?
Music
I will plan to buy a cake, some chips and coffee or soft drinks 
Music
Plan the products and material requirement 
I decide to make the cake and coffee and buy chips and soft drinks 
Make or buy decisions 
Music
I will buy the ingredients for making the cake
from a supermarket, chips and soft drinks from the Kirana shop near my house 
consider procurement issues for effective supply chain?
Music
Supplier identification and selection 
Music
I will place the order for chips and soft drinks,
take delivery of the products the previous day on payment of cash 
Music
Purchase and take delivery of materials 
I will prepare the cake the previous day and store it in the refrigerator 
The soft drinks and the chips will be delivered the next day 
The coffee will be purchased from the routine purchases made 
The answer is just one and that is,
Taking delivery and issuing it on time to meet the demand 
Music
So, learners if this is for a single event, you can imagine
what would be the procurement issues for an organization
who need to buy thousands and millions of components to manufacture
multiple products and provide services?
The solution is a systematic procurement management system
supported by supply chain infrastructure 
What is procurement management?
Procurement management includes decisions
supply chain management deals with
and processes for getting and ensuring availability of all the materials
needed to satisfy the customer need 
The process includes: Identification and specification of materials,
material requirement planning, make or buy decision,
identification and validation of sources,
supplier selection and relationship management,
contact of purchase activities,
material handling and inbound transportation,
tracking and managing supplier quality
and managing scrap
flow of materials and resources across all the activities

Dear learners, now let us conclude 
or in some cases stop catalyses 
In this module, we have studied in detail three common types of enzyme inhibitions namely
competitive, non-competitive, and substrate inhibition 
that place a role in digestion of starch 
And glycogen is considered a strategy for the treatment of disorders in carbohydrate
uptake 
Such as diabetes and obesity as well as dental caries and periodontal diseases 
Plants are an important source of chemical consequents with potential for inhibition
of alpha-amylase and can be used as therapeutic or functional food sources 
In this week we shall got acquainted with enzymes, proteases inhibitors and amylase
Amongst the phytoconstituents that has been investigated flavonoids are one of them 
That demonstrated the highest inhibitory activities with the potential of inhibition related to
number of hydroxyl groups in the molecule of the compound 
In the module on protease inhibitors, we learned that protease Inhibitors are molecules that
block the activity of proteases 
Protease Inhibitors can either be in the form of proteins, peptides or small molecules 
The first plant protease inhibitor was isolated from soybeans and characterized in nineteen
forty-seven 
They are grouped in two inhibitor families and are represented by two predominant inhibitor
from soybeans 
inhibitors 
The connects* soybean trypsin inhibitor that is STI and the Bromelain Burk Trypsin and
Chymotrypsin inhibitor that is BBI 
That reduces the biological activity of trypsin by controlling the activation and catalytic
reactions of proteins 
Protease inhibitors have been examined extensively as therapeutic agents primarily to deal 
With various human cancers effective against cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, inflammatory
diseases, and neurological disorders 
Thus, we have learned enzymes protease inhibitors and amylase inhibitors 
In the next week, we shall study active biodynamic principles in spices 
We studied that enzymes are biological catalysts, they increase the rate of chemical reactions
Thank you and happy learning experience 
taking place within living cell without themselves suffering any overall change 
specific in character, acting on a particular substrate or substrates to produce a particular
product or products 
Their activity may be inhibited by compounds called enzyme inhibitors 
They are substances which alter the catalytic action of enzyme and consequently slow down
Hello! Learners welcome to the tenth of our online  course on functional foods and nutraceuticals  
The second module, in this  week, is amylase inhibitors  
These are substances that bind to  alpha-amylases making them inactive  
They can inhibit the endogenous Alpha  amylases and mammalian alpha-amylase  
to understand the health  benefits of amylase inhibitors  
We shall study the role of alpha-amylase  in disorders of carbohydrate uptake,  
disorders of carbohydrates uptake  May cause severe health problem such as diabetes,  
obesity and oral diseases all of which  threatened and increasing worldwide population  
Amylase inhibitors play important role in  prevention and treatment of diseases which shall  
be dealt in detail in this module  The third module  
in this week will be protease Inhibitors  Plants are good sources of protease inhibitors  
Hope you have enjoyed learning organosulfur  compounds, introduction to anti-nutritional  
which protect them against diseases,  insects, *, and herbivores  
Protease Inhibitors are now treated  as very important signalling molecules  
in many biological activities  Such as inflammation, apoptosis,  
blood clotting, and hormone processing  In recent years, protease inhibitors have  
been examined extensively as therapeutic agents,  primarily to deal with various human cancers,  
cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis,  inflammatory diseases, and neurological disorders  
let us learn more about protease  inhibitors in this module 
factors in foods and phytates in the last week  In this week we shall study enzymes, protease  
inhibitors and amylase inhibitors  Before studying these inhibitors  
We shall study in brief what are enzymes  and the role they play in our body? 
We shall be revising the roles of digestive  enzymes since protease and amylase enzymes  
are concerned with digestion of  proteins and starches respectively  
We shall also study what are these enzymes  inhibitors and their mechanism of action  
This module shall also deal with specificity  of enzymes, naming and classification,  
digestive enzymes, and then effects  of Inhibitors on enzyme activity  
Dear learners, now let us conclude saponins are the glycosides containing non-sugar portion 
Hemagglutinins can cause growth inhibition in animals and diarrhoea, nausea, glutenin,
and vomiting in case of human being 
When injected lectins agglutinate RBC hemolysis and that occurs in extreme cases 
An introduction to the active biodynamic principles and spices, we learn that spices not only
enhance the flavour, aroma, and colour of food and beverages 
But they can also protect people from acute and chronic diseases due to their high antioxidant
and anti-inflammatory activity 
The most commonly used spices for culinary purposes that show biological activities are-
black pepper, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, cumin, fenugreek,
fennel, garlic,
Aglycol that is saponin attached to sugar mighty by glycosidic linkage 
gingerol, rosmarinic acid, quercitin, curcumin, eugenol, thymoquinone, piperine, allicin,
capsaicin, apigenin, luteolin, kaempferol, cyanidin, crocetin, crocin, diosgenin, eugenol,
cinnamaldehyde etcetera 
We have also studied the role of these by active components with respect to antioxidant
potential, anti-inflammatory property, anti mutagenic 
And anti-carcinogenic potential, anti lithogenic property, digestive stimulant action, hypolipidemic
effect and anti-diabetic influents 
Hope you have enjoyed learning Saponins and Hemagglutinin and an introduction to bioactive
compounds in spices, condiments and plant extracts 
Clinical studies have suggested that saponins affect the immune system in ways 
From the next week, we shall start studying individual bioactive components in spices

To their structure, sources, effect of processing, physiological effects, and health benefits
and potential uses in foods 
In the forthcoming week, we shall be studying spices mainly 
We shall you studying bioactive components namely resveratrol, quercetin, kaempferol,
crocin, glutenin, cinnamaldehyde 
Thank you and happy learning experience 
That help to protect the human body against cancers and also lower cholesterol levels 
Saponins decrease blood lipids, lower cancer risks, and lower blood glucose response 
A high saponin diet can be used in the inhibition of dental caries and platelet aggregation 
In the treatment of hypercalciuria in humans and as an antidote against acute lead poisoning 
Hemagglutinins any of a group of naturally, occurring glycoproteins, that cause red blood
cells that is erythrocytes to agglutinate are club together 
These substances are found in plants in invertebrates and certain microorganisms 
Dear learners welcome to the eleventh week of our online course on functional foods and
legume plants 
Saponins which derived their name from their ability from stable soap like foams in aqueous
solutions, constitute a complex and chemically diverse group of compounds 
In chemical terms, saponin contains a carbohydrate moiety attached to a tri-terpenoid or steroids 
Saponins are attracting considerable interest as a result of their diverse properties both
deleterious and beneficial 
Hemagglutinins, it refers to a substance that causes red blood cells to agglutinate, this
process is called as hemagglutination 
Antibodies and Lactins are commonly known hemagglutinins 
As in legumes most cereals commonly consumed by humans contain glycoprotein called lectins 
nutraceuticals 
Many lectins can bind to intestinal epithelial cell 
Where they may impair nutrient absorption and cause damage that may allow infiltration
of bacteria into bloodstream 
We shall study about saponins and Hemagglutinins in more detail 
Plant materials are composed of vast array of bioactive principles 
Which are responsible for the therapeutic activities of medicinal plants 
Since the ancient times, spices and culinary herbs have been added to food to enhance flavor
and improve their organoleptic properties 
spices and herbs have also been widely used as preservatives and medicine

Neurodegenerative diseases, infectious diseases, diabetes, osteoporosis, anxiety, allergies,
inflammation, and pain 
Cinnamaldehyde occurs naturally in the bark of cinnamon trees 
And other species of the genus Cinnamomum, like camphor and caesium 
Many of the health benefits of cinnamon and its effect on metabolism is due to the presence
of cinnamaldehyde in it 
It helps to fight against tooth decay and bad breath, and so the hub of cinnamon is
group 
used for enhancing oral health 
Cinnamaldehyde has been reported to have the vasodilation property action in vitro 
Cinnamaldehyde exhibit antimicrobial activity, anti-diabetic, anticancer activity, and anti-inflammatory
activity 
Crocin is the chemical constituent, isolated from the saffron, and the dried trifled stigma
of the plant Crocus sativus, and also from the fruits of gardenia 
It is found to be effective as antiproliferative, antioxidant,
latent, and Alzheimer's disorder 
Saffron and crocin may improve the function of central nervous system and mental health
Widely distributed in plant kingdom and with several therapeutic effects 
status 
Through regulating the synthesis of chemical neurotransmitters in the brain including dopamine,
norepinephrine, and serotonin 
Luteolin is found in plant materials, often in the form of glycoside 
Which are usually metabolized by the intestinal bacteria, cleaved 
And gluconated during uptake in the gut, and metabolized in the organism 
When it comes to the pharmacological activities of luteolin 
It is often associated with its ability to induce apoptosis 
Which involves redox regulation, DNA damage, protein kinases 
Which inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells and suppression of metastasis and angiogenesis

Cinnamon, it contains essential oils and other  compounds such as cinnamyl, cinnamic acid,  
cinnamaldehyde, and cinnamate  Cinnamaldehyde is the major component  
comprising eighty-five percent in the essential  oil, and the purity of cinnamaldehyde in use  
is high, that is more than ninety-eight percent  Cinnamaldehyde is the aldehyde that gives  
cinnamon its flavor and odor  It occurs naturally in the bark  
of cinnamon tree and other species of the  genus Cinnamomum like camphor and cassia  
The color of saffron comes from the water-soluble  carotenoids, including crocetin and crocins  
Crocins are effective anti-depressant and  anti-anxiety agents as well as sexual motivator,  
memory enhancer, and sedative, which  are used for the treatment of different  
central nervous system disorders  Luteolin is present in celery, parsley,  
and hemagglutinins and an introduction to spices,  condiments, and plant extracts in the last week  
broccoli, onion leaves, carrots etcetera  Various epidemiological studies have led  
to the discovery of the anti-inflammatory  and anti-carcinogenic effects of Luteolin  
These properties are partly  due to its anti-oxidant and  
free radical scavenging capacities  In this week we shall learn about these  
bio-active components namely resveratrol,  quercetin, kaempferol, cinnamaldehyde,

Plants contain, containing resveratrol have  been used efficiently in traditional medicine  
for over two-thousand years  It can be found in some plants,  
fruits and derivatives, such as red wine  Resveratrol displace a wide range of  
valuable properties and this may  be due to its molecular structure  
Dear learners welcome to the thirteenth week of our online course on functional foods and
Capsaicin is an active component of chili peppers, which plants are belonging to the
genus capsicum 
It is an irritant for mammals including humans and produces a sensation of burning in any
tissue with which it comes in contact 
Capsaicin and several related molecules are known by the collective name capsaicinoids 
It has several health benefits which we shall be studying this week 
Piperine is responsible for the black pepper distinct biting quality 
Piperine has many pharmacological effects and several health benefits which will be
dealt in this week 
gingerols are the major constituents of fresh ginger and are found slightly reduced in dry
nutraceuticals 
ginger 
Whereas the concentration’s of sugar, which are the major gingerol dehydration products
are more abundant in dry ginger than in the fresh ginger 
The active components in cloves are eugenol and isoeugenol 
Eugenol has recently become a focus of interest because of its potential role in elevating
and preventing chronic diseases such as cancer, inflammatory reactions and other conditions 
The radical scavenging and active-inflammatory activities of eugenol have been shown to modulate
chronic diseases invitro and in vivo 
Thymoquinone is the prime component of the essential oil obtained from “Nigella Sativa Seeds”
commonly known as black cumin, black caraway, kalonji, and black onion seeds 
Hope you have enjoyed learning resveratrol, quercetin, kaempferol, crocin, cinnamaldehyde,
We shall be studying in more details about thymoquinone 
Apigenin, it belongs to the flavon subclass and is abundant in vegetables, fruits and
beverages, such as parsley, grapes, apples, chamomile tea and red wine 
Apigenin is also one of the active ingredients in Chinese medicinal herbs 
It serves multiple physiological functions such as strong anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant,
anti-bacterial 
And anti-viral activities, and blood pressure reduction 
Therefore apigenin has been used as a traditional medicine for centuries 
Throughout history, rosemary has been famous for its medicinal properties and its ability
to improve memory

Rosmarinic acid has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and anti-allergic activities 
In this module, we shall study the structure, chemical properties, extraction, bio-availability,
health benefits of rosmarinic acid 
In this week we shall study seven different bio-active components in spices 
And condiments, namely capsaicin, piperine, eugenol, gingerol, thymoquinone, apigenin
and rosmarinic acid 
We have studied about the physiological effects of these bioactive compounds under introduction
to active bio-active principles in spices and condiments 
Let me now give you a brief introduction of these major bioactive compounds 
Now let us conclude, in this week, we have studied fenugreek and diosgenin 
It also acts as a cardioprotective agent 
Conjugated linoleic acid also known as bovinic acid, as it is produced naturally in the digestive
tract of ruminants like cattle, goats, and sheep 
The main dietary source of conjugated linoleic acid is beef and meat, milk and eggs, and
meat of grass-fed animals 
Conjugated linoleic acid is also available as a supplement commercially, Conjugated linoleic
acid 
As a recognized for its potential anti-carcinogenic, anti-diabetic, anti-atherogenic, and immune-modulatory
functions in animal and human beings 
One of the most important bioactive nutrients that is alpha-linolenic acid or ALA commonly
We have also studied conjugated linoleic acid and omega-three fatty acids 
referred as omega-three fatty acids or n-three fatty acids 
Omega-three fatty acid is an essential fatty acid as it cannot be synthesized in the body
and must be supplemented in the diet 
On consumption, it is the precursor of long-chain fatty acids that is eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid that is DHA

The other omega-three fatty acids like EPA and DHA are both found in fatty fish and shellfish 
The functional properties of omega-three fatty acids showed a verity of therapeutic functions
like anti-inflammatory, anti-cholesterol, brain function boosting, antidepressant,
Fenugreek due to its appreciated bioactive components, it has many therapeutic applications 
anti-
carcinogenic properties  It is also known to bring in significant production in blood lipids, hypotension and increase
body immunity 
One must also be causes to use omega-three dietary supplements in excess as it may interfere
with certain drugs like anticoagulanting medications 
Hope you like online on omega-three fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid 
In the next week which will also be our last week of online course on functional foods
and nutraceuticals 
We shall study non-nutrient effects of proteins, peptides and nucleotides, vitamins, and minerals 
Thank you and happy learning experience 
Such as antioxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-carcinogenic, hypoglycemic, hypercholesterolemic are the
major medicinal properties of fenugreek as established in various
studies  The evidence thus far reported in the literature on diosgenin supports the idea 
That this fenugreek component exerts beneficial effects on several physiological markers relevant
to metabolic syndromes 
hyperlipidemia 
Dear learners welcome to the fourteenth week of our online course on functional foods and
subjects 
Fenugreek has been used as a spice throughout the world to enhance the sensory quality of
foods 
Among the different bioactive compounds found in fenugreek, the major chemical constituents
We shall be learning in more detail about these bio-active compounds 
From this week we shall start learning about the non-nutrient effects of nutrients namely-
proteins, peptides 
And nucleotides, conjugated-linoleic-acid, and omega-three-fatty-acids, minerals, and
vitamins 
nutraceuticals 
Let me first explain to you what are these non nutrient effects of nutrients?
We know that nutrients are substances that can carry out one or more functions of foods
and deficiency of which generally results into deficiency diseases 
Carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals are the nutrients 
However, some nutrients besides their role as nutrients can also show pharmacological
benefits which when consumed 
These are known as non-nutrient effects 
In this week we shall introduce you to conjugated linoleic acids and omega-three-fatty-acids,
their chemistry, natural food sources, metabolism and bioavailability 
Their therapeutic benefits and perspectives of food application 
Hope you have enjoyed learning different bio-active compounds in spices 
And condiments namely capsaicin, piperine, eugenol, gingerol, thymoquinone, apigenin
and rosmarinic acid last week 
In this series of bio-active components, we shall study the last compound diosgenin which
is present in fenugreek 
We shall also cover the health benefits of other bio-active compounds present in fenugreek 
To cover maximum bio-active compounds of spices, we have presented their brief accounts in
videos but you can refer e-text to get deeper knowledge and better understanding of these
Dear learners welcome to the fifteenth week of our online course on functional foods and
in human health besides their known functions 
And in weight-reducing diets and the role of peptides and nucleotides as nutraceuticals
or functional foods 
The second module of this week will be on non-nutrient effects of nutrients with respect
to vitamins 
The role of vitamins in the human body is like the simple spark plug to the automobile
without which the automobile will remains stationary 
All living cells and organisms likewise require many organic compounds to sustain metabolic
reactions 
nutraceuticals 
processes 
This module aims to enlighten the learners on specific health benefits of vitamins, In
addition to their physiological roles 
Now the last module will be on the minerals 
Minerals are chemical constituents used by the body, for the maintenance of certain physico
chemical processes which are essential for life although they yield no energy 
They have important roles to play in many activities in the body 
These must be supplied in the diet and vary from grams to micrograms per day, for the
macro and microelements respectively 
Hope you have enjoyed learning fenugreek, and diosgenin, and Conjugated Linoleic Acid,
The physiological role and health benefits of minerals will include calcium, phosphorous,
magnesium, sodium, potassium 
And chloride that is * micro and iron, zinc, selenium, chromium,
manganese, iodine, and fluorine, these are micro minerals 
and Omega Three Fatty Acids 
In this week we shall study non nutrient effects of specific nutrients with respect to proteins,
peptides, and nucleotides, vitamins, and minerals 
This last week module will be taught by my mentor and teacher doctor Sabiha Vali, former
professor and head, department of home science, Rastrasanth Tukroji Maharaj Nagpur University,
Nagpur 
Dear learners in this week you will be introduced to the role of proteins, peptides and nucleotides
Dear learners, in the first week we have studied the history, definition, and classification
Although, commonly clearly existed between definitions offered by different health-oriented
professional organizations 
But finally, in “two-thousand-seventeen” functional food centre USA defined functional
foods by providing clarity and more comprehensive understanding of its meaning 
Module-three described the classification of functional foods and nutraceuticals according
to Source or origin, nutrient and non-nutrient, organ or organ system, modifications in foods
specific functional components, mechanism of action, and chemical nature of food 
And in the third module, we have studied the preserved effect of functional foods and nutraceuticals 
This module has given us the brief account of how inclusion and consumption of (bio)
biological active ingredients in foods and vegetables has been linked to help battle non-communicable
of functional foods and nutraceuticals 
diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and gastrointestinal tract disorders 
Please do attempt self-assessment and practice assignment at the end of every module 
This will help you to prepare yourself for final examination 
Please do not forget to fill feedback form 
In the next week, we shall study basic concepts of probiotics, pre-biotics, sin-biotics, and
post biotics 
We shall begin with taxonomy and important characteristics of probiotic microorganisms
and health effects and mechanism of action of probiotics 
Thank you and happy learning 
History showed us that the term “Functional Food” was born in Japan, and the Japanese
were the first to observe that the food could have a role beyond nutrient supply 
Japan was the first country to legislate these products as foods of specified health use 
Europe and the American countries incorporated later the concept of added value of food 
Second module taught us definitions of functional foods and nutraceuticals given by several
health-oriented professional organization 
There were no universally accepted definitions for functional foods and nutraceuticals till
two-thousand-seventeen 
Hello learners, Welcome to online course on functional foods and nutraceuticals

It will also have lecture notes in the form of E-text or further reading and additional
Dear learners, now in the second week we have studied introduction to probiotics, pre-biotics
They may be consumed in the form of raw vegetables and fruits, fermented pickles or dairy products 
Further, in the fifth module, we have studied about the taxonomy and important features
of probiotic microorganisms namely lactobacillus and bifidobacterium, lactic acid bacteria
are gram-positive and non-sporing, catalyst negative organisms that are divide of cytochromes
and of non-aerobic habit but are aero-tolerant, fastidious, acid-tolerant, and strictly fermentative 
Lactic acid is the major end product of sugar fermentation 
Bifidobacterium are gram-positive polymorphic branched rods that occurs singly in chains
or clumps, and they are non-spore-forming,
non-motile, and non-filamentous  They  are anaerobic and chemoorganotrophs having
a fermentative type of metabolism 
and sin-biotics, taxonomy and important features of probiotic microorganisms, and health effects,
We also learned about the health effects and mechanism of action of these probiotic microorganisms 
The module taught us in detail “how pro-biotics work” through enhancement of the epithelial
barrier, increased adherence to intestinal mucosa, inhibition of pathogen adhesion, competitive
exclusion of pathogenic microorganisms, production of antimicrobial substances and modulation
of immune system 
Under health benefits, we have studied anti-inflammatory activity, anti-cancer activity, anti-allergic
activity, angiogenic activity, and anti-obesity effects of probiotics 
As well as effects of probiotics on brain and central nervous system 
In the forthcoming module, we shall study about pro-biotics in various foods and the
quality assurance of pro-biotics and safety 
and mechanism of action of probiotics 
Please do attempt self-assessment and practice assignment at the end of every module 
This will help you to prepare yourself for final exam 
Please do not forget to fill feedback form 
So, wishing you a happy learning 
Thank you 
The fourth module may does familiar with the basic concepts of difference between pro-biotic,
pre-biotic, sin-biotic, and pros-biotics, we have gained knowledge about the pro-biotic
microorganisms namely lactobacillus and bifidobacterium, and how are they beneficial to our health 
The importance of pre-biotics 
And their mechanism of action have also been dealt upon 
The introduction of probiotics, pre-biotics or sin-biotics into human diet is favourable
for the intestinal microbiota 
Dear learners, in the third week, we have studied pro-biotics in various foods and quality
and fruit juices and soy-products 
We have also studied classification of pro-biotic foods namely traditional dairy-based pro-biotic
foods, such as curds, yogurt, cheese, buttermilk 
Dairy-based non-fermented foods like pro-biotic ice creams 
Non-dairy-based foods like fruits and vegetable juices, purees, pulps, chunks, soya milk,
beverages, fermented cereal-based beverages, probiotic liquids 
We have also studied some commonly consumed traditional dairy-based
non-dairy
for lactic acid bacteria to be used as pro-biotics which includes the ability to exert a beneficial
assurance of pro-biotics and safety 
effect on the host withstand into a boost up at a high cell counts, and remain viable
throughout the shelf life of the product, withstand transit through gastrointestinal
track, adhered to intestinal epithelial cell lining and colonize the lumen of the tract 
Produce anti-microbial substances towards the pathogens and technologically suitable
for industrial process and stabilize the intestinal microflora and be associated with the health
benefits 
This module has also taught us to identify safety measures regarding production, manufacture
related to the technological aspects, application, survival, and colonization in the host and
their health benefits to monitor general aspects, functional aspects and health aspects of quality
assurance of probiotics and safety, optimize production aspects, and quality control aspects
Under pro-biotics in various foods, we have studied dairy and non-dairy foods, fermented
while selecting the pro-biotics strains 
Please do attempt self-assessment practice assignment at the end of this module 
This will help you to prepare yourself for final exam and please do not forget to fill
feedback form 
In the next week, we shall start prebiotics namely oligosaccharides and resistant starch 
So, thank you and happy learning experience 
and non-fermented pro-biotic foods 
We learnt the concepts of carrier foods and role of milk and milk fats and pre-biotics
in delivering pro-biotics at the target sites 
Milk and milk fats through their buffering action protects pro-biotics from the harsh
conditions of the gastrointestinal tract 
Ice creams have been used as carrier foods for pro-biotic delivery 
This module also delt upon the non-dairy fermented and non-fermented foods such as vegetable
Hello Learners, welcome to the third week of our course on functional foods and nutraceuticals 
This module shall also deal with the concept of carrier foods, and roll of milk and milk
fats, and prebiotics in delivering the probiotics at the target sides 
Various fermented and non-fermented vegetable and fruit juices and soy production shall
also be discussed 
Certain Probiotic foods commonly consumed will also be discussed 
The module on quality assurance of probiotics and safety shall deal with the conditions 
And criteria for the proper selection of probiotics for their safety 
And desirable benefits and how the ability of prebiotic microbes can be retained during
production, manufacturing, distribution and storage prior to reaching to the consumers 
We have tried to explain to you these topics in a very simplified way 
I hope you have enjoyed learning basic concepts of probiotics last week 
If you find it very difficult please do convey us through our feedback forms 
Please do attempt self-assessment, practice assignment at the time of every module 
This will help you to prepare yourself for final examination and please do not forget

Last week, we have studied probiotics with respect to introduction to probiotics, prebiotics 
And synbiotics, as well as we have studied taxonomy and important features of probiotic
microorganisms 
And health effects of mechanism of actions of probiotics 
In the third week, we shall be studying probiotics in various foods and quality assurance of
probiotics and safety 
Under probiotics in various foods, we shall study diary and non-diary probiotic foods,
and fermentate and non-fermentate probiotic foods 
Hello learners, in this week, we have studied prebiotics namely oligosaccharides and resistant
Fructooligosaccharides are being claimed to improve mineral absorption and decrease phospholipids,
serum cholesterol and triglycerides 
These properties have drawn the interest of food interest industry, for the application
of functional oligosaccharide as partial substitute for fats and sugars in food formulation 
The tenth module on dietary fiber explained its definition, classification, physicochemical
properties, sources, and applications as well as functional foods property 
We learnt that dietary fibers cannot be digested, and absorbed in the human small intestine 
Instead, it can be fermented in the large intestine by colin microorganisms, to produce
short-chain fatty acids which in turn can be absorbed and contribute to human health,
such as anti-tumour and anti-inflammation properties 
starch 
We have also studied classification of dietary fiber, according to solubility in water, as
water-soluble fiber, less fermented fibers namely cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and
water-soluble and well-fermented fibers, such as pectins, gums and mucilages 
This module has also described the role of fiber, in managing blood glucose levels, lipid
profile, Improvement constipation, and weight management, besides laxation, appetite control
and prebiotic effect in producing short-chain fatty acid production 
Dear learners, I hope these modules have cleared your concept of oligosaccharides and dietary
fiber 
In the next week, we shall study two more prebiotics namely resistant starch and gums 
So all the best and happy learning experience 
Hope these modules have given you a deep insight into Prebiotic aspects of these category 
Thank you 
Oligosaccharides is a kind of naturally occurring carbohydrates, that are made up of three to
ten monosaccharide units, linear or branched linked by alpha or beta glycosidic linkages 
We have also studied the functional oligosaccharides namely isomaltooligosaccharides, glucooligosaccharides,
The classification and mechanism of action has also been dealt with 
Besides this fructans and inulins have also been discussed 
In addition for the use as prebiotics to enhance, the growth of beneficial bacteria in colon 
Hello learners, welcome to the fourth week of our course on functional foods and nutraceuticals 
The basic concept of prebiotics has already been explained in the second week, fourth
module 
Prebiotics are mostly fibers that are non-digestible food ingredients, and beneficial effect the
in the colon, generally lactobacilli and bifidobacterium 
We all are aware of carbohydrates and its classification, according to saccharide groups 
You must have studied mono-saccharides, di-saccharides and poly-saccharides in much detailed during
graduation 
But many of you might not have studied oligosaccharides which are made up of three to ten monosaccharide
units, Lenoir or branched linked by alpha or beta glycosidic linkages 
And hope you have enjoyed learning about, probiotics in various foods and quality assurance
Our subject expert doctor Renuka Mainde will explain structure, sources, uses, and their
health benefits of oligosaccharides as prebiotics 
The next module which shall be dealt in this week is dietary fiber 
Dietary fiber is a well-known polysaccharide, among the population because of its role in
prevention of non-communicable diseases namely diabetes, obesity, and cancers 
Our subject expert doctor Renuka Mainde shall explain to you about the classification, sources
and health benefits of dietary fiber as a functional food 
NaN:NaN:NaN
of probiotics and safety last week 
Probiotics in various foods gave us information on dairy and non-dairy probiotic foods and
fermented and non-fermented probiotic foods 
We have also seen some of the commonly consumed dairy-based and non-dairy based probiotic
foods 
The module on quality assurance of probiotics and safety taught us the characteristics of
ideal probiotics, and selection criteria for lactic acid bacteria, to be used as probiotics 
In this week we shall study prebiotics namely, oligosaccharides and resistant starch 
Hello learners, in the fifth week we have  learned about resistant starch and gums,  
and micronutrient absorption, and thermogenesis  The most important aspect of the resistance  
starch, we have studied was effect  of processing on resistance starch  
The twelfth module was on gums  in this module, we have studied different  
sources of gums like plants such as present in  seed code, exudates, microbial such as algae  
Bacteria most of the common gums comes from  exudates, which are secreted by specialized  
cells at the site of injury  To form exudates, which immediately  
solidified on exposure to atmosphere  They serve the plant, to seal wounds  
and prevent infection by microorganisms  We have seen that gum is a good source of  
soluble fiber, and contains calcium,  sodium and a small amount of protein  
It is a complex polysaccharide, primarily  indigestible to both humans and animals,  
which works as prebiotics  We studied that resistant starch as the name  
which is not broken down in the intestine  But undergoes colonic fermentation,  
by colonic bacteria and can cause  alteration of the gum microflora  
Gums have also been found, to reduce oxidative  stress and inflammation of the intestinal mucosa,  
enhances dental remineralization  and nephroprotectant  
Gum arabic has pro absorptive  properties and can be used in diarrhoea  
Thus we have studied four bio  Prebiotics namely, oligosaccharides,  
dietary fibers, resistant starch and gums  From the next week, we shall start studying other  
food components with potential health benefits  Thank you and best wishes 
proposes is the portion of starch, that escapes  the digestive system in small intestine, which is  
resistant to digestion, passes further into colon  Were it act as a substrate for microbial  
fermentation, the end products  being gases, organic acids,  
short-chain fatty acids, our branched as  a short-chain fatty acids and alcohols  
There are four types of resistant starch,  depending upon their characteristics namely  
R S one, R S two, R S three, and R S four  The health benefits of resistance starch studied,  
are improved glycemic  And insulinemic responses, bowel health,  
blood lipid profile, increased satiety  And reduce energy intake,  
Hope, you have enjoyed learning polyphenol module 
Flavonoids specially the flavonols, quercetin and conferol play a powerful role in heart
disease 
by disrupting, the function of microorganisms like viruses or bacteria 
The ability of flavonoids to chalate or bind, metal ions contribute to their antioxidant
activity invitron 
Flavonoids are helpful in inhibiting tumor growth promotion and progression 
Flavonols induce and increase in the growth of lactobacillus species and Bifido bacterium
species 
Module on polyphenol also described catechins 
Let us know conclude, we studied that polyphenols are a group of chemical substances, found
Catechins have been regarded as the characteristic compounds in green tea, for daily beverage
and crude medicine in Asia, especially in China and Japan for thousands of years 
Green tea contains high concentrations of four main types of catechins 
with respect to catechins we have also learn, that they exert anti diabetic activity 
By inhibiting the alpha amylase and Alpha glucosidase activities, inhibiting glucose
absorption in the small intestine 
Protecting the pancreatic beta-cells, improving insulin sensitivity of peripheral organs and
inhibiting gluconeogenesis 
That is glucose production from non carbohydrates, such as amino acids in the liver 
in plants 
Green tea contains various components, with specific Health promoting effects and is believed
to have protective effects against disease 
Such as cancer, obesity, diabetes, hepatitis and nuerodegenerative diseases 
However, conflicting results have also been reported, since confounding factors could
affect the results 
Future studies should eliminate such factors, to better understand the benefit of green
tea for human health 
With this know, we have completed Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth modules on polyphenol,
tannins and catechins respectively 
In the next week, we shall study phytoestrogens, phytosterols and glucosinolates 
Characterized by the presence of more than one phenolic unit or building block or molecules 
Thank you, and happy learning experience 
We have studied structure, sources of flavoinoids such as flavonols and flavones, isoflavones
and flavonols, phenolic acids and derivatives, tannins, still bins and lignins 
The module on polyphenols taught us, that fruits, vegetables, legumes, soy products,
algae are rich sources of dietary flavonoids 
Most of the health benefits of flavonoids are due to their antioxidant activity 
Hello learners, hope you have enjoyed learning phytoestrogens, phytosterols, and glucosinolates 
caused by estrogen deficiency 
The phytoestrogens may be of particular benefit to premenopausal and postmenopausal women 
phytoestrogens may also play a role in fighting cancer 
However, much more research is needed to understand this 
The second module of this week dealt with phytosterols and phytostanols 
Which are compounds found in plant origin foods 
They are structurally associated with cholesterol 
But differ in their structure of the side chain 
Phytosterols have been classified into two types 
Let us now conclude, the module on phytoestrogens taught us that they are plant-based compounds
Sterols which have a double bond in the stereology hence known as unsaturated compounds 
Stanols which like a double bond in the stereology, so are saturated molecules 
We also studied effects on health, which showed that phytosterols may produce health benefits
in animals 
Humans such as reduction of cholesterol levels, with decreased risk of coronary heart disease,
anti-inflammatory activities 
Induction of apoptosis in cancer cells and disease prevention and treatment 
The third module, which we learn was glucosinolates 
This module acquainted us, that glucosinolates are a large group of plant secondary metabolites,
with nutritional effect and are mainly found in cruciferous plants 
that mimic estrogen in human body 
After injection glucosinolates could be partially absorbed in their intact form, through the
gastrointestinal mucosa 
However, the largest fraction is metabolized in the gut lumen 
When cruciferous are consumed without processing myrosinase enzyme present, in these plants
hydrolyzes the glucosinolates 
In the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract, to various metabolites such as isothiocyanates,
nitriles, oxazolidine-2-thiones, and indole-3-carbinols 
Isothiocyanates are potentially anti-carcinogenic 
Phytochemicals that are the result of the metabolism of glucosinolates 
We studied that the health benefits of glucosinolates are antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cancer-protective,
The majority of phytoestrogens found in typical human diets can be categorized into two primary
anti-diabetic, cholesterol-lowering and role in reducing neurodegenerative diseases 
We have also seen, the toxicity that exclusive feeding or excessive feeding of vegetables
or and Seeds 
From the Brassica family has been associated with toxic effects in life stocks, like reduce
fat intake, alterations of hepatic detoxification system 
Enlarge thyroid reduced plasma thyroid hormone levels, occasional organ abnormalities, decreased
growth, decreased reproductive performance and even motility 
Thyroid carcinomas have also been reported in few studies, when thioglycosides, metabolize
to thiocyanates 
We have now completed the seventh-week module on phytoestrogens, phytosterols and glucosinolates 
classes isoflavones and lignans 
In the next week, we shall study carotenoids, anthocyanins, lycopene, and curcumins 
Thank you and wishing you happy learning experience 
Isoflavones makeup, the most common form of phytoestrogens 
Two of the majors' isoflavones found in humans are genistein and dioxin 
In plants, isoflavones are inactive, when present in bound form as glycosides but when
the sugar residue is removed, these compounds become activated 
The phytoestrogens have been found, to be beneficial in combating symptoms and conditions
Dear learners welcome to the seventh week of our online course on functional foods and
And type two diabetes, protection against breast cancer, prostate, and other cancers 
In this module, we shall study in detail about definition, structure, classification, sources,
and health benefits of phytoestrogens 
We are also going to learn about phytosterols and phytostanols, which are Foods of plant
origin 
Phytosterols have a similar structure as cholesterol but they differ in the structure of the side
chain 
As phytosterols are found in only plant foods, the foods containing phytosterols are usually
healthy foods like unrefined plant oils, vegetable, nuts and olive oils 
They have been known to reduce the incidence of coronary artery disease and serum cholesterol
nutraceuticals 
content 
The other health benefits of phytosterols are increase in immunity and anti-carcinogenic
effects 
Let us now know more phytosterols and phytostanols 
This module highlights, the types of phytosterols, structure, sources 
Its absorption mechanism, properties and perspectives for food applications of plant sterols and
stanols 
The third module in the seventh week is glucosinolates 
These are a large group of sulfur-containing glucosides present in cruciferous vegetables,
belonging to Brassicaceae family 
Hope you have enjoyed learning polyphenols, tannins and catechins in the last week 
Cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, mustards, rapeseed, canola etcetera, are the examples
of cruciferous vegetables 
These vegetables are said to be protective against cancers of lungs and elementary tract 
The popularity of brassica products is increasing because of their nutritional value, anticancer,
antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties 
In this week we shall study in detail about definition, structure, classification, sources
and Health benefits of glucosinolates 
In this week we shall study phytoestrogens, phytosterols, and glucosinolates 
Phytoestrogens also known as dietary estrogens are naturally occurring compounds, found in
plants which have a structural similarity to the female sex hormone 
Phytoestrogens may be beneficial for women looking to rebalance their hormone, as they
approached menopause 
Various other beneficial health effects have been ascribed to phytoestrogens 
Such as a lowered risk of cardiovascular diseases, obesity, metabolic syndrome 
Hello learners, now let us conclude,  
cranberries, raspberries, blackberries,  and red and black grapes, and blueberries  
Anthocyanins inhibit the initiation,  promotion and progression of several cancers  
Such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, and liver  cancer by inhibiting several signalling pathways,  
involved in tumour growth and apoptosis  We have learned that lycopene is a lipid-soluble  
compound, consuming it with fat  increases its bioavailability  
Numerous studies have specified that lycopene is  an active antioxidant and free radical scavenger  
Lycopene, because of its high  number of conjugated double bonds,  
exhibits higher singlet oxygen quenching ability  Lycopene has also shown promising results in  
controlling and preventing prostate cancer  We also studied the role of lycopene in  
controlling coronary artery disease, diabetes  management, skin health prevention of oxidative  
in the eighth week we have studied carotenoids,  and anthocyanins, lycopene, and curcumins  
damage and does control of degenerative diseases  The module on curcumin taught us,  
that it is a major source of the polyphenol  The bright yellow, orange colour of turmeric comes  
mainly from fat-soluble polyphenolic  pigments, known as curcuminoids  
Curcumin, the principal curcuminoid  found in turmeric is generally  
considered its most active constituent  It assists in the management of oxidative  
and inflammatory conditions, metabolic syndrome,  arthritis, anxiety, and hyperlipidemia  
It may also help in the management of  exercise-induced inflammation and muscle soreness  
Most of these benefits can be attributed to  its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects  
Curcumin has been identified as one of  the major natural anti-cancer agents,  
exerting antineoplastic activity  in various types of cancer cells  
We have learned that carotenoids are present in  yellow and orange-coloured vegetables and fruits  
With this, we have completed  modules of the eighth week  
In the next week, we shall study  organosulfur compounds and introduction to  
Alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and  beta-cryptoxanthin are provitamin A carotenoids  
Lutein, zeaxanthin, and lycopene  are non-pro vitamin A carotenoids  
Presence of fat improves the  availability of carotenoids  
An adequate intake of carotenoids rich fruits  and vegetables are carotenoids supplements  
May significantly reduce the risk of  some chronic diseases, such as cancer,  
cardiovascular, and photosensitive disorders  The another pigment we studied is anthocyanins  
The module described that the chief sources  of anthocyanin are red onion, red cabbage,  
Dear learners welcome to the eighth week of our online course on functional foods and
This module will enable you to learn about chemistry, structure, food sources, effects
of processing, and metabolism, bioavailability, and health benefits of carotenoids 
We shall also been studying anthocyanins 
Anthocyanins are normally found in flowers and fruits of many plants 
Most of the red, purple, and blue colored flowers contain anthocyanins, the color pigments
of anthocyanin from berries, blackcurrent and other types of red to blue colored fruits
are strong antioxidants 
Moreover, anthocyanin reached black carrot, red cabbage, and purple potato are prospective
functional foods that have been consumed for prevention of diseases 
nutraceuticals 
In this week we shall be learning about anthocyanin, its chemical structure, metabolism, bioavailability,
food sources, and health benefits 
Lycopene is the red colored pigment abundantly found in red color fruits and vegetables such
as tomato, papaya, pink grapefruit, pink guava, and watermelon 
Tomatoes and tomato based products contain the highest concentrations of bioavailable
lycopene 
This module explores enabled learners to understand chemistry, structure, metabolism and bioavailability
of lycopene and health benefits of lycopene 
The next module will be curcumin 
Turmeric has spice derived from Riesel of the tropical plant Curcuma longa 
Hope you have enjoyed learning phytoestrogens, phytosterols, and glucosinolates in the last
Curcumin the principal curcuminoid found in turmeric is generally considered its most
active constituent 
In addition to its use as a spice and pigment, turmeric has been used in India for medicinal
purposes for centuries 
This module of curcumin will enable you to learn about chemical structure, absorption,
sources, bioavailability, and effects of processing on curcumin 
You will also be learning about the important aspects such as health benefits of curcumin

In this week, we shall study carotenoids, anthocyanins, lycopene and curcumins 
The first module of our eighth week is carotenoids and anthocyanin 
Carotenoids are the class of more than seven hundred fifty naturally occurring pigments
synthesized by plants algae and photosynthetic bacteria 
These richly colored molecules are the sources of yellow, orange, and red colors of many
plants 
Dear learners, now let us conclude 
Which inhibited carcinogenesis in the stomach, colon, breast, and lung of experimental animals 
Allium vegetables and organosulfur compounds are those possible cancer preventives agents 
Hope you have enjoyed learning on this sulfur-containing functional foods 
We have also studied anti-nutritional factors which are secondary plant metabolites cause
depressions in growth performance 
And animal health due to a verity of mechanisms including reducing protein digestibility,
binding to various nutrients Or damaging the intestinal wall thereby lowering
digestive efficiency 
Anti nutritive can also cause toxic effects by causing nutritional deficiencies and interference
with the functioning and the utilization of nutrients 
In this week, we have learned organosulfur compounds, introduction to anti-nutritional
These anti-nutritional factors are classified as type A that is anti proteins, type B that
is anti minerals, and type C that is anti vitamins 
Anti proteins include protease inhibitors, lectins
and hemagglutinin  Anti minerals are phytic acid, oxalic acid, dietary fibre and gossypol 
And anti vitamins include ascorbic acid oxidase, anti thiamin factors and anti pyridoxine phytus 
This module acquainted you with the brief introduction of these anti-nutritional factors
and the methods of removal from the foods 
In this week, we have also learned about phytates 
Phytates widely occurs in whole grains, legumes, seeds, and nuts 
In mature cereal grains, legumes and oilseeds the major portion of the total phosphorus
factors, and phytates 
is present in the form of phytic acid 
The possible beneficial effects of food phytates include lowering of serum cholesterol and
triglycerides and protection against certain diseases 
Such as cardiovascular diseases, renal stone formation, and also against colon and breast
cancers 
Phytates also showed positive effects on blood glucose and blood cholesterol 
Thus we have studied organosulfur compounds, and introduction to anti-nutritional factors,
and phytates 
In the next week, we shall study enzyme, protease inhibitors and amylase inhibitor 
Thank you and happy learning experience 
The module on organosulfur compounds thought us that organic compounds containing carbon,
sulfur bond are technically term as organosulfur compounds 
They can be derived from both plants and animal sources like cruciferous vegetables, garlic,
onion, meat, eggs and fish 
They exert certain therapeutic benefits which include antimicrobial,
anti-fungal,

saponins, and hemagglutinins 
In this week we shall study about an introduction to anti-nutritional factors in foods and phytic
acid 
welcome to the ninth week of our online course on functional foods and nutraceuticals 
Anti-nutritional factors are present in foods that we consume regularly, as a whole wheat,
other whole grains, legumes, and soy beans 
Household processes such as soaking, and fermentation, and cooking removes or inactivate manure of
the anti-nutritional factors 
It is important, therefore to be aware of their adverse as well as beneficial effects 
Compounds are substances which act to reduce nutrient intake, digestion, absorption, and
utilization 
And may produce other adverse effects are referred to as anti-nutrients or anti-nutritional
factors 
We shall study meaning classification and some examples of anti-nutritional compounds
Hope you have enjoyed learning carotenoids, anthocyanins, lycopene, and curcumins in the
or substances 
Phytates, the salt of phytic acid is widely distributed in the plant kingdom 
For decades phytates has been regarded as an anti-nutrient as it may inhibit the absorption
of some essential trace elements 
And minerals and may lead to calcium, iron and zinc deficiencies 
So in this week, we shall study phytates and anti-nutritional factor 
last week 
In this week we shall study organic sulfur compounds, and introduction to anti-nutritional
factors in foods, and phytates

In this week, I have decided to teach you chapter seven 
Chapter seven is devoted to the study of or to find the solution of partial differential
equation using integral transform 
This chapter is divided into five modules 
I shall teach you first three modules in this week 
integral transform 
I shall define mainly five integral transforms 
Depending on the functional form of Kernel, there are different types of integral transforms 
Now, I am going to start Module four of Chapter seven  This module is devoted to the application of
discuss Mellin transformation and its application to partial differential equation 
This transformation has already been defined in module one of this chapter  Historically,
Riemann first recognized Mellin transformation in eighteen hundred seventy six in his famous
an elaborate discussion on this transformation  Now, we are going to slide presentation for
the explanation of this transformation 
Now, we shall show how Mellin transformation can be used to solve the problem where we
need to find potential in an infinite which where the potential phi satisfies the Laplace
equals to zero  And we also have zero less than r less than infinity, and theta lies
The corresponding inverse Hankel transformation is f r equals to integration zero to infinity
in this way 
So, this is the infinite which and this is bounded by the line theta is equal to minus
phi tilda and the variable smaller is transformed to the variable p 
Now, the Mellin transform of r square phi r r equals to, according to definition zero
to infinity r square phi r r into r to the power p minus one dr  So, this is zero to
infinity r to the power p plus one d two phi dr square dr  Again we are using integration
bi parts where r to the power p plus one is taken as first function and del two phi del
r square is taken as second function  So, first function into integration of second function
minus integration of derivative of first function which is p plus one into r to the power p
and integration of second function del phi del r dr 
Now, if we assume that del phi del r tends to zero as r tends to infinity, then the first
term becomes zero  So, it becomes value of the integral becomes minus p plus one integration
function minus integration of derivative of first function  That means p into r to the
power p minus one into integration of second function phi dr 
equation, here we are deriving some important result  Now, what will be the Hankel transformation
If we again assume that phi tends to zero as r tends to infinity, then the first term
gives zero and value of the integral can be written as p into p plus one integration zero
to infinity r to the power p minus one phi dr  And this integral is nothing but phi tilda
find the Mellin transform of r phi r, so this is nothing but integration zero to infinity
r phi r, r to the power p minus one dr  So, this is zero to infinity r to the power p
d phi dr dr 
In the next line we are applying integration bi parts, taking r to the power p as our first
function and d phi dr as our second function  So, the value of the integral is r to the power
p into phi zero to infinity minus derivative of first function p into r to the power p
minus one to integration of second function phi dr  We have already assumed that phi goes
to zero as r tends to infinity  So, the first term is zero and the second term gives minus
p into phi tilda p theta, where phi tilda is the Mellin transform of phi 
Therefore, Mellin transform of r square phi r r plus r phi r plus phi theta theta is
equals to zero  So, after simplification, we can write the equation in the form phi tilde theta
theta plus p square phi tilde equals to zero  So, this is a second order ordinary
Suppose we have the boundary conditions phi r alpha equals to f r, phi r minus alpha equals
to g r, where r goes from zero to infinity  Now the Mellin transform of the ever boundary
presented here  So, its Hankel transform is equals to according to definition, integration
conditions give, the first boundary condition gives phi tilda p alpha equals to f bar p 
And the second boundary condition gives phi tilda p minus alpha equals to g bar p where
So, using the condition ten and eleven, we can write that a cos p alpha plus
b sin p alpha equals to f bar and a cos p alpha minus b sin p alpha equals to g bar 
And so this two are two linear equations in variables a and b  So, it is easy to solve
these two equations  So, solving these two equations we get the values of a and b as
follows, a equals to f bar plus g bar by two cos p alpha and b equals to f bar minus g
bar by two sin p alpha 
Now, substituting the values of a and b, the solution becomes phi bar equals to f bar plus
g bar by two cos p alpha into cos p theta plus f bar minus g bar by two sin p alpha into sin
p theta  After simplification we can write it as equal to f bar into sin p
theta plus alpha by sin two p alpha plus g bar sin p alpha minus theta by sin two
h bar p alpha minus theta, where H bar p theta is the function which is defined as sin p
theta by sin two
of h bar p theta  So value of h r theta is equals to one divided by two pi i integration
c minus i infinity to c plus i infinity r to the power minus p  This is the expression
f whole multiplied with J nu xi r dr 
for h bar p sin p theta by sin two p alpha into dp  This is a contour integration, so
value of this contour integration can be obtained using the complex analysis 
And it can be verified that its value is equals to one divided by two alpha r to the power n
sin n theta divided by one plus two r to the power n cos n theta plus r to the power two n,
where n is equals to pi divided by two alpha or two alpha equals to pi by n 
bar plus g bar into h bar  So, value of phi can be obtained taking inverse Mellin transform
of phi bar p theta  So, which is written here  So, phi is equal to inverse Mellin transform
of phi bar p theta 
So this equals to inverse Mellin transform of f bar p into h bar p alpha plus theta plus
Now, I am doing the integration separately  The first part, which is d two f dr square
we get phi is equal to r to the power n cos n theta by two alpha integration zero to infinity
xi to the power n minus one f xi divided by xi to the power two n minus two r xi to the
power n sin n theta plus r to the power two n d xi plus integration zero to infinity xi
to the power n minus one g xi by xi to the power two n plus two r xi to the power n sin n theta
plus r to the power two n 
So, this is the part which comes for the, from the function f and this part comes from the
our required solution and we obtain this solution using Mellin transformation  Thus,
in Module four of Chapter seven, we have discussed about application of Hankel transformation
and Mellin transformation to find solution of a partial differential equation 
We have used Hankel transformation to find solution of heat equation in polar coordinate system 
It is also possible to find solution of wave equation in polar coordinates system using
Hankel transformation  The derivation is available in e text  We also applied Mellin transformation
to solve waves problem  Apart from these problems, there are many physical problems where we
can use these two transformation to find solution of a differential equation  Now, we end this module 
two f dr square as our second function as the rest part r into J nu is taken as our
Hankel transformation and Mellin transformation  The Hankel transformation and Mellin transformation
first function  So, according to the rule, first function into integration of second
integration of second function df dr dr 
Now, if we assume that the term within the square bracket is zero for the limits r equals
to zero and r equals to infinity, then the above expression reduces to the form minus
its value is minus ddr of r J nu into f 
are named according to the great mathematicians Hankels and Mellin respectively 
so first function into integration of second function  And then integration of derivative
of first function into integration of second function  So, that gives the expression which
is written in the first line of this slide  Again we are assuming the term within the
square bracket is zero for r equals to zero and r equals to infinity  So,
of r J nu into f dr 
infinity is equal to, again we are assuming df dr as our second function  So, first function
Hankel is a German mathematician  He is famous for his work in mathematical analysis, which include
J nu into integration of second function which is f over the limit zero to infinity minus
integration of derivative of first function that is ddr of J nu into integration of second
function f dr 
So, if we assume that the term within the square bracket is zero, then it simplified to the form
that means the Hankel transform of the equation or the expression d two f dr square plus one
of r J nu minus ddr of J nu minus nu square by r into J nu dr 
Hankel transformation  In Hankel transformation Bessel function is used as the kernel 
nu dr  Now, the expression within the square bracket for these expression we substitute
nu square by p square into J nu 
that expression from this equation  This is Bessel differential equation of order nu 
So, the value of the expression in the square bracket it is d two dp square of J nu plus
one by p ddp of J nu minus nu square by p square J nu p  so from this equation the value
of this expression is minus J nu p  So, substituting the value of this expression,
A large number of axisymmetric problems in cylindrical polar coordinate systems are solved
to infinity r fr J nu dr 
And according to the definition of Hankel transform, this is nothing but Hankel transform
can be represented by the equation which you can see here del u del t equals to kuppa del
two u del r square plus one by r del u del r, where r ranges from zero to infinity and
t is the time variable which is greater than zero  And we also have the initial condition
using Hankel transformation  Now, we are going to our slide presentation  The Hankel transform
u r zero equals to capital U, where capital U is a constant for zero less than r less
than a and its value is zero for r greater than a 
equals to minus xi square u zero bar, where u zero bar is the Hankel transform of order
zero of u  So here, the variable r is transformed to the variable xi 
And it is easy to find the solution of this equation which is a first order ordinary differential
equation, so its solution is u zero bar is equal to a into e to the power minus xi square
of ordered nu and parameter xi of a function f r, where zero less than equals to r less
to capital U for zero less than r less than a equals to zero for r greater than a  So, if you
apply Hankel transform to this condition, it gives u zero xi zero equals to integration
and here we have also used the formula integration of x J zero is equal to J one  Now, in the
in the general solution if we put t equals to zero, we get its value left hand side is
U J one by xi and right hand side is a  So it gives the value of a  Therefore a is equals
to U J one by xi 
equals to U J one a xi by xi into e to the power minus xi square t 
But, we are interested to find the variable u as function of r and t  So, to get u as function
of r and t, we need to apply inverse Hankel transform  So, using the formula for inverse Hankel
transform, we get the value of u as u equals to integration zero to infinity xi
So, this is the term, this is nothing but u zero bar  So, xi u zero bar into J zero 
So, this integration value of this integration will give the value of u  So, this equals to
since capital U is a constant, so you can take out capital U from the integration 
So, the value of the integral is capital U times zero to infinity e to the power minus xi square
In module one of chapter seven, we have defined different types of integral transform 
over n u s bar sin n pi x by a 
Now, substituting the value of u s bar, we obtain our required solution u s two by a
Multiplied with sin n pi x by a  And in this solution, it is to be noted, that this f bar and g bar
are the finite sin transform of the functions f t and g t respectively  So in the next line,
we are substituting the values of f bar and g bar  So, substituting those values, the solution
becomes this which you can see in this slide 
I have already told that Hankel’s transformation is used to solve axis symmetric problem in
cylindrical polar coordinate system  The finite Hankel transformation is used to find temperature
distribution in a long circular pipe, where radius vector r is a finite number  The method
Fourier sine transform of a function fx is denoted by f bar s n is equal to integration
of finite Hankel transform was first introduced by Sneddon in nineteen forty six  Now, we are
going to the slide presentation for the derivation 
I have already defined Hankel transform  But, here I am defining finite Hankel transform
first kind, where xi i are the positive roots of the transcendental equation Jnu a xi i
equals to zero  The inverse finite Hankel transform is defined as f r equals to two
the derivative of J nu 
Before applying finite Hankel transform, I am deriving some important result  First of all
zero to a fx sin n pi x by a into dx 
I want to derive the Hankel transform of the operator d two f dr square plus one
by r df dr minus nu square by r square f  So according to definition, the Hankel transform
of this expression is equals to zero to integration zero to a r d two f dr square plus one by
r df dr minus nu square by r square f into J nu r xi i dr 
the term in the square bracket is zero  So the value of the integral becomes minus integration
df dr as our second function and the dash term as our first function, we obtain the
expression which is written in the next line 
r xi i, so here we are taking derivative of the term d dr of, we are expanding this term
derivative of the Bessel function J nu dash r xi i into derivative of r into xi i which
Now, using the condition J nu a xi i equals to zero, the value of the expression becomes
df dr J nu r xi i dr  We again applying integration bi parts
We obtain the finite Hankel transform of the expression d two f dr square plus one by r
So, in this using that transformation, the term in the square bracket in the last line
of the last slide, can be written in terms of p as xi square into d two dp square of J nu
plus one by p d dp of J nu minus nu mu* square by p square into J nu  And the dash
terms are written in terms of the variable r  Now, there is an objective to transform
the Bessel equation  The Bessel equation is d two d p square J nu plus one by p d dp
of J nu plus one minus nu mu* square by p square J nu equals to zero  Therefore, the
value of d two dp square J nu plus one by p d dp of J nu minus mu square by p square
J nu is equal to minus J nu 
So, in this integral, we substitute the value of the expression in the square bracket as minus
the first integral, this is nothing but the finite Hankel transform of the function f r 
dash into f a 
That you can see in equation eight  And this relation holds for all nu greater than equals
to zero  So in particular we can take the value of nu as zero  Therefore, H zero i of
shall use finite Hankel transform to solve heat conduction equation 
The heat conduction equation is given by in polar coordinate system is given by the equation
which is written in one del u del t equals to kappa del two u del r square plus one by
r del u del r where r varies from zero to a  And the boundary condition is given u at
a t equals to zero  The initial condition is u r zero equals to f r  Now, we want to apply
finite Hankel transform, for that we first take finite Hankel transform of the
given equation 
So, we multiply the equation by r into J zero and then we integrate it over integration
zero to a  And we obtain the equation for u zero bar which you can see in the first
here, this term becomes zero  So, the equation reduces to the form which is
written in equation number ten 
And this equation, in this equation u zero bar is the finite Hankel transform of order
The initial condition three says that u at t equals to zero is f r  So, if you take zeroth
Now, the problem is now to find the solution of equation ten together with the initial
condition which is given by equation number eleven and the solution of equation ten, if
you see the equation ten, this is a first order ordinary linear differential equation 
So, its solution is u zero bar equals to f zero bar into e to the power minus kappa xi
i square into t, where we have used the initial condition u zero bar at t equals to zero is
of n into cos n pi x by a 
equal to f zero bar  So, this is the solution of equation ten 
this stage, we applying inverse finite Hankel transform  So, according to that formula its
value is equals to two by a square sum over i f zero bar e to the power minus kappa xi
So, if you substitute that value we get the required solution which is written in the
last line of this slide  Thus, in module five of chapter seven, we have applied finite sine
transform to solve heat equation and wave equation  Similarly, finite cosine transform
can be used to solve the same equations  We have also applied finite Hankel transform
Now, we are considering a physical problem where we shall use Finite Fourier sine transformation 
In the definition of those integral transform, we have taken at least one of the limits of the integral as infinite 
to find solution of heat equation  Finite Hankel transform can be used to find solution
of wave equation 
The derivation is available in E-text  At the end of this module, I want to mention
that finite integral transform is essential to match the theoretical outcome with the experimental results 
Now, we end this module 
we have to solve heat conduction problem where there is a rod of finite length and the heat
distribution is given by the equation del u del t equals to kappa del two u del x square
where x varies from zero to a and t greater than zero  The boundary
condition is given by u at zero t equals to ft and u at a t equals to zero
for t greater than zero  And it is also given that value of f zero is zero  And the initial condition
is u x zero equals to zero, for zero less than equals to x less than equals
given equation one 
But in reality, there are some situation where we need to
Now, if we see the left hand side of this expression we inter change the differential operator
and the integral operator in the next line  So left hand side is equals to del del t
side, the value of the integral in the right hand side using integration by parts  So for that,
So,
value of this integral is given by kappa sin n pi x by a into integration of second
function that is del u del x limit zero to a minus derivative of first function that
gives cos of n pi x by a into n pi by a into integration of second function is del u del
do some experiment in a box  So for that case, the space variable is no more infinite 
bi parts taking cos n pi x by a as our first function and del u del x as our second function 
So, value of the integral becomes minus kappa n pi by a u cos n pi x by a and limit is zero
So that is u s bar equals to integration zero to a u into sin n pi x by a dx 
Therefore, it is relevant to consider finite integral transform  Thus, module five of chapter seven
and this is a first order equation  So solution of this equation can be obtained easily
pi by a integration zero to t f tau e to the power minus kappa n square pi square by a
square t minus tau d tau 
Now, we want to get u as function of x and t  So, we have to transform the variable n
is devoted to find solution of a partial differential equation using finite integral transform 
kappa n square pi square by a square into t into sin n pi x pi a integration zero to
t f tau e to the power kappa n square pi square by a square into tau d tau 
is given by del two u del t square equals to c square del t u del x square  Obviously here we have
considered a one dimensional wave equation and u satisfies the initial
conditions u at t equals to zero is f x and del del t of u at t equals to zero is g x 
And we also have the boundary conditions u at x equals to zero is zero, u at x equals
to a is also zero 
Again we take Fourier transform of the given equation, so for that we multiply the both
The entire module is divided into two sections  In first section we shall discuss about the
obtain the relation which you can see in this slide  In the left hand side, we interchange
the differential operator and the integral operator  So, the left hand side is equals
to del two del t square of integration zero to a u sin n pi x by a into dx 
So, this is nothing but u s n t  Now, if you evaluate the right hand side, we are applying
integration bi parts, taking del two u del x square as the second function and sin n
Now, if you apply the boundary condition on x equals to zero and x equals to a, then
In this type we again apply integration bi parts taking del u del x at second function
solution using finite sine or cosine transform  In second section, we shall discuss about
term becomes zero if we apply the supplied boundary condition  And the second term can
be written as which is given here and the value of the integral is defined as finite
sine transform of u  So, it is denoted by u s bar n t 
Therefore, the given equation reduces to the, to an ordinary second ordered differential equation
and its solution can be written as combination of sine function and cosine function,
the values of a n and b n, we again takes finite Fourier sine transform of the initial
g x  So, finite Fourier transform of this initial condition gives u s n zero
equals to f s bar 
the application of finite Hankel transform  Now we are going to the slide presentation
sine transform of the function f t and g t respectively  And I have already mentioned
initial conditions to the general solution four, we can immediately find the values of
So, substituting this values of a and a n and b n in equation four, we obtain the expression
of x and t, we need to apply inverse Fourier transform  So, in the next step, we apply inverse
In last few chapters, we have derived solution of a partial differential equation as an infinite series 
value of del del n of this quantity is one by epsilon square, and d sigma
is epsilon square sin theta d theta d phi 
take out the term u r from the integration  So, this is u r  Integration of sin theta
d theta d phi, over this surface sigma plus order of epsilon term  And after integration
we obtain its value is four pi  Therefore, value of the integral u del del n of u dash
is equals to four pi u r plus term of order of epsilon 
the values of all term, del u del n becomes del u del n plus order of epsilon and value
shall discuss some properties of Green’s function  In addition, we shall derive Green’s
of one by mod r minus xi is one by epsilon and value of d sigma is epsilon square sin
theta d theta d phi 
So, after simplification you can see that this values of this integral is of order epsilon 
u into del del n of one by mod r minus xi dS 
So, from this expression, and we obtained this expression considering epsilon tends to zero 
So, from this expression, you can see that, the value of u can be obtained at an arbitrary
function for Laplace equation  In module two, we shall discuss about the Green’s function
which is written in equation number fifteen  And to find value of u at P, we need to know
we can find u at a arbitrary point P 
Similarly, in case of exterior Dirichlet problem, we can obtain a relation which is
normal derivative on the surface S  But, let us try to think the problem in some different way 
Now, we consider a function which is known as Green’s function, which is of the form
and we also assume that the function capital H is harmonic  That means, H will satisfy
the Laplace equation, which is written here del two del xi square plus del two del eta square
for solving heat equation and wave equation 
plus del two to del zeta square operating on H equals to zero on V  And we also assume
that the function G is such that the value of G is equals to zero on the surface S 
So, if G satisfies this condition, the function G is called Green’s function 
of u at r can be written in the form, which you can see in equation number eighteen  Now,
in equation sixteen and seventeen and it is also given that G is zero on S  So, if we use
that condition, equation eighteen reduces to the form equation nineteen 
integral of u del G del n ds 
Now, we are going to the first slide show of module one  Before going to the discussion
Hence, the solution of Dirichlet problem is reduces to that of determination of Green’s
function capital G  So, in this form in this solution, we don't need to know the value
of normal derivative of u in the surface S 
So, this is the advantage of finding solution in terms of Green’s function  Now, I am
going to discuss some properties of Green's function  It has one important property that
Green’s function G which is function of two variable the vector r and vector xi it
is symmetric about these two variables 
equal to H plus one divided by mod r minus xi where H is a harmonic in V  Therefore,
on Green’s function, I am first defining our spatial function which is called Direct
As you can see in this figure, we have taken two points, two different points P one and
P two, having position vectors r one, r two respectively within the region capital V and
S is the boundary of the region capital V 
We assume u one as G at r one xi is equal to H at r one xi plus one divided by mod r
S and nabla square of G at r one xi is equal to minus four pi delta r one minus
Now, this is our famous Green's theorem which convert the volume integral to the surface
delta function  The Direct delta function which is denoted by delta x minus xi, y minus
are substituted in the next step 
And if you see the right-hand side, that means, the surface integral which you can see in
this slide, is value is zero on S because, by assumption G r one xi is equal to zero
delta r one minus xi dv equals to zero 
Now, this integral can be separated  So, the first integral value of the first integral
is G r one r two and the value of the second integral is G r two r one  And, this value
eta, equals to zero for x not equals to xi and y not equals to eta, into this is direct
can be obtained using the property of delta function  Therefore, these equation gives
G r one, r two is equal to G r two r one  So, this says that the function G is symmetric
with respect to the argument r one and r two 
the Green's function G be continuous, and its normal derivative del G del n be discontinuous
equal to one  Now we know the property of Green's function as nabla square G is equal
to delta r minus xi 
nabla square G dv equals to one  Now, if you take the limit epsilon tends
delta function in two variables 
to zero, then its value will remain same volume integral of nabla square G d v equals to one 
Now, this volume integral can be converted to the surface integral using the divergence
theorem  So, it gives that limit epsilon tends to zero surface integral of del G del n
Thus, in Module one of chapter eight, we have learned how to find solution of a non-homogeneous
partial differential equation using Green's function  We have also taken a homogeneous
equation  For example, we took Laplace equation to find its solution using Green's function 
There are many linear differential equations, which can be solved using Green’s function method 
Thus, we end this module 
where R epsilon is the region x minus xi whole square plus y minus eta whole square is less than
It is also possible to find solution of a partial differential equation as integral
third property which is very important, we shall use this property to find solution of a PDE 
x minus xi y minus eta dx d y is equal to f xi, eta for arbitrary continuous function
f in the region capital R  The delta function is a symbolic function and is often viewed
eta dx dy is equal to f xi eta 
And if we see the result three and four, we can conclude that delta x minus xi into y
superposition in terms of an auxiliary function which is known as Green’s function 
have shown that Direct delta function in dimension two can be written as product of Direct delta
function in one dimension  Now, these results can be generalized  If x is n dimensional
that delta x vector minus xi vector is equals to delta x one minus xi one, delta x two minus
xi two into dot dot delta x n and minus xi n 
Suppose, we have a non-homogeneous partial differential equation, which is written in
equation number seven  Lu X equals to a f X, where capital X has components x y, z,
and L is an arbitrary linear partial differential operator  And f x is some known function 
And we want to find the value of u x for which equation seven is satisfied  Now, we shall
show how can we introduce the concept of Green’s function to find solution of seven 
The advantage of taking integral solution of a partial differential equations are as follows 
of delta function 
Now, if we see the left-hand side of this relation L is an operator, which is operated
on function of capital X only  So, we can interchange the operator L and the integral
operator in equation nine  So, the left-hand side of equation nine become L operating on
Firstly, the integral representation helps us to visualize the analytical structure of the solution,
square bracket can be assumed as our u x or our required solution 
Therefore, solution of the given equation, which is written in equation number seven
the Green’s function, and it's play the role of a kernel in this integration 
using Green’s function  In the last section, we have discussed how to find solution of
a non-homogeneous partial differential equation using Green’s function, but it is also possible
to find solution of a homogeneous equation using Green’s function  In the present section,
we are going to derive Green’s function solution of Laplace equation 
Now, we are going to our slide presentation  First, we are considering an
which may be obscured in an infinite series solution  Secondly, it
interior Dirichlet problem  Suppose, the values of u and del u by del n where del u del n represents the
normal derivative of u are known at every point on the boundary S of some finite region
capital V  And it is also given that u satisfies the Laplace equation nabla squared u equals
to find the value of u at the point capital P, that is u at P  For that purpose, we surround
here, O is the position of origin and P is the point inside v and OP is the vector small
is sometimes easy to evaluate the integral compared to find the sum of an infinite series 
the region V minus sigma and S dash be the boundary of the region V dash 
order derivatives on the surface S, then using Green’s theorem, we can write that volume
integral of u nabla square u dash minus u dash nabla square u is equals to surface integral
u is equal to nabla square u dash is equal to zero within V minus sigma  Therefore, left
Thus, chapter eight is devoted to the study of Green’s function 
eleven, this s dash is nothing but union of surface S and small sigma 
So, these surface integrals can be written as integration over s, u del u dash del n
minus you dash del u del n d s plus surface integral over sigma of the same quantity is
next step, we substituted the value of u dash  So, the integral becomes surface integral
Using Green’s function, we shall find solution of a partial differential equation  The entire
as d sigma equals to r epsilon square sin theta d theta d phi 
if we substitute the values of x y z here, it takes the form which you can see here 
Now, think about this integral  Surface integral on sigma u del del n of one by mod r minus
chapter is divided into two modules  In module one, we shall define Green’s function, we
In module one, we have defined Green's function  We have also obtained Green's function solution
minus theta  So, it is written here  So, G equals to half of 
So, if we use the expression for PQ here, and we have already obtained the expression
for P dash Q in the previous slide  Here you can get the expression for P dash Q  And here
we obtain the expression for P Q  So, if we substitute those values here, the expression
for G becomes half ln a square plus r square xi square by a square minus two r xi cos phi
minus theta divided by r square plus xi square minus two r xi cos phi minus theta 
boundary is a circle  So, outward <?></?> normal is in the direction of xi  So, del del n is
equivalent to del del xi  So, del G del n at xi equals to a is equal to del del xi of
G at xi equals to a  And it can be computed from the derived expression from of G and
u equals to some known function f, which is function of y, z on the boundary x equals
its value becomes r square minus a square divided by a into a square minus two ar cos
phi minus theta plus r square 
the expression for del G del n on the circle xi equals to a  So, you substitute that expression
here and we have to substitute the value of u on the surface bounding surface  That means,
we have to substitute the value of u on the circle 
So, if that is given as small f, then u at r theta can be written as s square minus r
square by two pi a integration zero to two pi f phi d phi by s square minus two a r cos
to zero  And we also have the bounded solution that means, u tends to zero as x tends to
phi minus theta plus r square  In this section, we shall solve wave equation using Green’s
function  First of all, we shall prove Helmholtz theorem  Then we shall solve space form of
wave equation using appropriate Green’s function  Now, for derivation we have to go to the slide presentation 
Partial_Differential_Equations_971
continuous partial derivatives of first and second order in a region V which is bounded
by the closed surface S and these U satisfies the Helmholtz equation nabla square plus c
square operating on u equals to zero  Then surface integral of one by four pi exponential
infinity  Now, we want to solve this problem using the method of Green's function 
region V and the value of this expression is zero if r is outside the region v 
First, we shall prove this theorem  Let u r be the solution of the Helmholtz equation,
which is written here nabla square u plus c squared equals to zero  And we also assume
that all singularities of u lies outside the region V and we take the expression for u
dash as e to the power i c mod r minus xi divided by mod r minus xi  Now, this is famous
Green's theorem  Now, in this theorem, we substitute this particular expression for u dash 
square u is equal to it becomes volume integral v, so here we are substituting the expression
So, in this method, we need to construct a function G, which is known as Green's function,
these two function cancel out, and the value of the volume integral becomes zero 
So, if we go back to equation five, the left-hand side becomes zero  And the right hand side
is surface integral of u del del n of e to the power i c mod r minus xi by mod r minus
xi, minus e to the power i c mod minus xi by mod minus xi into del u del n  Now, if
is denoted by capital sigma and the surface of the sphere is denoted by small sigma  Then
we can apply the Green’s theorem in the region D minus sigma 
So, the left-hand side of that theorem will become zero for the region  So, if we call
back equation five, the left hand side will be zero for the region V minus sigma and the
right hand side will be the surface integral over the surface, which is the boundary of
V minus sigma that means these surface integral is to be evaluated in the surface S union small sigma 
del n of this minus u dash  Del u del n is equal to zero  Now, for this case on sigma,
is equal to n is the outward <?><?> normal
to the surface sigma  So, for this case it is del del epsilon  So, if we compute these,
its value is ic minus one by epsilon into e to the power i c epsilon by epsilon 
by mod r minus xi, number two, the function H is such that, it is harmonic in xi space 
finally, i c minus one by mod r minus xi into e to the power ic mod r minus xi by mod r
equals to minus of surface integral over sigma ic minus one by mod r minus xi u minus del
u del n of u dash 
Now, we want to simply simplify the expression in the right-hand side of equation seven 
Now on sigma u xi is, is equal to u r plus order of epsilon term and del u del n at the point
xi equals to del u del n at the point r plus order of epsilon terms  And on sigma we can write
elementary surface as dS is equal to epsilon square sin theta d theta d phi  See
if we substitute these, in this expression in the right hand side of equation seven,
Therefore, del two del xi square plus del two del eta square plus del two del zeta square,
it becomes which you can see in this slide, surface integral over sigma ic minus one by
mod r minus xi, ur plus order of epsilon minus del u del n at the point P or r minus one
by epsilon into the u dash term into d S, this is, epsilon squared sine theta d theta d phi 
First, we have to, we want to take the zeroth order of the term, then the order of epsilon terms 
So, after simplification from this term, you can see that the zeroth order term is integration
over sigma u sin theta d theta d phi and the rest terms are of order of epsilon 
Therefore, it can be written as again on sigma, we know the value of theta and phi theta varies from
zero to pi, phi varies from zero to two pi 
So, after integration it becomes minus four pi and the rest of the terms are of order
operating on H must be equal to zero 
epsilon  So, if you take epsilon tends to zero, then we can establish, we can get the
left-hand side of the integration  In this term, the left-hand side is the surface integral
over s and the right-hand side we just obtained its value is minus four pi u plus order of
epsilon term  So, if we equate this two term and taking epsilon tends to zero limit, we
its value is zero 
for Helmholtz equation  So, for that, the function G has to satisfy the following conditions,
it will satisfy the Helmholtz equation which is written in one and also G is a finite and
continuous with respect to both the variables r and xi  So, we can replace the exponential
And there is third condition on Green's function, which is, the value of the Green’s function
term by G in equation eight  So, if you observe equation eight we are replacing this term by G 
So, the expression becomes u r equals to one by four pi surface integral of G del
u del n minus u del g del n dS 
So, in this equation you can observe that to find the value of u, we need to find the
value of both u and its normal derivative on the surface  But to minimize that condition,
we choose Green's function  So, in the Green’s function we choose G in such a way that the
value of G is equal to zero on the surface  Therefore, the above equation reduces to the
choice of G we obtain that G will satisfy the Helmholtz equation, G is a finite and
continuous with respect to the variables r and xi and G is equal to zero on the surface
G is equal to zero on the boundary and for this case the boundary is x equals to zero 
of Laplace equation  In module two of chapter eight, we shall derive the particular expression
S  Therefore, G is the appropriate Green’s function for the Helmholtz equation 
Now, we want to find the particular expression for Green’s function for this particular
equation is valid in the half-space z greater than equals to zero  We want to solve this
problem choosing appropriate Green's function 
is our region where we want to find the Green’s function, z greater equals to zero, P is a
particular point in this space 
And P dash is the image of P with respect to the plane z equals to zero  So, if P has
Cartesian coordinates x y z, then P dash must have but Cartesian coordinates x y minus z 
And, we also assume Q is a variable point in that space in the space z greater than
equals to zero 
And xi vector is equal to xi eta zeta  And you can verify that if Q lies on the plane
z equals to zero, then mod of rho minus xi is equal to mod of r minus xi  And the expression
for G, which in this case, we are assuming in the form e to the power ic mod r minus
xi divided by mod r minus xi minus e to the power ic mod rho minus xi divided by mod rho
minus xi  Where, rho is the image of r with respect to the plane z equals to zero 
So, under boundary z equals to zero, mod of rho minus xi equals to mod of r minus xi 
del G del n is equals to delta G minus del g del xi on del g del zeta on zeta equals
to zero  And we can obtain the expression for mod r minus xi, which is in terms of Cartesian coordinates 
It's written here and we can also find the value of mod rho minus zeta
square 
And we can obtain the value of minus del g del zeta, at zeta equals to zero  It can be
calculated  It's very easy to compute  So, we can compute that and after simplification,
you can get the value of this expression as two into del del z of e to the power ic r
eta square plus z square 
in the space and xi has the component, xi eta zeta, and which is the point Q 
from here, you obtain that from equation nine  Here we have substituted the
value of del G del n  And, here we have also used the value of u on the surface S, which is
f for this problem  So, this is our required
solution  Thus, in Module two of chapter eight, we have derived the expression of Green's function
for Laplace equation in two different geometries  Those are half-space and in a circle  We have
also derived the Green’s function solution of wave equation  We also derived the expression
of Green’s function for heat equation in half-space  Apart from that, it is also possible
to find the expression of Green’s function or the Green’s function solution of heat equation 
Now, we want to find the value or the expression for Green's function using the method of image 
The derivation is available in E-text  It is to be noted that the expression for
Green's function depends on the equation and boundary condition and also the geometry of the problem 
Now, we end this module 
For that, we consider a point P dash  Having position vector rho be such that, it is image
of the point P about the plane x equals to zero  So, if we see the figure corresponding
figure  So, this is XYZ plane, and the boundary of the space is x equals to zero 
And the Laplacian equation is defined in the space, where x is greater than equals to zero 
So, in the Space X greater than equals to zero P is a peaks point having position vectors
small r and q is a variable point in that space having position vector xi and we have
for Green's function, to solve Dirichlet problems in half space and in a circle  In addition
considered P dash with position vector rho such that P dash is the image of the point
P about a plane x equals to zero 
Now with this choice of P dash, we choose the expression for the function capital
H as capital H is equals to minus one divided by mod rho minus xi  So, if we choose this condition,
the expression for capital G becomes capital G is equals to minus one by mod rho
minus xi plus one by mod r minus xi  Now, with this particular choice of capital H,
the value of capital G becomes zero on x equals to zero, because the value of mod rho minus
xi is equals to the value of mod r minus xi on the plane x equals to zero  In addition
to that, this expression for capital H will satisfy the Laplacian equation, which is given
by condition number two in this slide  That means, nabla square H is equals to zero for
to Laplace problem, we shall also derive Green's function solution of wave equation 
this particular choice of capital H 
Therefore, we can take the expression for Green's function for this particular problem
have obtained the expression for Green's function  To find the value of u or the solution of
Laplace equation in terms of Green's function can be written as u r equals to minus one
the direction of the normal is outward direction to the surface S 
So, for this case the surface is x equals to zero  Therefore, del del n is nothing but
minus del del xi  So, the value of the integration becomes one by four pi integration minus infinity
First, we shall derive the expression for Green’s function of Laplace equation in
to plus infinity, integration minus infinity to plus infinity f del del xi of, this is
plus y minus eta square plus z minus zeta square  These represent the quantity
one by mod rho minus xi d eta d zeta 
that we have to find the value of del G del n on the surface S  That means in the last
line we have to find the derivative of del del zeta of the expression which is written
in curly bracket on the surface x equals to zero means, it is to be computed at the value
or at the point xi equals to zero 
half space  For the derivation, we are going to the slide presentation  To describe the
So, after simplification the expression for u becomes u equals to x by two pi double integration
three by two which is given by equation number one  Thus, we can obtain the solution of Laplace
equation in half space using the concept of Green's function 
solution of Dirichlet problem  That means, the value of the unknown function u is given
in the circle  So, if we see this figure, P is a fixed point inside the circle having
So, these are the polar coordinates of the two points  And P dash, now we choose a point
Dirichlet problem in a half space, we considered the half space x greater equals to zero, where
OP into OP dash equals to a square  So, this is definition of inverse point of a point
with respect to a circle  Therefore, from this definition, we can find the polar coordinates
of P dash as a square by r theta  Now,
we construct Green's function for this particular problem as G equal to H plus log
we have to go back to the figure  So, from this figure, you can see the value of P dash
Q square is equal to OQ square plus OP square minus OQ into OP into cos of
angle between OP and OQ, which is for this case is phi minus theta 
x varies from zero to infinity, y and z lies between minus infinity to plus infinity 
So, we have written that expression here, P dash Q square is equal to this  Now, if
we put the values of OQ, which is xi square and O P dash is a to the power four pi r square
r square P dash Q square is, so we multiply the expression by r square  So, it becomes
xi square r square plus a to the power four minus two xi r a square cos phi minus theta 
Then we divide the expression by a square  So, we get the value of r square P dash Q
square by r square as xi square r square by a square plus a square minus two xi r cos
phi minus theta 
Now, if we take the square root of that expression and we obtain the expression for capital H
as capital H is equal to half of log xi square r square by a square, plus a square minus
So, in this problem we have to find the value of the unknown function u, where u satisfies
that nabla square of H is equal to zero  And with this choice of H, the expression for
That means for r equals to a, the expression for G becomes G equals to log of r, for r
equals to a the P dash Q becomes PQ 
So, those two factors cancel out and factor within the log becomes one  That means the
value of G becomes zero on r equals to a  Therefore, with this choice of G it satisfies
value or the expression for PQ  So, for that we use the geometry  So, value of PQ square
the Laplacian equation nabla square u equals to zero, where x greater equals to zero and
Now, I am going to start chapter nine  This chapter consist of only one module and this
and tau is function of t only 
function phi and function tau and if we assume minus lambda as separation constant, we obtain
the equation for phi as the Helmholtz equation which is given in equation ten  And the equation
corresponding eigenfunction  Therefore, Laplace square phi n plus lambda n phi n equals to
So, let us consider the equation Laplace square plus lambda u equals to zero in some region capital
equal to zero for m not equals to n, which is given by equation thirteen 
combination of the eigenfunction of the Laplacian operator  So, u is represented as sum over
that means to equation seven, we obtain a relation which you can see in equation fifteen
left hand side is sum over n Cn double dot plus omega n square Cn into double integration
R with the boundary condition u equals to zero on C, where C is the boundary of the
Now, these are the eigenfunction and we know that these eigenfunctions from orthogonal
set, so using that orthogonality property this reduces to phi Cn,
where norm of phi n square is the double integration over R mod of phi n square dx dy 
condition, the initial condition is given in equation eight, where value of u at time
t is equal to zero is f and del u del t at time t equals to zero is g  So, if we use
region capital R 
n equals to f and sum over n Cn dot zero phi n equals to g 
Now, in the first expression you can see that this is the eigenfunction expansion of the
function small f  Now, using the orthogonality property of eigenfunction phi n, we can find
over the region capital R  Similarly, using the orthogonality property of eigenfunctions,
we can derive the values of Cn dot at zero is equal to one by norm phi n square double
Now, if we look back the equation sixteen, so this is a second order ordinary differential
equation  Now, to find the solution of this equation, we need two initial conditions 
So, those two initial conditions are given by equation eighteen  One is the value of
Now, in this equation you can see that u is equal zero is a solution of this system 
Cn zero and the another one is the value Cn dot zero 
omega n t minus xi d xi  Here, we obtain this solution using the method of variation of
parameters  In this method, we first write the solution Cn t in the form An cos omega
n t plus Bn sin omega n t, then we vary the parameter An and Bn, that means assuming An,
Bn as function of t we then derive the solution in this form 
the initial conditions  That means using the values of Cn at time t equals to zero and
Cn, ddt of Cn at time t equals to zero  So Using those two initial condition, it is easy to
And that solution is a trivial solution of the given equation  Now, apart from trivial solution,
And in this equation, all the quantities are known  An, Bn they are given by these two
is given by equation seventeen  And we also know the eigenfunction phi n  So, this is
the eigenfunction solution of two dimensional non-homogeneous wave equation  We have already
defined eigenvalue and eigenfunction of a Laplacian operator  We have also shown how
to find solution of a partial differential equation in terms of eigenfunction 
Now, in this section, we are going to derive how to find solution of Poisson equation using eigenfunction
there may exist some non trivial solution u of the above system for some particular
and Green's function  Now, we are going to slide presentation 
Suppose we are going to solve two dimensional Poisson’s equation, which is given by Laplace
square u equals to f together with the boundary condition u equals to zero on the boundary
C of the region capital R  And we want to solve this problem using eigenfunction and
Green's function  If capital G is the Green's function of this problem, then it will satisfy
Laplace square G equals to delta function of x minus xi, y minus eta, where x, y belong
then Laplace square plus lambda into phi equals to zero in R and phi is equals to zero on
C  Let lambda mn are the eigenvalues and phi mn are the corresponding eigenfunctions 
values of lambda  And those particular values of lambda are called eigenvalues of the operator
And we also assume that the Green's function of this problem can be written as linear combination
of xi and eta into phi mn 
values of b mn  So, the values of b mn can be written as b mn equals to one divided by
the property of <?>direct</?> delta function, the value of the integral is phi mn xi, eta 
Laplace square in the region capital R  And the solution u corresponding to a particular
And we know that lambda mn are the eigenvalues of the operator Laplace square and phi mn
mn are the eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator and phi mn are the corresponding eigenfunction 
Therefore, the equation twenty four holds  Now,
eta, from this expression we substitute the values of G and delta in terms of the eigenfunction 
Laplace square of this is the expression for capital G and this is the expression for,
right hand side is the expression for direct delta function in two variables 
value of lambda is called the eigenfunction 
Now, if we interchange the summation and the Laplacian operator, then this Laplacian is
mn phi mn  So, we substituted that value here  So, in the last line we obtain minus lambda
mn sum over m, sum over n a mn into phi mn equals to, in the right hand side we substituted
the values of b mn, which we obtained in the previous slide 
So, these are the values of b mn  So, b mn equals to phi mn by norm of phi mn 
the orthogonality property, we can find the value of a mn as minus phi mn by lambda mn
into norm of phi mn square  Thus we can find the eigenfunction expansion of the Green's
module is devoted to find eigenfunction solution of a partial differential equation  The chapter
Therefore, for this particular problem, we can obtain the value of Green's function in
terms of eigenfunction of the Laplacian operator  And in chapter eight, we learned how to find
solution of a non-homogeneous equation in terms of Green's function  There we learned
Here, we use double integration because we are solving two dimensional Poisson equation 
If it is three dimensional problem, then instead of double integration, it would have been
a triple integration  So, value of u can be obtained using formula twenty seven,
Thus in chapter nine, we solved a partial differential equation using eigenfunction
method  We mainly defined eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a Laplacian operator  Using
Similarly, one can define Neumann eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, when
the eigenfunctions of Laplacian operator, we solved Laplace equation,
Poisson equation and wave equation  In the similar way, one can define eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
different operator to solve different type of partial differential equation 
Now, we end this module 
instead of u, if the normal derivative of u is prescribed on the boundary C of the region capital R 
a partial differential equation  For that purpose, we are considering the Helmholtz
equation in 2D  So, in this problem, we have to solve the equation del two del x square
plus del two del y square plus lambda u equals to zero in some region capital R 
For this particular problem, we have considered capital R as a rectangle of sides a and b 
zero, y equals to zero, u a, y equals to zero for zero less than equals to y less than equals
to b and u x, zero equals to u x, b equals to zero for zero less than equals to x less
is divided into three sections  In the first section, I shall define eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
than equals to a 
First, we are solving this problem using the method of separation of variables  So, for
that we write u as product of X and Y where capital X, capital Y are functions of small
x and small y respectively  Substituting this expression for u in the Helmholtz equation,
double dash plus mu square X equals to zero and Y double dash plus nu square Y equals
to zero, where X double dash and Y double dash represent the second order derivative
of capital X and capital Y with respect to small x and small y respectively 
And if we apply the boundary conditions, it gives the value of capital X at zero and a
is equal to zero and value of capital Y at zero and b is equal to zero  And there is
of a Laplacian operator  In the same section, we shall develop the concept of eigenfunction
a relation between lambda and the separation constant mu square and nu square, which is
given by lambda equals to mu square plus nu square  And the solution of x equation can
to n pi by b, where m and n are integers 
n, that’s why we use the suffix mn  So, lambda mn equals to pi square into m square
by a square plus n square by b square  And the solution or the eigenfunction is defined
n are integers one, two, dot, dot 
taking one example where we shall solve Helmholtz equation 
positive numbers and they form a countable set of real numbers, accumulating only at
infinity  And it is to be noted that the smallest eigenvalue which is denoted by lambda one
one, which corresponds to m equals to one and n equal to one, it has the eigenfunction
eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue lambda one one  But for other values of lambda,
it is possible that it may corresponds to more than one choice of m and n 
to ab by four if m equals to m dash, n equals to n dash and its value is zero if m not equals
m dash, n not equals to n dash  That means the state of function u mn are orthogonal 
In the second section of this module, we shall find eigenfunction solution of a non-homogeneous
The value of the constant A mn can be obtained using the orthogonality property of the sine
series 
Thus, the Fourier series five may be considered as an expansion in eigenfunctions of two 
So, in this way we can represent a function f x, y in terms of the eigenfunction of the
operator which is given here  Or in terms of the Laplacian operator 
Now, we want to generalize the concept of eigenvalues <?>of</?> eigenfunction  The general
wave equation  Lastly, in section three, we shall find the solution of non-homogeneous
This is equation one  So, the general eigenvalue problem can be studied in many different ways 
One of them is the use of Green's function, where the solution can be written in the form
the properties of Green's operator, we can obtain the values of lambda and the
corresponding eigenfunction u  There are another method using which we can obtain the eigenvalues
and eigenfunction of the given Laplacian operator  The collection of all eigenvalues lambda n
is called the spectrum of the Laplacian Laplace square  And the subject where we study
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an operator is known as spectral theory  And this is important
branch of mathematics 
Laplace equation or Poisson equation  Now, we are going to the first slide of this module 
In this section, we shall solve two dimensional non-homogeneous wave equation  First, we shall
solve homogeneous wave equation with the help of eigenfunction  Then we shall try to write
the solution of non-homogeneous equation in terms of those eigenfunctions using the method
of variation of parameters  Now, we are going to the slide presentation 
del two u del t square minus c square into del two u del x square plus del two u del
y square equals to capital F x, y, t  And we have the initial conditions, u x, y at
time t equals to zero is equal to f x, y and also del u del t at time t equals to zero
is given by the function g x, y  We also have the boundary conditions B u equals to zero
on the boundary C of the region capital R 
We have the idea of eigenvalue and eigenfunction of a matrix  Now, I am going to define eigenvalue
for that case u equal to zero on C, if it is a Neumann condition, then the
normal derivative of u that is del u del n equals to zero on C, or it may be mixed type
boundary condition or in other words Robin condition for which u plus del u del n equals
to zero on C 
wave equation, where we have considered the right hand side of equation seven, which is
of separation of variables  First we separate the space variable from time variable  So,
we assume u as product of phi and tau, where phi is function of space variable x and y
and eigenfunction of an operator  Here, we are taking the Laplacian operator 
In last few chapters, we have discussed about linear, elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic equations 
divided by one plus t F dash xi, where capital F is c of small f 
one plus t F dash xi is not equals to zero  And also it is to be noted that the solution
Now,
using the previous result, we can arrive to a theorem which is stated here in the slide 
The non-linear initial value problem del u del t plus c u del u del x equals to zero,
four, is devoted to the study of Burger's equation  Finally, in module five, we shall
it will reduce to the linear wave equation four and the solution of this curve or the characteristic curves
xi equals to x minus ct, therefore u is equal to f of x minus ct 
Physical interpretation of solution is always important because it helps us to visualize
a particular phenomena  In this section, we shall give geometrical interpretation of the
solution which we have obtained in the last section  Now, we shall show, that how solution
represent a shock wave  Now, this is the time to go the slide presentation 
First of all, we assume that c dash t u is function such that it is positive  And we
discuss about non-linear Schrodinger’s equation and solitons  Now, we are going to the first
know that, the graph of u at time t is equal to zero is the same as that of the function
And the distance moved depends on xi  But here I want to mention that, in this case,
the point which have the lower value of u 
there will be a distortion of the wave or the structure or the shape of the wave and
slide of module one 
that will result a shock wave  And this is due to the non-linear character of the equation 
quantity del u del x and del u del t becomes infinite 
Before going to the discussion on non-linear wave equation, let me start with the linear
x equals to xi plus t F xi and this characteristic also persist through
it cannot be a negative quantity  Therefore, F dash xi must be a negative quantity 
So, if we assume that c dash f is greater than zero, then small f dash xi must be less
will cease to exist for all time, if the initial data is such that f dash xi
is less than zero for some value of xi 
wave equation in one dimension  The wave equation in one dimension is given by del two u del
the first singularity develops, the value of f dash xi must be numerically largest 
Since, f dash xi is a negative number, we have to find the minimum of f dash xi for
xi minus infinity to plus infinity 
So, for first singularity, tau is equals to minus one divided by minimum of c dash f into
f dash xi, where xi varies from minus infinity to plus infinity  Of course, this tau must
be greater than zero because this represent a particular time  If the graphs of non-linear
t square equals to c square del two u del x square, where t is the time variable and
So here, this is our x axis, this is u axis and this is time axis  So, at time t equals
the points will move faster than the points which have the lower value of u 
solution will not exist and this particular phenomena is known as shock waves and this
is the characteristic of a non-linear differential equation  So, in this wave, we can show that
how shock waves generates or how can we get shock wave solution from a non-linear first order
differential equation or rather we can say from a wave equation 
Thus, in module one of chapter ten, we have introduced simplest first order wave equation 
x is the space variable 
We have also introduced non-linear first order wave equation  The solution of first order
wave equation is a shock wave which is completely a non-linear phenomena  Thus, we end this module 
And solution of this equation can be written easily  The general solution of equation one
The function representing phi denotes a wave which is propagating in the positive direction
However, in nature there are many phenomena such as shock waves, soliton waves,
of x axis, where the function psi denotes the equation of a wave which is propagating
in the negative direction of x axis 
c into del del x operating on u equals to zero  So, the simplest linear wave equation
can be written as del u del t plus c into del u del x equals to zero 
And the solution of this equation is u equals to phi x minus ct, where this represent a
wave moving with the constant velocity c in the positive direction of x axis without change
of shape  So, in this way, one can represent wave equation which is of first order and
linear, which is given in equation number four 
pattern formations, etcetera cannot be explained in terms of linear differential equation 
In our last slide, we got introduced with the linear first order wave equation 
In the coming slide, we shall discuss about the non-linear first order wave equation and using that equation,
we shall generate the concept of shock waves  This type of particular equation arises to
explain non-linear wave equation when the effect of dissipations are neglected 
Now, we are going to the slide presentation 
x equals to zero  In the earlier slide, c was a constant, but for this case, c is now
is function of u  Therefore, equation five is a non-linear equation  And we have also
the initial condition u at time t is equal to zero is equal to f x, for minus infinity
Therefore it is important to study non-linear partial differential equation  In this regard,
the initial condition six 
the linear differential equation, the principle of superposition cannot be applied to solve
this non-linear equation  Number two, the entire nature of the solution can be changed
due to non-linearity 
And study of the above initial-value problem reveals some important ideas for non-linear
parabolic waves, which cannot be observed in case of linear equation  And a large number
of physical and engineering problems can be dealt with the above non-linear system or
its extension  Therefore, the study of the above equation, that means equation five together
with the initial condition six is important 
I want to mention that finding solution of a non-linear differential equation is not
Now, we shall use the method of characteristic to find the solution of equation four 
Now, we consider the total differential of u which is du  Since u is function of t and x, so
it lies on a curve gamma whose slope at any point P is given by dx
del u del x 
which is given in equation number five  So, the solution of equation five is equivalent
easy because in this case, the principle of superposition does not hold  Therefore, chapter
And dx dt equals to the slope of any member of the curve on gamma, therefore dx dt equals to c u represent the slope
curves of the equation five  Thus the solution of the partial differential equation five
is equivalent to solving two simultaneous ordinary differential equations seven and eight 
But if we observe equation seven, we can find solution of this equation as u is equal to
eight  Then we can solve equation eight as x equals to c u t plus another constant 
The general solution of equation five depends on finding the family of lines, each line
ten is devoted to the study of non-linear partial differential equation 
So, if xi be the initial point on the characteristic curve gamma and if one of these curves gamma
intersect t equals to zero at x equals to xi, then u xi, zero equals to f xi on the
whole of that curve gamma  That you can see in this figure  So, at time t equals to zero,
x equals to xi and at the same point, the value of u is f xi  In this figure, you can
see one characteristic which is denoted by gamma 
simultaneous ordinary equation as dx dt equals to c u, where value of x at the point zero
or time t equals to zero is xi  And du dt equals to zero, where u at time t equals to
We divide the entire chapter into five modules  In module one, we shall discuss about non-linear
zero is f xi 
that in this equation, dx dt equals to F xi and if we solve this equation together with
the solution of ten can be written as small x equals to t F xi plus xi 
Now, this represent the characteristic curve which is a straight line whose slope is not
constant but depends on xi  And this is the characteristic of non-linear, solution of
a non-linear differential equation  In case of linear differential equation, it would
have been constant  Therefore, the solution of the initial value problem in parametric
form can be represented as u is equal to f xi and x equals to xi plus t F xi, where capital
one dimensional wave equation  In module two, we shall discuss about the phenomena of dispersion
Now,
to verify this, we take differentiation, take derivative of u with respect to both
x and t  We get del u del x equals to f dash xi into del xi del x and differentiation with
respect t gives del u del t equals to f dash xi into del xi del t and the second equation
we again take differentiation with respect to x and t separately  So, it gives, one equals
dash xi into del xi del t 
to f dash xi divided by one plus t capital F dash xi and if you eliminate del xi del
and dissipation  Module three, deals with the discussion on KdV equation and module
Now, I am going to start module two of chapter ten  This module is devoted to the discussion
square minus alpha plus beta by four del u del xi plus alpha minus beta by four del u
del eta minus gamma by four u equals to zero 
e to the power alpha plus beta by four into eta minus alpha minus beta by four into xi 
lambda is equal to alpha square minus beta square minus four gamma divided by four 
Now, if we come back to the original co-ordinate system x and t, our required solution is u
is equal to w into e to the power beta by two into x minus alpha by two into t, where
is a constant  These type of waves are called non-dispersive waves 
Partial_Differential_Equations_1586
zero  But if alpha greater than zero then, the energy will dissipate 
integration del u del t square plus del u del x square plus gamma u square dx 
Now, if you take the time derivative of the energy, so here we have taken the derivative of u,
so right hand side is del u del t del two u del t square plus del u del x del two u
del x del t plus gamma u del u del t 
Now, we take common the term del u del t from first and third term, so that gives del u
del t into del two u del t square plus gamma u plus del u del t into del two u del x del t 
So, for non-dispersive wave, phase velocity c is constant  For dispersive wave, c is equal
In the third line, we substituted the value of del two u del t square plus gamma u from
the given equation 
Then after some simplification, we obtain the last line, where the value of dE dt is
equals to minus alpha integration del u del t whole square dx  The value of the integral
del u del t whole square dx is a positive quantity and we have assumed that alpha is
a positive number 
So, the equation says that dE dt is less than zero, less than or equals to zero for alpha
greater than zero  That means, the energy will decrease with time or in other words
energy will dissipate  And this dissipation, for this dissipation, the term alpha is responsible 
Therefore, in the equation, if we go back to the original equation or equation number
to some function of wave number k  Now, what is the difference between a dispersive wave
nine, so in this equation the term alpha represent the dissipation of energy 
At the beginning of this module, we have started with a linear one dimensional wave equation 
And from that equation, we discussed the phenomena of dispersion and dissipation  We also relate
the terms which are responsible for dispersion and dissipation 
Now, I am going to discuss the domain of dependence of the solution of general wave equation 
We consider the Cauchy problem of non-homogeneous wave equation  So, the problem is given by
del two u del t square minus del two u del x square equals to f x, t  Since f is present,
the equation is called non-homogeneous  And this is the Cauchy type problem, that means
the values of u and its time derivative del u del t are prescribed at initial time, that
and a non-dispersive wave? Suppose there is a non-sinusoidal disturbance and we know that
And we have already derived the solution of this type of equation  And the solution is
given by u at P, P is a fixed point in x-t plane and which has co-ordinates x and t,
We want to find the value of u at the point P 
so h is prescribed along the interval Q to R and value of the integral f over the region
by the lines PQ, QR and RP 
this type of disturbance can be written as combination of sinusoidal waves  Now, for
this domain and this domain is called the domain of dependence  It is to be noted that,
the domain D 
where the characteristic through P intersect the x axis and D is the domain bounded by
this characteristic and x axis  The closure D bar is the domain of dependence of inhomogeneous
wave equation 
our equation nine  So, if we compare this equation with the inhomogeneous wave equation,
non-dispersive wave, since the velocity of all waves having different wave numbers are
for that we need to take the term alpha del u del t plus beta del u del x plus gamma into
u to the right hand side of this equation 
So, if we compare equation nine with the inhomogeneous equation, we can write in this form del two
u del t square minus del two u del x square equals to some function capital F, which is
minus alpha del u del x minus beta del u del t minus gamma u  So, this is the expression
for capital F for equation one 
same, for this case, the shape of the disturbance will remain same with time 
if you observe the solution, the solution u at the point P depends on the value of u
also, which is in the double integral 
Therefore, the solution for this case cannot be written in explicit form  However, if we
think about the domain of dependence of u, we can see that u depends only on the behaviour
of Cauchy data in the interval Q, R and the functions alpha, beta, gamma and f in the
domain capital D 
Thus, the domain of dependence of equation one coincides with the domain of dependence
of equation fourteen  Therefore in module two of chapter ten, we have discussed the
phenomena of dispersion and dissipation taking a simple wave equation  We have also obtained
the domain of dependence of that equation  Now, we end this module 
On the other hand, in case of non-dispersive wave, the shape of the non-sinusoidal disturbance
will not remain same with time  And this particular phenomena is known as the phenomena of dispersion 
In this section, I am going to discuss about this phenomena, taking simple wave equation 
on two important phenomena, namely the phenomena of dispersion and dissipation  Now, I am going
First, we take one dimensional wave equation which is written in one  del two u del t square
minus del two u del x square plus alpha del u del t plus beta del u del x plus gamma u
equals to f x, t, where t greater than zero, t represent the time variable and the parameters alpha, beta, gamma
these are functions of x and t  In particular, they may be constants 
we are going to solve equation two, where there is one extra term lambda into u in the
one dimensional wave equation  Now, we look for a solution which is called the uniform
The function three is called the uniform wave because, it represents a wave propagating
to tell few words about the phenomena of dispersion  Suppose we have a one dimensional wave equation 
with constant velocity c equals to omega by k 
Now, if lambda equals t zero, we can prove the value of omega is plus minus k and the
solution becomes u is equal to x plus ct plus g into x minus ct, so which is nothing but
solution of wave equation  Now, if lambda not equals to zero, then if you substitute
plus lambda phi equals to zero, where phi double dash represent
then lambda by omega square minus k square should be a positive number  So, for that
case, the solution can be written in simple form which is given in equation number four 
So, phi which is function of kx minus omega t is equal to A into e to the power i kx minus
The equation is given by del two u del t square equals to c naught square del two u del x
square minus k square equals to lambda or omega k equals to plus minus square root k
square minus lambda  And this relation is called dispersion relation  So, dispersion
relation gives us omega as function of k, which is given in equation number five 
So, In case of non-dispersive wave, lambda equals to zero and for that case, omega k
equals to plus minus k  So, for non-dispersive <?>wave</?>, we can say that omega is equal
k  And this is called the phase velocity  I have already defined phase velocity  And
in case of dispersive wave, you can see that c is not now a constant  This is function
square, where c naught is a constant 
Since, the uniform wave is dispersive when lambda not equals to zero and non-dispersive
when lambda equals to zero  The additional term or the zeroth order
the lambda into u term or the addition of zeroth order term gives rise to a
of these waves is represented in equation six  So, u t is represented as linear combinations
That means we can prove that the six or u having expression which is written in six,
Now, we want the solution of this equation in traveling waves form  So, the solution
will satisfy the equation two, provided omega j equals to omega j some function of kj and
omega j equals to plus minus square root kj square plus lambda, where lambda is not equals to zero 
If lambda is not equals to zero, the terms in six, corresponding to different kj will
We can generalize this, taking continuous limit  Of course the limit will exist as j
tends to infinity  So, for that case, we obtain the Fourier integrals, u equals to integration
minus infinity to plus infinity A k e to the power i kx minus omega k t dk  Here omega
is not constant  This is function of k and you can show that such solution is also dispersive
for lambda not equals to zero 
can be written as u is equal to f of kx minus omega t, where k is the wave number and omega
as half of integration minus infinity to plus infinity del u del t square plus del u del
x square plus lambda u square dx  So, this denotes the total energy of the system 
del u del t, this corresponds to kinetic energy, del u del x is corresponds to potential energy
and this is the total energy 
Now, if you take the time derivative of u, that means if we differentiate eight with
is the frequency of the wave  Now, if we substitute this solution to the equation, we obtain that
this phase velocity is always constant 
In this section, we shall discuss about the phenomena of dissipation  Dissipation is defined
as a process where energy is transformed from one form to the other  The example of dissipation
process is friction, heat transfer, etcetera  It is an irreversible process  Some, scientist
defined dissipation process as the conversion of mechanical energy to the heat energy 
In case of wave motion, dissipation means decrease in amplitude 
In this section, I shall discuss the dissipation process taking an example of wave equation
and in the wave equation, we shall relate the term which is responsible for dissipation 
the phase velocity of the wave which is defined as small c is equal to omega by k equals to
Now, we are going to the slide presentation 
To explain the phenomena of dissipation, we take the homogeneous part of equation one
del two u del t square minus del two u del x square plus alpha del u del t plus beta
del u del x plus gamma u equals to zero  And in this equation, we considered alpha, beta, gamma
shall show that the constant alpha corresponds to the dissipation 
the co-ordinates to characteristic direction xi equals to x plus t and eta equals to x
minus t  And in terms of xi and eta, the equation nine is transformed into del two u del xi
c naught for this case  That means for a linear wave equation, c equals to c naught which
﻿In module two of chapter ten, we have  discussed the phenomena of dispersion   
And they can overtake the shorter one and can  emerge from the interaction without change of  
shape  And this is one of the  characteristic of the solitons  
and these solitons interactions show that the  solitons behave like elementary particles   
And this phenomena can be  observed only in KdV equation   
So, the earlier one was some particular  solution, now I am going to obtain a  
general solution of the equation  So we, if we go back to equation six,  
so in this equation in the first case we  assume that particular solution for which  
A equals to zero B equals to zero   Now, we are not assuming A B as zero  
but we are thinking about a bounded  solution and which oscillates between zero,  
between zero and alpha  So, we are  seeking a real bounded solution,  
such as plasma waves, magneto hydrodynamic  waves and the wave with long wave lengths   
so for that f dash square must be  greater than equals to zero   
And it varies monotonically until f dash equals  to zero and it has you can see this is a cubic  
equation in f so it has three roots  Since we are  thinking about the real solution so this three  
roots must be real and we are also interested to  find I have already told the oscillatory solution  
which oscillates between zero and alpha  So,  without any loss of generality we choose f one as  
to alpha minus beta which is a negative number   So, zero less than alpha less than beta   
Thus, from equation eleven we obtain one  third h zero square f dash square equals to f  
into alpha minus f into alpha minus f minus  alpha plus beta  Taking square root both side  
we obtain equation twelve, where capital U is the  
Therefore, we divide the entire module into  some sub-sections  In section one, we shall  
velocity of the wave which is given by the  relation which you can see in the slide   
Now, to find the value of this integral we  put alpha minus f as alpha into q square   
Now, we are changing the variable from f to  the variable q so with this substitution the  
integral in the right hand side becomes d  q by one minus q square into one minus m  
square q square whole to the power half, where  m is equal to alpha by beta to the power half   
And this is the famous elliptic integral,  
so its solution can be written  in terms of Jacobian sin function  
so q equals to s n of three beta by four  h zero square to the power half into X, m,  
where m denotes the modulus of the  Jacobian elliptic function sn z, m   
first introduce the KdV equation   Then we shall solve this equation  
square  So, if we substitute that alpha into one  minus q square we obtain the value of f which is  
written in equation fourteen  So, the solution  is now in terms of elliptic cosine function  
and this cn z, m is called the Jacobian  elliptic function and it is of modulus m,  
where we have used the relation cn square  z equals to one minus sn square z   
It is to be noted that, this c n  function is a periodic function  
since cn is periodic f x becomes periodic  therefore the solution of the KdV equation  
becomes periodic and the period P can be obtained  from equation thirteen from here we can find the  
value of the period as P equals to which is  written here in equation number fifteen   
Let that period equals to lambda where k m is  the complete elliptic integral of first kind  
and which is defined as k m equals to integration  zero to pi by two one minus m sin square theta  
assuming traveling wave solution  Finally, we  shall give or tell about the conservation property  
to the power minus half d theta   So, therefore the general solution  
a nonlinear wave whose shape and wavelength  depend on the amplitude of the wave    
So, if you draw the picture you can see and this  wave is called cnoidal wave, this is periodic in  
Now, I shall discuss two particular cases of  the general solution  If you take m going to one  
that means alpha goes to beta  or alpha is equals to beta,  
then this c n z function becomes sech hyperbolic  z function and the cnoidal wave solution fourteen  
it represent the classical solitary  wave with wavelength lambda   
And which approaches infinity due to this property  K one equals to infinity and K zero equals to pi  
of KdV equation  Now, we are going  to the slide show of this module    
sin function and cn z goes to cos function, it  becomes cos function and the solution becomes  
f x equals to the solution can be written in terms  of sine function and cosine function and with this  
substitution k equals to square root three beta  by h zero  That means beta equals to this   
This transform the value of f X as alpha  by two into one plus cos k x minus omega t   
equals to U into k and this is the dispersion  relation for the small amplitude wave equation  
and from this dispersion relation you can  find that these first two terms are similar  
to the first two terms of the dispersion  relation in water wave problem    
In this section I shall discuss about  conservative properties of KdV equation   
First I shall introduce KdV equation which is  the short form of Korteweg -de Vries equation   
The KdV equation itself is in conservative  form, in late nineteen sixties Miura  
et al discovered that there are infinite number  of integral of motion for KdV equation and  
it forms completely integrable Hamiltonian  system and this integral of motion corresponds to  
conservation of mass, momentum,  energy, etcetera    
In this section, I shall discuss about  two conservation of mass and energy  Now,  
we are going to the slide presentation  An  equation is said to be in conservative form  
if it can be written in the form which  is given in equation number seventeen  
that means if it can be written as del  T del t plus del X del x equals to zero   
Where capital T is called the density  and capital X is called the flux   
Assuming that T and X are integrable in the  interval minus infinity to plus infinity  
First we shall start with the dispersion  relation for water waves in an ocean  
and if we assume that capital X tends  to zero as mod x tends to infinity then  
integrating equation seventeen with respect to x  over the interval minus infinity to plus infinity  
we get d dt of integration minus infinity  to plus infinity T d x equals to value of  
dx equals to constant, thus  the density is conserved   
Now, we shall go back to the nonlinear KdV  equation which is given by del u del t minus six  
u del u del x plus del three u del x  cube equals to zero  This is the standard  
equation, standard form of the equation   Now, this equation can be written in the form  
del u del t plus del del t of minus three u  square plus del two u del x square equals to zero,  
where capital T is equal to small  u and capital X can be assumed as  
minus three u square plus del two u del x square   Now, if we integrate this equation with respect  
to x over the interval minus infinity to plus  infinity that means over the whole real axis   
So, the integral in the left hand side represent  the total mass of the system  Therefore, this  
integral of motion represent the conservation of  mass  Now, to get the another integral of motion  
we multiply the KdV equation that  means the first equation of this slide  
by u then we can write the terms in this way  as del del t of half u square plus del del  
x of minus two u cube plus u del u del x minus  half del u del x whole square equals to zero   
Now, if we again integrate this equation  with respect to x over the whole real line  
h zero is the depth of the ocean, omega is the  frequency of the wave and K is the wave number   
u square by two d x equals to constant, so  this represent the conservation of energy   
So, in this way one can prove the other integral  of motion or the other conservative properties  
of the KdV equation  Therefore, in module three of  chapter ten we have discussed about KdV equation   
The solution of nonlinear KdV equation is  a solitary wave which is a new phenomena  
So, from that equation we can find the  value of omega as function of k as g k  
In module one of the same chapter, we have  discussed about the nonlinear wave equation   
into tan hyperbolic k h zero to the power  half  Now, if we expand this function  
we will get omega is equivalent to c zero k into  one minus one by six k square h zero square,  
In many physical problems wave motion  with small dispersion exhibit such  
Now, the equation for free surface elevation  which is denoted by the variable eta  
plus sigma del cube eta del x cube equals  to zero  Where, sigma is defined as  
The equation two is known  as linearized KdV equation  
And we find that the nonlinearity and  the dispersion play a fundamental role  
Now, in this equation the phase velocity c p  is defined as omega by k and its value is c  
zero minus sigma k square  On the other hand, the  group velocity of the wave <?>train</?> which is  
denoted by c g and which is defined as d omega d  k is equals to c zero minus three sigma k square  
and these definitions are  given in equation three   
From equation three it can be noted that value  of the phase velocity is greater than value of  
we get c p equals to c zero and c g equals to c  zero that means the values of the phase velocity  
and the group velocity becomes constant and  this is the characteristic of a nondispersive  
to find the water wave motion  If we consider  nonlinear shallow water wave equation, then  
In eighteen hundred ninety-five, KdV  derived the nonlinear equation for  
long waves in a channel of depth h zero  and that nonlinear equation is given by  
del eta del t plus c zero into one plus three  by two eta by h zero del eta del x plus sigma  
del cube eta del x cube equals to zero  And  in this equation you can see nonlinear term  
which is here three eta c zero divided  by two h zero into del eta del x   
And the KdV equation I have already told  it arises in many physical problems like  
water waves of long wavelengths, plasma waves  and magneto hydrodynamic waves, etcetera   
Now, I want to find traveling wave solution  of nonlinear KdV equation which is written  
it leads to the breaking phenomena  if we don’t consider dispersion   
where X equals to x small x minus U t,  where U denotes the velocity of the wave  
and f is an arbitrary function and we  want to find the functional form of f    
Now, we substitute five into equation four  that means into the nonlinear KdV equation   
Now, since we are going to find the expression  for small f we integrate the previous relation   
And after integrating we get one by six h zero  square f double dash plus three by four f square  
plus one minus U by c zero f equals to  A, where A is the integrating constant   
Again this equation can be integrated, so for  that we multiply this equation both side by f dash  
But this breaking can be prevented if we can  incorporate the dispersion effect 
Now, let us think about the solitary wave solution  that means the quantity f, f dash, f double dash  
all goes to zero as mod X tends to infinity and  we think about that particular solution for which  
capital A equals to zero and capital B equals  to zero  So, under this condition equation six  
reduces to, so in equation six we put  A equals to zero and B equals to zero   
So, it reduces to one third h zero square f  dash square plus f square into f minus alpha  
equals to zero, where alpha is a constant  equals to two into U by c zero minus one   
this equals to three by h zero square f square  into alpha minus f, then we take the square  
root of f dash and then we integrate  So, we  obtain X minus X zero equals to h zero square by  
three square root into integration zero to f  d f by f into square root alpha minus f   
Therefore, the effect of nonlinearity and dispersion is  important to explain some physical phenomena   
Now, to find the value of this integral we  substitute f equals to alpha sec h square theta   
So, if you substitute that the value  of the integral can be obtained easily   
So, after integration it becomes X minus X zero  equals to four h zero square by three alpha  
to the power half into theta   
So, the value of f, so if we go back  to the previous slide what is f,  
to alpha into sech square this is the value of  theta which is written in the square bracket   
And the final solution that means the value of  eta, eta there is a relation between eta and f,  
this is the relation which is written in equation  number five, eta equals to h zero into f X   
So, expression for eta becomes eta zero into sech  hyperbolic square into three eta zero by four h  
With this purpose in module three of chapter ten  we shall discuss about the nonlinear KdV equation  
zero cube to the power half into x minus U t,  where eta zero is defined as alpha into h zero   
So, equation nine gives the solution  of the nonlinear KdV equation   
And this solution is called solitary wave solution  
So, if you brought the solution,  so this represent a single hump  
about X equals to zero, capital X equals  to zero and the amplitude becomes zero that  
means eta become zero as mod x tends to plus  infinity or minus infinity  And this humps goes  
in the right direction of small x axis with  velocity U and the value of U can be determined  
from this relation  In the middle of the slide you can see that  
alpha equals to two into U by c zero minus one   So, from this relation you can find the value of U  
where both the nonlinearity and the  dispersion effects are considered   
and this U gives the velocity of the soliton  So,  U equals to one plus alpha by two into c zero   
So, here you can get the value of the U, U equals  to c zero into one plus alpha by two and you know  
the value of alpha, so if you substitute you get U  equals to c zero one plus eta zero by two h zero   
It is to be noted that the velocity of the  wave depends on eta zero or in other words  
velocity is proportional to eta zero  Therefore, the taller soliton moves with  
more velocity than the shorter solution  or soliton and the width of the soliton  
which you can obtain from this,  so width of the soliton is  
three eta zero by four h cube to  the power minus half that means  
narrower width, therefore taller solitons moves  faster and are narrower than the shorter ones   
We have considered KdV equation because this  equation arises in many physical problems  
One of the major challenges in the field of complex system is the understanding of the
minus two U u minus two A  Since, it has two roots u one, u two, it can be factorized as
that means du by u minus u one into u minus u two equals to d Xi by two Nu 
we can integrate this  After integration it gives its value is equals
to one by u one minus u two, log of u one minus u divided by u minus u two  Therefore,
our solution u, therefore, our solution u can be obtained from the first line as, u
equals to u one plus u two e to the power Xi by two Nu u one minus u two, divided by
one plus e to the power Xi by two Nu into u one minus u two  So, it can be written as,
u two plus u one minus u two by one plus e to the power Xi by two Nu u one minus u two 
module is divided into three sections  In the first section we shall discuss about or
half of u one minus u two, tan hyperbolic Xi by two Nu u one minus u two  So, if you
this at Xi equals to minus infinity its value is u one  At Xi equals to plus infinity its
since u one is greater than u two  So, it will be monotonically decreasing function
of Xi 
And at the point Xi equals to zero, it takes the average value of u one and u two that
you can see from the figure, this  So, this is the traveling wave solution, this is the
solve the linear Burger equation  In the second section we shall try to find the traveling
is a decreasing function of Xi, and the shape of the wave form is significantly affected
by the diffusion coefficient Nu  If you see the solution, the shape of the curve depends
on the parameter Nu and this is the diffusion coefficient 
affected by the diffusion coefficient Nu  The diffusion process prevents the gradual
distortion of the wave profile, so it does not break  On the other hand, in the absence
of diffusion coefficient Nu, the wave profile suffers from gradual distortion and steepening 
in Burger's equation the nonlinearity and the diffusion term balance each other to make
a stable wave profile 
wave solution of Burger's equation  Finally, we shall find the exact solution of Burger's
In last two sections, we have discussed about the solution of linear Burger's equation,
and we also found the solution of nonlinear Burger's equation  But, it is to be mentioned
that it is possible to find exact solution of Burger's equation  In nineteen hundred
fifty, the scientist Cole and Hopf separately discovered a transformation using which the
nonlinear Burger's equation can be transformed to a linear diffusion equation  Now, I am
going to describe that transformation 
I have already discussed about the nonlinear Burger's equation, which is written in equation
number one  Now, I am going to solve that equation together with the initial condition
u at time t equals to zero equals to capital F x  Now, we write equation thirteen
equation using the Cole-Hopf transformation  Now, we are going to our slide show 
Nu del u del x equals to zero  This can be considered as the compatibility condition
for the existence of the function psi such that u can be written as del psi del x  And
the term within the bracket that means Mu, Nu del u del x minus half u square equals
to del psi del t, which are written in equation number fifteen 
psi, which is written in equation sixteen  Nu del two psi del x square minus half del
we are trying to transform the variable psi to another variable phi such that psi equals
to minus two Nu log phi  And we know that u equals to del psi del x, so in terms of
First, I am defining the Burger's equation  This is a simple model of turbulence and it can be
is called Cole-Hopf transformation 
Now, using this transformation we are trying to write equation sixteen in terms of the
two phi del x square  And you can see that this is a linear second order equation with
constant coefficient, so it’s very easy to solve, and this equation contains only
Together with the initial condition, let phi is described at time t equals to zero by the
function capital phi 
we are going to establish the relation between the function capital Phi and capital F, so,
derived from Navier-Stoke's equation  The Burger's equation in one dimension is
capital F x equals to u x at time t equals to zero  So, that equals to in terms of phi
if we integrate we can obtain the value of phi x zero equals to e to the power minus
one by two Nu integration capital F alpha d alpha, which is written in equation number nineteen 
Therefore, we have to find the solution of equation eighteen, together with the initial
condition nineteen  And it is very easy to find the solution of that initial value problem 
So, phi can be written as, phi equals to one divided by two square root Pi Nu t, integration
minus infinity to plus infinity capital phi, e to the power minus x minus Xi square by
written as del u del t plus u del u del x equals to Nu del two u del x square  One dimension
nineteen 
Now, substituting the value of capital Phi in equation twenty, we obtain the solution
in the form phi equals to one divided by two square root Pi Nu t, integration e to the
zero to Xi F alpha d alpha 
And del phi del x is equals to minus one divided by four Nu square root Pi Nu t, integration
x minus Xi by t, e to the power minus f by two Nu d Xi  Therefore, the exact solution
of phi or the expression for phi 
So, if you substitute that here in seventeen, you obtain the solution which is written in
means, I want to say that there is only one space variable which is denoted by small x 
equation number twenty three  So, here you have to substitute the value of phi and the
value of del phi del x, so that gives this solution  So, in this way we can obtain the
exact solution of nonlinear Burger's equation using Cole-Hopf transformation 
Thus, in module four of chapter ten, we have discussed about the Burger's equation, where
we have considered both nonlinear terms and the diffusion term  The role of nonlinearity
the wave profile  Therefore, the joint effect of nonlinearity and diffusion makes a stable
wave front  Now, we end this module 
Now, equation one, Nu represent the kinematic viscosity 
So, this is the dissipation term, and the nonlinear term is u del u del x  So, Burger's
equation is a balance between the time evolution, nonlinearity and the diffusion term 
equals to Nu del two u del x square, where t is the time variable and x runs from minus
infinity to plus infinity 
That means x can take in any value in the real axis  We have also the initial condition
another constant value u two, for x greater than zero  Now, we are going to solve equation
two, together with the initial condition which is given in equation three  Since, equation
This phenomena can be understood using the Navier-Stoke’s equation, which is a nonlinear partial differential
two is a linear equation with constant coefficient, we can apply any methods in particular one
can use Fourier transform method to find solution 
So, if we use Fourier transform method and use the initial condition three, it is easy
to find that solution can be written in the form, u equals to half of u one plus u two
minus half of u one minus u two into error function of x divided by two square root Nu
out the initial distribution like Nu t to the power minus half  And you can also verify that,
to plus infinity, u tends to the another constant value u two  Therefore, solution four satisfies
the initial conditions 
equation  In nineteen hundred thirty nine, the Dutch scientist Burger first simplified
we drop the diffusion term in one  So, if we go back to equation one that means if you
And we know the solution of first order wave equation, which I have discussed in module
one of this chapter, that this gives a shock wave solution  Or in other words, the nonlinearity
combines two opposite effects of nonlinearity and diffusion 
In the absence of diffusion, the resulting equation which I already told you this is
the shock wave solution does not exist and the shock wave solution is smooth out by the
the Navier-Stoke's equation dropping the pressure term  The term or the equation containing
term is linearized, that means the convictive term is u del u del x  Here, we are taking
the linear convictive term that means, we are taking the convictive term as alpha into
del u del x, where alpha is a constant 
So, we are going to solve equation five, again we are assuming a plane wave solution of this
equation  So, solution is assumed in the form u equals to a e to the power i kx minus omega
t, where imaginary part of omega equals to minus Nu k square, which is less than zero,
for Nu greater than zero 
the time derivative, nonlinear term and the diffusion term is known as Burger’s equation 
written in equation number seven  Now, this solution represent a diffusive wave with wave
number k and phase velocity c 
And if you see the amplitude of the wave, which is a times e to the power minus Nu k
wavelength becomes weaker with larger Nu 
Generally, in Burger's equation the external force field is not present  There are many
only the disturbances of long wavelength will survive  And I have already told that if Nu
is less than zero, solution seven tends to infinity, that means the solution becomes
So, to analyze that, to find that we assume a traveling wave solution in the form u x,
also given that the wave form with this property 
infinity, and it tends to another constant value u two, as Xi tends to plus infinity 
application of Burger's equation in applied mathematics, namely in gas dynamics, fluid
equation which is given in equation number one 
two u d Xi square equals to zero 
Now, this shows that there are two roots, if we see right hand side of this equation 
dynamics, traffic flow, nonlinear acoustics flow, et-cetera  Therefore, this module or
those constant values, du d Xi equals to zero  Therefore, the roots of the quadratic equation
u square minus two capital U small u minus two A equals to zero are small u one and small
u two  Solving this quadratic equation one can get the value of capital U as half of
u one plus u two, and the value of capital A which is product of two roots u one, u two 
A can be written in terms of products of two roots, so A equals to minus half u one u two 
So, from equation ten you can see that capital U that means the wave speed is the average
the module four of chapter ten is devoted to the study of Burger's equation  The entire
Now, I am going to start module five of chapter ten  This module is devoted to the study of
into two factor in f square  So,let capital F equals to alpha one minus alpha two f square
into beta one minus beta two f square 
Where, the constants alpha’s and beta’s are determined from the equations alpha equals
to minus alpha one beta two plus alpha two beta one  And capital A equals to alpha one
beta one, and gamma equals to minus two alpha two beta two  And we also assuming,
the equation sixteen as df dX equals to square root of alpha one minus alpha two f square
into beta one minus beta two f square 
Now, we separate the variables f and X, and obtain the value of capital X as integration
one to the power half into f as our new variable u  So, in terms of the new variable u, the
above integral becomes sigma x equals to integration zero to u du, by square root one minus u square
into one minus kappa square u square  Where, the new constant kappa and sigma are given
by which you can be seen in the last line of this slide 
Now, this integral is a famous integral, and it is an elliptic integral of first kind,
and we can find the value of this integral in terms of the elliptic function, Jacobian
function  So, the solution can be expressed in terms of Jacobian sin function,
we can obtain the value of f X as alpha one by alpha two to the power half into this is
the value of u  So, this is our required solution  In particular,
if the value of the integrating constant A equals to zero, so if we comeback
to the general solution, which is written in equation number sixteen  So, in particular
Sixteen gives square root alpha X equals to integration
zero to f, df by f into one minus gamma by two alpha f square to the power half 
Now, to compute this integral the natural substitution is gamma by two alpha to the power half, into
f equals to the sech h theta 
And substituting this, we can find the value of the integral exactly  So, f X becomes two
velocity U  So, if you observe the solution, so it represent the wave moves with constant
velocity U, and it is to be noted that the solitary wave exist only for unstable case
that means when gamma is greater than zero and one interesting feature is that the amplitude
and the velocity of the wave are independent 
whereas, in case of KdV equation, the speed depends on the amplitude of the
wave  So, this is the basic difference between the solution of KdV equation and the nonlinear
Schrodinger’s equation  Now, I want to derive nonlinear Schrodinger’s equation for deep
water waves problem, starting from the dispersion relation  The deep water waves problem,
So, from this relation we can find the value of omega zero dash, omega zero double dash,
and gamma, which is written in equation number twenty one  Now, substituting these values
in the amplitude equation, we can get the nonlinear Schrodinger’s equation for deep
think about that frame, which is moving with linear group velocity omega zero dash 
In that frame, equation twenty two reduces to the form, which is written in equation twenty three 
a nonlinear Schrodinger’s equation for deep water waves starting from the dispersion relation 
Now, we want to solve this equation  Mainly, they are interested to find the solitary wave solution
of the previous equation, that means of equation twenty three  So, for that we
assume the solution in the form amplitude a equals to g X into e to the power I gamma
square t, where capital X is small x minus omega zero dash t 
So, for that we multiply this equation by two dg dX, and then integrate and we obtain
equation twenty six  If we see the right hand side of this equation that means the value
g zero square minus g zero into g square minus m dash square g zero square  Where,
g zero to the power four m dash square is the integrating constant, and if we write
has a sharp peak around k zero, with a narrow wave number of width delta k equals
this expression as two factors  Then comparing the coefficients we can get the relation between
the parameters as two k zero to the power four equals to one, and we assuming m dash
square as one minus m square  So, it gives the value of g zero square as four gamma square
by omega zero k zero square into m square minus two  Now, if we go back to equation
twenty six, we take the square root of this equation 
So, that gives dg dX equals to square root of g zero square minus g square, into g square
minus m dash square into g zero square  Then we separate the variables g and x, and we
obtain the relation which is written in the third or the last line of this slide  Now,
the variables g and x are separated, so we can integrate it  So, after integration we
get g zero into X minus X zero equals to integration ds by one minus s square into s square minus
to k minus k zero  And this delta k is very small, and we are assuming that as order of
the value of the integral is dn g zero X minus X zero into m, where m is the modulus
Schrodinger’s equation for deep water wave problem  In nineteen hundred seventy two,
Zakharov and Shabat proved that nonlinear Schrodinger’s equation has infinite number
of conservation laws  These are in the form of integral with respect to x of the polynomials
in psi and its derivatives 
In this section I am going to establish two conservative laws, now we are going to the slide presentation 
To prove the conservation properties, we multiply the standard nonlinear
Schrodinger’s equation which is given by equation number fourteen by psi bar 
of psi x psi bar minus psi x bar psi equals to zero 
Schrodinger’s equation to find the another integral  We multiply equation fourteen again
by psi x bar and its complex conjugate by psi x, and then adding we get equation number
equation number fourteen 
Taylor series expansion as, omega at k equals to omega at k zero, plus
And the equation for its complex conjugate with respect to x, then we multiply the former
equation by psi bar  And the equation for complex conjugate by psi and then we add this
two equation, and this leads to the equation which is written in twenty nine  Now, subtracting
after simplification equals to d dx of psi bar psi xx, plus psi into psi bar xx plus
gamma d dx of mod psi to the power four 
d dt of integration psi bar psi x minus psi psi x bar dx equals to zero  That means the
quantity integration of psi psi x bar minus psi bar psi x dx remain constant, and let
that constant is c two  In the similar way we can prove that the quantity integration
Schrodinger’s equation  The discussion on linear and nonlinear Schrodinger’s equations
mod psi x square minus gamma by two mod psi to the power four dx also remain constant 
The derivation of this integral is available in our e-text 
So, we get three integral of motion c one, c two, c three and they are related to the
number of particles, momentum and the energy of the system governed by the nonlinear Schrodinger’s equation 
So, in this way we can obtain other integrals of this equation  Thus in module
five of chapter ten, we have discussed about nonlinear Schrodinger’s equation  In this
equation we have considered the effect of dispersion and nonlinearity  The joint effect
In this case the amplitude and the velocity are independent parameters  In contrast to
KdV equation, the amplitude and the velocity are not independent  Velocity depends on the
k zero plus dot dot 
amplitude of the wave  Thus, we end this module, at the same time we are ending the entire
course partial differential equation 
So, here omega zero is equal to omega at k zero, omega zero dash equals to omega dash
k zero  That is d omega dk at k equals to k zero, and omega zero double dash represent
d two omega dk square at k equals to k zero 
to the power i x minus omega zero dash t delta k, minus half i omega zero double dash delta
k square into t, into d of delta k 
that omega as the odd function of k, that means omega at minus k equals to minus of
omega k  If we see the expression for psi which is written in equation number four,
of x minus omega zero dash t and t 
power i k zero x minus omega zero t plus its complex conjugate  Where the modulated wave
mechanics, fluid dynamics, nonlinear optics, plasma dynamics, et-cetera  We shall first
the power i x minus omega zero dash t delta k, minus half i omega zero double dash delta
k square t into d of delta k 
Now, writing this expression in terms of Xi and tau, A becomes A equals to integration
Now, in this expression, in the expression six, k zero is considered as constant  Therefore,
A del tau variation of A with respect to the slow variable tau, can be computed from the
expression of A, which is given in equation number seven 
So, from seven we can easily find del A del tau equals to minus half i omega zero double
derive linear Schrodinger’s equation and nonlinear Schrodinger’s equation starting
del two A del Xi square equals to zero, which is given by equation number
Now, we want to derive the nonlinear Schrodinger’s equation starting from the dispersion relation 
from a dispersion relation  Then, we shall find the solitary wave solution of nonlinear
A square in the dispersion relation 
so the slow variation of amplitude can be written as this  So,in the previous, from
the previous expression or from equation ten, if we expand it in Taylor series expansion,
is nothing but the dispersion relation for the linear equation or the linear dispersion
relation, so, the first term becomes zero 
Schrodinger’s equation  Finally, we shall establish conservative laws for Schrodinger’s
that del del x star is of order epsilon, and del del t star is of order epsilon square 
A square A equals to zero 
twelve is known as nonlinear Schrodinger’s equation  If you observe this equation you
way we can derive nonlinear Schrodinger’s equation starting from the dispersion relation 
Now, we want to solve the nonlinear Schrodinger’s equation  So, to solve nonlinear Schrodinger’s
equation  Now, we are going to the first slide of this module 
equation, we take the standard form of the equation which is written in fourteen 
We are interested to find the solitary wave solution, that’s why we have taken the solution
in the form psi equals to f X e to the power i mX minus nt, where capital X equals to small
is written in the first line of this slide, where f double dash represents the derivative
of f with respect to capital X two times  And f dash is the derivative with respect
to capital X once 
To derive one dimensional linear Schrodinger’s equation, we consider the Fourier representation
becomes zero  So, we assume two m minus U equals to zero, and we take alpha as m square
to simply f  So, the above equation reduces to the form f double dash minus alpha f
to find the expression for small f 
So, for that purpose we multiply the equation with two f dash, and then we integrate  After
integration we get, f dash square equals to A plus alpha f square, minus gamma by two
f to the power four, where, capital A is the integrating constant  Let the expression in
the right hand side of equation sixteen is function of small f, and that function is
of the quasi-monochromatic plane wave solution in the form phi equals to integration capital
Hello friend 
the laws of motion 
He expressed the equation in terms of ordinary differential equation in seventeenth century 
of Euler, D’Alembert's, Lagrange and Laplace 
They used partial differential equation as a tool to describe the phenomena observed
in continuum mechanics 
The partial differential equation was mainly used then for modeling of many physical phenomena
observed in nature 
I have already told you in my introductory video that the entire course is divided into ten chapters 
algebraic geometry, topology, etcetera 
The detailed history of partial differential equation can be found in any book related
to history of mathematics 
Now, we are going to start the first slide of part one of module one 
Let me first define what is a partial differential equation?
An equation involving two or more independent variables and one dependent variable and it's
all order derivatives is called a partial differential equation 
Thus, the general form of a partial differential equation can be represented by equation number
define all other partial derivatives 
So, in the first day and in the first week we are going to start module one of chapter one 
Now, in equation number two, we have shown some partial differential equations so these
are the examples of partial differential equations 
Now, we want to define order of a partial differential equation, the highest order derivative
present in a partial differential equation is called the order of that differential equation 
If you observe equation number three, there are two equations, in the first equation the
highest order partial derivative is two and also in the second equation the highest order
derivative partial derivative is also two 
So, equation three gives the examples of second order partial differential equation 
Now, if we observe equation number four, the highest order partial derivatives present
in this equation is three 
Chapter one is divided into three modules, so today we are going to start the first module
So, this is an example of a third order partial differential equation 
Now, according to complexity in a partial differential equation we can categorize a
partial differential equation into four categories 
The simplest one is the linear partial differential equation 
A partial differential equation is said to be linear if it is linear in the unknown function
and all its derivatives 
One example of a linear differential equation is given in equation number five 
So, if you see the coefficients of the derivatives in this equation they are only function of
x and y, so this is a linear differential equation 
Now, we shall define a quasi linear differential equation 
and also the module one is divided into two parts 
A partial differential equation is said to be quasi linear if it is linear in the highest
order derivative of the unknown function 
The coefficient of highest order term may be function of independent variables, dependent variables
and the lower order derivatives 
One example of quasi linear equation is the KdV equation which is written in equation
number six and this is a third order quasi linear differential equation and this equation
appears in plasma physics and in nonlinear dynamics 
Now, we shall define a semi-linear partial differential equation 
A partial differential equation is said to be semi-linear if it is linear in the highest
order derivative of the unknown function, but there is a difference between a quasi
So, first we will start part one of module one of chapter one 
linear and semi-linear differential equation, in case of a semi-linear differential equation
the coefficients of higher order derivative are only function of independent variables 
But in contrast, in case of quasi linear equation the coefficient of highest order derivatives
may be function of dependent variables and the partial derivatives of lower order 
One example of semi-linear equation is written in equation number seven and another example
is also given in equation number eight, where del square is the Laplacian and which is defined
as del two del x square del two del y square del two del z square 
The equation number six appears in differential geometry 
And the most complicated equation which does not belong to the earlier categories, that
means the equation which is neither linear nor quasi linear or nor semi-linear that equation
In this part, I shall give definition of partial differential equation and I shall also classify
is called a nonlinear equation 
A nonlinear equation is very complex and very difficult to solve 
This is one example of non-linear equation 
So, in this part you have learned the definition of partial differential equation and its classification 
So, there are four types of partial differential equation according to the presence of non-linearity,
but it is to be noted that though the linear PDE is the simplest one it is very difficult
to solve a linear problem 
In some few cases, in some particular cases we can solve a linear differential equation
and in some few cases we can solve semi linear equations but finding analytical solution
that equation according to the non-linearity present in that equation 
to find solution 
You can learn this method in the course of numerical analysis 
In this way we end this part 
So, before going to the main slide, let me say a few words about the history of partial
differential equation 
﻿Hi friend  Today I am going to start part two  of module one  In part one, we have defined  
at the end of module one you will get some problem  for self-assessment  So, in this way we end module  
where the partial differential appears  together with some supplementary condition   
Consider a thin homogeneous perfectly flexible  string which is under uniform tension along  
x axis in its equilibrium position and the end  of the string are fixed at x equals to zero  
and x equals to L  Now, the string is pulled  aside a short distance and then released    
So, the string will now under free  vibration so the motion of the string  
can be written by the differential equation  del two u del t square equals to c square  
del two u del x square and this  equation is known as wave equation and  
there are some conditions those are to be  maintained to solve this problem, those are  
initial conditions   So, initial conditions  
which is the condition which is given at time  t equals to zero, so u x at zero equals to f x  
partial differential equation, we have also  classified those equation  But, to describe  
that means we are assuming the position of  the string or being some function f x and the  
velocity of the string is given by the function  g x and we also have the boundary conditions  
u zero t equals to zero and u L t equals to  zero since the two end of the string are fixed   
So, the initial conditions and the boundary  conditions are the supplementary conditions,  
so we have to solve the partial differential  equation together with these two conditions    
Now, if the, if the problem is in unbounded medium  then we cannot define any boundary conditions,  
then the equation is to be solved  together with the initial condition  
so that type of problems are called  initial value problem or Cauchy problem   
So, this is one example of initial  value problem, this is heat equation,  
one dimensional heat equation and the supplemented  condition is given by u x zero equals to f x  So,  
some natural phenomena we need to solve a partial  differential equation of some physical quantity  
this is the initial temperature field so according  to the supplementary condition we can divide  
a problem or a mathematical problem into  some categories like initial value problem,  
boundary value problem or mixed  initial boundary value problem    
Before solving a partial differential equation  we have to think about the solvability of the  
partial differential equation  A mathematical  problem is said to be well-posed if it satisfies  
the following three conditions  The first  one is the existence, which says that there  
is at least one solution of the problem and  the second one is the uniqueness which says  
that there is at most one solution and the third  important criteria is the continuity, that is the  
solution depends continuously on the data   So, a mathematical problem is said to be  
well-posed if it satisfies all three conditions   So, it is possible to find a solution of  
together with some auxiliary conditions   There are two types of auxiliary conditions,  
a well-posed problem  A problem which is not  well-posed that means which does not satisfies  
any of the above three conditions is called an  ill-posed problem  An ill-posed problem cannot be  
solved mathematically   Now, I want to illustrate  
the concept of existence, uniqueness  and continuity using some examples   
Let us first consider the example ux square  plus uy square equals to one, this is given  
differential equation and we have to solve this  equation using the auxiliary condition uy is  
conditions which do not satisfy the given equation  may lead to the no solution of that problem   
So this is the example, if you see the  boundary condition uy is greater than zero,  
this condition will not satisfy the equation, you  will not get any real solution of this problem,  
one is called initial condition and the  other one is called boundary condition    
so there does not exist any  solution of this problem    
Now, to illustrate the idea of uniqueness  we have considered the motion of transfers  
motion of a string which is described by the first  order wave equation which is given in the second  
example del two u del t square is equal  to c square del two u del x square   
And the string is clamped at the two points  at x equals to zero and x equals to l,  
so that is described by the boundary condition  u zero t equals to zero u Lt equals to zero    
And this is to be solved together with the Cauchy  condition u x zero equals to f x, so these gives  
sufficient to find the unique solution, that  means what will be the transfer speed of the  
string that is not described here  So, for  different values of the transfer speed one  
If the physical quantity is prescribed at some  particular time, then those type of conditions  
can get different answer, so for this example,  uniqueness of the solution is not valid    
Now, I am going to discuss the continuity or  the stability of the solution  So, for the  
for this case we are considering the same  equation, one dimensional wave equation  
and the initial conditions is given by u x zero  equals to u cap and u t x zero is equal to v cap   
Let the solution of the first set  of equation is u  Now, we deviate,  
now deviate the initial condition in a small  amount, so we are trying to find the solution  
of the equation but the initial condition is  slightly different from the original one    
So, you can see that u cap is replaced  by u cap is replaced by u one cap  
and v cap is replaced by v one cap  but these u one cap and v one cap  
these two functions are very near to the function  u cap, v cap that means in mathematical sense  
are called initial conditions, on the other  hand if that physical quantity is described  
we can define their norm u cap minus u one cap  is less than epsilon and v cap minus v one cap  
is less than epsilon where epsilon is greater  than zero  So an epsilon is some suitably chosen  
constant and this is valid for zero less  than equals to x less than equals to L   
Now, we can say that this equation is stable,  this problem is stable if the solution of the  
first set of equation and the solution of the  second set of equations are differ by very small  
amount  So in mathematical sense we can say that  if u one is the solution of the corresponding  
change initial condition and u is  the solution of the original problem,  
then if this condition is hold that means norm  of u minus u one is less than delta where delta  
is greater than zero some suitable constant  and delta depends on the constant epsilon    
So, if this condition is hold we can say that  the continuity condition also hold    
at some particular point in space, then those type  of conditions are known as boundary conditions   
So, we have learned that if these three  conditions existence, uniqueness and continuity  
condition holds we can say that the problem is  well-posed and a well-posed problem is solvable,  
we can find solution of a well-posed problem but  the solution of ill-posed problem does not exist   
So, this is the example of one ill-posed problem   This was first observed by French mathematician  
Hadamard so he tried to solve the Laplace equation  which is given by uxx plus cyy equals to zero   
In the half plane x greater than zero, together  with the condition u at zero y equals to zero  
and the derivative of u at x equals to  zero is e to the power minus root n,  
n sine ny  This equation has, it can be proved  that this equation has a unique solution and that  
solution is given by un x, y is equal to e to the  power minus root n e to the power nx sine ny    
So, this solution will satisfy both the  equation and the boundary conditions  
In this video we are going to explain  those auxiliary conditions    
but it is to be noted that if n is very large  then un x, y as well the derivative of u and  
x tends to zero for y is equal to zero but un  x, y takes a large value when y is not equal  
to zero so there is a discontinuity in the  line y is equal to zero  So, when y is equal  
to zero the solution is zero and when y is not  equals to zero solution increases infinitely  
so continuity condition does not holds here  So,  this is one example of ill-posed problem    
Therefore in this part you have learned about  different auxiliary conditions  You also got  
introduced with the well-posed problem  Therefore,  in a nutshell we can say that in module one  
the knowledge of surfaces and curves are required   So, that part is not discussed in this video    
If you wish you can go through the study material  attached with this video  Apart from that  
Now, we shall take one example, so  this is example of a physical system  
﻿This is module two of chapter one, this module  is devoted to the solution of Simultaneous  
equation we will get three values of rho and  let us suppose that those three roots are  
rho one, rho two and rho three, therefore in  the previous expression each of this quantity  
can be written in this form that means  the given equation are proportional to  
this value, that means here we are taking the  value rho as rho one and here we are taking  
the value rho as rho two and here we are taking  the value rho of rho three and the corresponding  
values of lambda mu and nu are considered  and these three expressions are same   
get an equation of this form and the third, there  will be a third relation corresponding to rho  
equals to rho three and lambda three, mu three,  nu three so equating the first one and third one  
we will get a equation of a surface  like this  Thus, we get two integrals  
of the given equation  So, in this way using  method two we can solve the given equation    
Now, we are going to describe method  three which is most simplest, in this case  
we are assuming that one of the variable  say z is absent from one equation of the  
set that means in the equation dx by P equals  to dy by Q equals to dz by R in this equation,  
z is absent so dy dx is Q by P but there is no  any z, so we can solve it, this is a first-order  
differential equation, so we can solve it  easily and plate that solution is f xy c one  
equals to zero  Now, from this expression  eliminating x or writing y as function  
of x and substituting that in the original  equation we can get the other integral    
Now, we will explain that method taking this  example, we have to find the integral of this  
equation so, if you see this equation  you can see that if we take the second  
and third one you can eliminate the function  x from these two equation so if we eliminate x  
from the second and third equation that will give  equation dy dz equals to y by z or in other words  
we can find the solution as y is equal to c one  z, where c one is the integrating constant    
Now, using this form of y if we substitute in  the first equation the functional form of y  
or the value of y if you substitute here, we  will get a relation like this where c one is  
arbitrary constant, now this equation first and  third equation this will give a equation which  
is solvable and integrating this equation we  will get another integral which is written here  
x square plus y square plus z square equals to  c two z, therefore there are two integral of  
that given equation one is y is equal to c  one z and the other one is x square plus y  
square plus z square equals to c two z  So, in  this way we can solve the simultaneous equation  
ways, this is one way and this is another way   Now, before solving a simultaneous equation  
using method three   Now, we shall discuss  
how the method of solving simultaneous  equation can be applied in geometrical problem   
In the geometrical problem we shall show that  how to find orthogonal trajectories of a system  
of orthogonal curves   Now, we shall discuss how  
to find orthogonal trajectories of a  system of curves on a given surface   
Suppose the equation of a surface is given by  equation number seven, F x, y, z equals to zero  
and there is a system of curves on this surface  and let the equation of the curve is given by  
together with equation seven and equation eight   Since, in equation eight there is one parameter C,  
so seven and eight together represent a system  of curves where for different values of C we  
we have to know about the existence  and uniqueness theorem  It tells about  
For example, let us take a  cone, the equation of this cone  
is given by x square plus y square  equals to z square tan square alpha  Now,  
if we cut this plane by the plane z  equals to C then different values of C  
we will get a curve for this case this is a  system of circles  So, we are interested to find  
a system of curves which are perpendicular  to all these circles  So for this case,  
these are they are nothing but the generator  of this cone  Now, how to find mathematically?  
Orthogonal trajectories of a system of  curves is described in the next slide    
Now, we know that dx, dy, dz represent  the tangential direction to a given curve  
and the equation of the curve we already know is  represented by equation seven and equation eight   
whether a system of equations or simultaneous  equation will have a solution or not 
plus del F del y dy plus del F del z dz  equals to zero and the similar equation for G   
Now, if we solve these two equation we will get  a simultaneous equation like this where P, Q,  
R they are function of del F, del x del F del  y del F del z and del G del x del G del y del  
G del z and these expressions are written here   So, these are the Jacobians of the function F  
the curve through x, y, z of the orthogonal system  has the tangential direction dx dash, dy dash,  
dz dash, then it will satisfy the equation del  F del x dx dash plus del F del y dy dash plus  
del F del z dz dash equals to zero since the  orthogonal systems also lies on the surface F  
Suppose, the function f which is function of x, y, z  and the function g be defined and continuous  
and it is perpendicular to the original curve  that means dx dx dash dy dy dash dz dz dash  
must be equals to zero and dx, dy, dz  they are proportional to P, Q, R    
So, we arrive to the equation number eleven   Now, we have to solve for dx dash, dy dash,  
dz dash and these dx dash, dy dash, dz  dash are given by equation ten and eleven  
and solving ten and eleven we can write  the simultaneous equation in this form,  
where expressions for P dash, Q dash, R dash  are written in equation number thirteen   
Now, this equation we have to find, we  have to solve the equation number twelve  
that will give the system of  orthogonal trajectories    
Now, we shall take one example to  visualize the thing more clearly   
Suppose, we have a surface x square plus y  square plus two fyz plus d equals to zero and the  
in some region mod x minus a less than k,  mod y minus b less than l and mod z minus c  
orthogonal, the system of curves are represented  by this surface and the intersection of this  
surface with the xy plane that means the equation  of the system of curves is represented by z equals  
to k and this surface that means x square plus y  square plus two fyz plus d equals to zero  Now,  
satisfy the equation x dx plus y plus fzdy plus fy  dz equals to zero and also dz equals to zero    
Now, solving these two equations we will get  this relation, this is a simultaneous equation  
in three variables and now we want to find a  direction which is orthogonal to this direction  
so that direction, if that direction is dx, dy,  dz so this will satisfy this equation since the  
orthogonal trajectories will must lie on the  given surface so this equation will be satisfied  
and the orthogonal trajectories is perpendicular  to the given system of curves so this equation  
will be satisfied  So, if we solve these two  equations then that will give the differential  
equation for the orthogonal trajectories   Now, we solve the simultaneous equation using the  
method, different methods which we have described  already  We will get the solution like this,  
of the surface which is written here  So, the  system of orthogonal trajectories is given by  
this equation and the integral of this curve that  means this equation, fyz plus d equals to cx   
Thus, the solution of the given equation is  given by fyz plus d equals to cx which is  
integral of this equation and the  equation of the surface x square plus  
y square plus two fyz plus d equals to zero   Thus in brief we learned how to find solution of a  
simultaneous equation of first order first degree,  we have learned three different methods to solve  
which are written in equation number two   The first one is the Lipschitz condition to the  
those equations and we have also learned how  to find orthogonal trajectories of a system  
function f with respect to the variable y and z  and the second one is the Lipschitz condition to  
Differential Equation of First-Order and First  Degree  These type of equations has applications  
the function g with respect to the variable y and  z  So, if these two conditions are satisfied and  
here this Ai and Bi’s are some finite constant   So, if these Lipschitz condition is satisfied  
then the given system of equations, that means  the equation dy dx equals to f x, y, z or dz  
dx equals to g x, y, z has some solution which  is continuous and having continuous derivatives  
in a suitable interval mod  of x minus a less than h  
So, this is an important theorem regarding the  existence of a simultaneous differential equation   
So, if these conditions are satisfied then only  simultaneous equation has some solutions   
Now, we shall discuss different methods for  finding solution of simultaneous equation   
Now, if we go back to the representation  one of the simultaneous equation,  
in mathematical physics and in this module  we shall solve or rather we will discuss  
if you take the first two equation  dx by P equals to dy by Q,  
suppose this equation is solvable then  we will get a relation of this form  
u one x, y, z equals to c one   Now, if you take the second and third equation  
that means dy by Q equals to dz by  R then we will get another relation  
you two x, y, z equals to c two and we have  already read that a function u one x, y, z equals  
to c one represent equation of a surface and u  two x, y, z equals to c two represent equation  
of another surface but these two equations  together represent equation of a curve therefore,  
equation four represent a system of curve with two  parameters and those two parameters are c one and  
c two  So, here we learn that the simultaneous  equation in three variables, the general  
solution of this type of equation is a system  of curves with two arbitrary parameters    
different methods for solving the simultaneous  equations and later on we shall discuss how to use  
Now, we are going to discuss how to find the  integral curves, curve of a given equation   
we find t one that we want to describe? Now, any  tangential direction through the point x, y, z to  
the above surface will satisfy the relation du one  equals to, this is the total derivative of u one,  
equals to zero, del u one del x dx plus del u  one dy dy del u one del z dz equals to zero and  
as the function P dash and del u one del y as  the function Q dash and del u one del z as the  
function R dash, then these equation becomes PP  dash plus QQ dash plus RR dash equals to zero    
So, our aim is to find P dash, Q dash, R dash such  that the equation five holds and at the same time  
the concept of solving simultaneous differential  equation to solve geometrical problem    
this du one that means P dash  dx plus Q dash dy plus R dash dz  
must be an exact differential, therefore,  our aim is to find P dash, Q dash,  
R dash which satisfy this equation  and this is an exact differential   
Now, we shall take one example  then it will be more clear   
Suppose we have to find integral  curves of this simultaneous equation   
zero and these P dash, Q dash, R dash are such  that P dash dx and Q dash dy plus R dash dz  
this must be an exact differential   So, with this choice of P dash, Q dash,  
R dash it becomes exact differential  and that is written here  So, for this  
In this module, we shall mainly discuss  how to solve a simultaneous equations in  
equation we get one integral curve u one  equals to x plus y into z plus one    
Now, to find the general solution of this  equation we need two integral curves, so  
we again choose three functions P double  dash, Q double dash, R double dash  
in this way and we also see that it satisfies  this relation PP double dash, QQ double dash plus  
RR double dash equals to zero not only that it  satisfies also this quantity with this choice of P  
dash, Q dash, R dash, this quantity becomes exact  differential so our next, the second integral  
is u two equals to x minus y into z minus c   Therefore, the general solution of the system,  
given system of equations can be written in this  form so this is one integral and this is another  
integral and these two equations represent  equation of a curve with two parameters   
Now, we shall describe another method  to find integral, in the previous method  
three variables, the general representation of  a simultaneous equation in three variables is  
we have chosen P dash, Q dash, R dash, P  double dash, Q double dash, R double dash  
arbitrary but in other words we can say that  with using trial and error method we found  
the expressions for P dash, Q dash, R dash and  P double dash, Q double dash, R double dash,  
but if we want to find the values, the  expressions for these variables mathematically,  
we have some derivation  Now this is our given  equation  Now, this is equals to P double dash  
dash, Q dash, R dash in such a way that it becomes  total differential or exact differential    
So, let this is dw dash and this is dw double  dash, so if we equate these two quantity,  
then we will get a relation between the two  integral w dash equals to w double dash plus c   
So, using this method we can find the integral  curves  Now, let us take this example   
Using method two you want to find integral  curves of this equation  So, this is our P,  
this is our Q and this is our z and in this  equation alpha, beta, gamma are constants  Now,  
now we multiply the numerator with lambda,  
d lambda into dx, we compute this mu  into dy, mu into dz divided by this,  
now we want to find the values of lambda  mu nu such that each of the expression    
Now, we shall take one example to explain  the method two, we have to find integral  
curves of this equation  In this equation alpha,  beta, gamma are constants  Now in method two,  
we try to write the equation in this form lambda  dx plus mu dy mu dz divided by lambda into y plus  
we do not know the values of lambda mu nu and we  want this expression is to be exact differential  
that means, this expression can be written in  the form one by rho lambda dx plus mu dy plus  
nu dz divided by lambda x plus mu y plus nu z   Now, these two equations, the previous expression  
and this expression will be equal  or equivalent if and only if,  
in the numerator these two expressions are same  but in the denominator to make the equivalent  
rho that means beta mu equals plus  nu equals to lambda rho and similarly  
equating the coefficients of y from the  denominator we will get other two equations    
Now, to find the nonzero values of  lambda mu nu we have the condition,  
the determinant of this matrix must be equals to  zero, so that will give a cubic equation in rho  
in terms where the coefficients are written in  terms of alpha, beta, gamma and solving this  
﻿This is module three of chapter one   In this module we are going to discuss  
In last section we have discussed about the  solvability of a Pfaffian differential equation  
in three variables  That means if a  differential equation is given we can  
check whether that equation is solvable or not  using the necessary and sufficient condition  
of solvability  But, how to find the integral  of that differential equation is not discussed   
So, right now we are going to discuss  different methods for solving a Pfaffian  
differential equation in three variables  Now, we are going to discuss different methods  
for solving a Pfaffian differential equation  in three variables  Before discussing  
different methods we are assuming the condition of  integrability is satisfied for all the equations   
The method one is by inspection  So, in this  method we have to find the integral by inspection   
So, let us take one example  So, in this  example we need to solve the equation  
with two variables and Pfaffian differential  equation with more than two variables    
which is given here, so first of all we check  the integrability condition of this equation   
so x dot curl x become zero, therefore,  the given equation is integrable  Now,  
if we look at the equation then it can be written  in this form  Total differential of some function  
d of z plus xyz plus x plus dy by y minus  d of y plus z by y plus z equals to zero   
So, after integrating we get the  integral of the given equation like this,  
y into z plus x equals to c into y plus  z where c is the arbitrary constant   
Now, we shall discuss method two which is  separation of variables so this is a special case  
this form it is easy to find the integral, after  integrating the equation we can get the integral  
So, we shall discuss the equation taking two  variables separately and later on we shall  
plus two zx dy minus three xy dz equals  to zero  So, first of all we have to check  
whether this equation is integrable or not  So, if we use the integrability condition  
that means x dot curl x it becomes zero for this  given equation and if we look at this equation  
the function Px, the coefficient of dx, the  coefficient of dy and coefficient of dz can  
be separable  If the equation is divided by x, y  and z, so dividing the given equation by x, y and  
z it becomes dx by x, two dy by y, minus three  dz by z equals to zero  So, after integrating  
we get an integral xy square equals to cz  cube where c is the integrating constant    
This is method three  In method three only  one variable is separable, so for this case  
without any loss of generality we assume that  the coefficient of dx is only function of x and  
discuss a Pfaffian differential  equation taking three variables   
Q and R are function of y and z only  So, for  this case to become integrable this system,  
the integrability condition should be satisfied   So, if we use the integrability condition  
Px dx plus d psi equals to zero  So, after integrating we can get the integral  
easily, so this is the solution or primitive  of the given equation  To illustrate  
that we are taking one example, y square minus  z square, x square minus one dx minus two zx dy  
plus two xydz equals to zero  First of all we  have to check the integrability of this equation,  
so for that we computed this x dot  curl x this is zero, for this example,  
therefore the given equation is integrable   And the given equation can be written  
in the form x minus one by xdx minus two  dyz by y by z whole square minus one   
So, after integrating we can find the  integral very easily and this is the integral  
of the given equation where  c is an arbitrary constant   
Now, this is method four  In this method  four we are assuming that the function  
PQR are homogenous function of x, y and  z and they are of same degree n    
So, for a homogenous function if we substitute  this y is equal to u into x and z equals to  
v into x, the equation becomes this and we  can say that the variable x become separable  
an integral, therefore it is possible  to find the integral for this case   
We shall take one example to illustrate  the idea of homogenous equation   
q x y dy equals to zero and this equation can  be written in the form dy dx equals to f x y  
So, this is a homogenous equation in x, y, z and they are of, it is of degree three   
and x dot curl x after simplification is zero   Hence, the given equation satisfies the  
integrability condition  Therefore, we can  look for an integral of the given equation   
Now, if we look at the expression for P,  Q and R, these are functions of x, y, z  
and of degree three  Not only  function, they are homogenous function  
of degree three  So, the substitution we need  to make y is equal to ux and z equals to vx   
So, if you substitute this that means now we are  changing the equation from x, y, z to x, u, v,  
where f x y equals to minus p by q   Now, the equation three is defined that means the  
is also integrable and after integrating we get  the integral y cube plus z x square equals to cx   
And this is the fifth method, method of  reduction  In this method we assume that one of  
it has the integral phi, phi xy equals to c  And here c is independent of x and y but c may  
to clear that idea we are taking one example,  this is the example  X y square minus a square dx  
plus y x square minus z square dy minus z  y square minus a square dz equals to zero   
First we take y as a constant, so if you take y as  a constant then the term this term dy become zero,  
so the equation becomes x y square minus a  square dx minus z y square minus s square dz  
function f is defined if a P and Q are defined   Therefore, the equation dy dx equals to f x y  
equals to zero or in other words x  dx minus z dz equals to zero    
And this equation is integrable, we can find  easily the integral of this equation as x  
square minus z square so in this case phi  xz is x square minus z square equals to c,  
but you have to remember that this c is  independent of x and z but it may depend on y,  
so phi xz is equal to c, c is function of y   So, if you take the differential of phi  
then it will be like this, and if we  compare this with the given equation  
equals to zero  And it is very easy to  solve, so after integrating we will get  
relation like this c into y square minus a  square is equal to c dash and we also have  
x square minus z square equals to c   So, if we substitute the value of c here,  
can be defined  In particular if P and Q  are single valued function then f is also  
x square minus z square so this equals  to c dash by y square minus a square,  
or in other words the integral can be written in  this form, x square minus z square into y square minus a  
square equals to c dash  So, this is the required  integral or solution of the given equation   
And the last method is the method of  auxiliary equation  In this equation we  
try to find or we try to write an equation,  auxiliary equation to find the solution of the  
Pfaffian differential equation   So, if this is our given equation  
and if we assume this is integrable  then it should satisfy the condition  
grad dot curl x equals to zero and  this condition leads to the equation  
y minus del Q del x equals to zero   Now, X dot dr equals to zero gives the  
a single valued function  So, for that case  the equation three can be solved easily and  
equation Pdx plus Qdy plus Rdz equals to  zero  So, if we compare these two equations  
del P del y minus del Q del x respectively  And  this equation is called auxiliary equation    
So, in this procedure from a Pfaffian differential  equation we are constructing an auxiliary equation  
which is a simultaneous equation  Now, using  the methods of solving a simultaneous equation  
we shall try to find the integral of  the Pfaffian differential equation    
z plus x square dy minus xy in to x plus y dz  equals to zero  So, first of all we have to verify  
the condition of integrability of this equation  so x is this and grad of x is this, so x dot  
curl x is equal to zero for this equation  So, it implies that this equation is  
if we take the initial condition as y is  equal to y zero at x equals to x zero,  
about Pfaffian differential equation  First  we shall define Pfaffian differential equation  
integrable, so it is possible to find the integral  surface of the given equation  Now, the auxiliary  
equation becomes this, now this is a simultaneous  equation and we have already read how to find  
solution of a simultaneous equation in earlier  module  So, in this equation we can solve taking  
this three equation in this way, this is the  one integral, x plus y into z equals to constant  
and x y minus z equals to constant, this is the  another integral of this simultaneous equation,  
therefore these two equation together  implies the equation solution of this  
equation, simultaneous equation   So, this is the solution of the given Pfaffian  
differential equation  In module three of chapter  one, we learned Pfaffian differential equation,  
we have established the necessary and sufficient  condition for solvability for a Pfaffian  
differential equation and we have also discussed  six different methods for solving a Pfaffian  
then the solution of three is a curve which  passes through the point x zero y zero   
differential equation in three variables  In this  way we end this module and chapter one 
So, the general solution of the equation three can  be considered as a one parameter family of curves  
in xy plane which is given by phi x y  equals to c, where c is a constant    
Now, I shall discuss how to find the integral  of the Pfaffian differential equation with two variables   
Let, phi x y equals to c is  an integral or solution of the equation three 
Then, the P expression Pdx  plus Qdy can be written as d of phi   
Now, if we expand d of phi we will get del phi  del x dx plus del phi del y dy equals to zero   
So, if we compare this equation with  Pdx plus Qdy, we will get the relation  
one by P del phi del x equals to one by Q del phi  del y equals to mu, which is function of x and y   
And this function mu is called an integrating  factor of the differential equation   
and then we shall establish the necessary and  sufficient condition for solvability of a Pfaffian  
mu xy so that the expression mu Pdx plus  Qdy equals to an exact differential d phi   
And we can establish that for two variables  
if Pfaffian differential equation  always possesses an integrating factor   
Now, we are going to discuss about a Pfaffian  differential equation in three variables   
Equation five is a general form of a Pfaffian  differential equation in three variables   
and dr is equals to dx, dy, dz   There is a lemma, a necessary and sufficient  
condition for the existence of a relation of the  form F u, v equals to zero between two functions  
differential equation and lastly we shall discuss  various methods to solve these type of equations   
This lemma can be proved very easily if anyone  is interested to see the proof of this lemma,  
they can go through the study material of  this lecture  Now, there is another lemma,  
let x be a vector function of x, y, z  and mu is a function of x, y, z then  
mu x dot curl of mu x equals to zero if and  only if x dot curl of x equals to zero 
And this lemma is also can be proved very easily  And this proof is given also in study material   
And these two lemmas are very important to prove  the theorem which is stated here and this theorem  
is very important in the sense that it says  about the necessary and sufficient condition  
for the Pfaffian differential equation to be  integrable  So, a Pfaffian differential equation  
x dot dr equals to zero if this condition is  satisfied, x dot curl of x equals to zero   
Now, we are going to prove this theorem   We shall first prove the necessary part of  
So, let us go to the first slide  of module three of chapter one   
this theorem, that means we are first assuming  that the Pfaffian differential equation x dot dr  
plus del phi del z dz equals to zero   And if we compare this equation with the given  
equation we will get a relation between PQR and  the function phi  And this is the relation among  
them mu p equals to del phi del dx, mu q equals  to del phi del y and mu R equals to del phi del z   
So, mu x can be written as gradient of the  function phi  Now, if we take curl of mu x  
that gives zero, therefore mu x dot, curl  of mu x equals to zero  Now, if we recall  
lemma two, it says that if mu x  dot curl mu x equals to zero, it  
First of all I am defining Pfaffian  differential equation in this first slide   
implies x dot curl of x equals to zero  So, using that lemma we can conclude  
that x dot curl x equals to zero  Therefore,  the necessary part of this theorem is proved   
curl x equals to zero and we have to proof  that x dot dr equals to zero is integrable    
So, to prove that first we assume that z is a  constant, then the given differential equation  
a Pfaffian differential equation with two  variable always possesses an integrating factor,  
therefore, there exists an integrating factor mu  such that this expression Pdx plus Qdx will become  
total differential of some function  So, let mu is our integrating factor   
So, if we multiply this equation by mu then we  can write the equation in this form where mu p  
In equation one sum of Fi dxi is  called the Pfaffian differential  
equals to del phi del x mu q equals to del phi  del y and the equation becomes in this form   
Now, this part del phi del x dx, now think z is  not a constant, so if we take z as a variable  
then this part del phi del x dx plus del phi del  y dy plus del phi del z dz can be written as d of  
phi and the rest part is written in this form, psi  into dz equals to zero where psi is the function,  
mu r minus del phi dz  Now, mu into x it becomes  
del phi del x del phi del y del phi del z  plus psi, so it can be written in this form,  
that means del phi del x del phi  del y del phi del z plus psi dot  
del psi del y minus del psi del x zero, it becomes  Jacobian of phi and psi with respect to x and y   
and the equation sum of Fi dxi equals to zero  is called a Pfaffian differential equation    
we can write that mu x dot  curl of mu x equals to zero   
Therefore, this Jacobian del phi psi, del xy  equals to zero  Again if we use lemma one,  
phi and z  Therefore the equation eight becomes d  phi dx plus psi phi z equals to zero  So, we have  
to remember that this psi is now only function of  phi and z  Again this is a Pfaffian differential  
phi, capital phi phi z equals to c  Now, replacing phi by its expression in terms of  
of the given differential equation x dot dr  equals to zero or in other words we can say  
that the Pfaffian differential equation  x dot dr equals to zero is integrable   
Here, Fi is function of n  variables x one, x two and x n   
Therefore, assuming the condition x dot curl of x  equals to zero we arrive to the conclusion that x  
Now, we want to apply this theorem to  prove the solvability of a given Pfaffian  
differential equation  The equation is given  in this form, yz plus z square dx minus zx dy  
plus xy dz equals to zero  We have to  prove that this equation is integrable   
x dot curl of x if becomes after  simplification zero  Hence the condition  
x dot curl x equals to zero is satisfied  So, using the necessary and sufficient condition  
of the previous theorem we can say that the  given differential equation is integrable   
There is a fundamental difference  between a Pfaffian differential equation  
﻿Now, we are going to start chapter two  This  chapter is devoted to first-order partial  
xyz pq equals to zero  From the given differential  equation one can eliminate p and q from the  
equation capital F equals to zero del f del p  equals to zero and del f del q equals to zero   
And that equation is the singular solution  of the given differential equation    
Now, let us take one example, z square into  p square plus q square plus one equals to c  
square where c is a constant and we have to prove  that this is x minus a whole square plus y minus b  
whole square plus z square equals to c square  is a complete integral of the given equation  
and we have to find also singular integral and  the general integral assuming b equals to a    
So, the given relation is x minus a whole square  plus y minus b whole square plus z square minus  
c square equals to zero  So, if we differentiate  it partially with respect to a and b we will get  
the relation x minus a equals to zero and y minus  b equals to zero or a equals to x, b equals to y   
in mathematical physics, chemistry,  etcetera, in different fields and  
From this two equation if we eliminate a and  b from the equation f xyz ab equals to zero  
we will get the solution z equals to  plus minus c and this equation is a  
singular solution of the given equation   Alternatively one can find this singular solution  
from the given differential equation capital  F xyz pq equals to z square p square plus q  
square plus one minus c square equals to  zero  So, if you differentiate partially  
with respect to p and q we get p equals to zero  and q equals to zero  So, if you substitute  
the values of p and q in the given equation, we  will find a solution z equals to plus minus c   
This is a singular solution and we  are getting the same singular solution  
which we have obtained by eliminating  a and b from the general solution    
Now, we are interested to  find the general solution  
this is easy to handle  Moreover, the  concept of first order differential equation  
making b is equal to a, so the equation becomes x  minus a whole square plus y minus a whole square  
plus z square minus c square equals  to zero  Now, differentiating this  
minus y whole square plus z square minus  c square equals to zero  So, this solution  
is the required general solution or general  integral of the given first order equation    
Now, we are going to establish a function  and relation between two first order partial  
differential equation under which  these two equations are compatible   
Suppose we have two first order partial  differential equations, capital F xyz  
pq equals to zero and capital G xyz pq  equals to zero  Now, these two systems  
is useful to understand or study the  higher order partial differential equation   
are said to be compatible if a solution of the  former satisfies the latter and conversely   
zero that means we can find the solution  for p and q from the equation twelve    
and it is possible provided it satisfies the  sufficient condition of integrability that means  
Now, differentiating the first equation of  twelve that means capital F equals to zero we get  
So now, we are going to start module one and we  are going to our first slide of module one    
Now, multiplying the first equation by one and  the second equation by p and then if we add  
differentiating the function capital G with  respect to x and z in the similar way we can find  
a relation which is written in fourteen b   Now, if we eliminate  
px plus p p z from equations to fourteen  a and fourteen b we will get a relation  
From this equation one can  find the value of qx plus pq z  
which is written in fifteen a, so the  value of qx plus pq z is one by J,  
We have classified a general partial  differential equation in chapter one  Now,  
with respect to the variable p and q   Similarly,  
and using these expressions if you  substitute those in equation number thirteen  
that means if we put the values  of qx plus pq z and py plus qp z  
we will obtain a functional relation between  the function F and G which is written here    
So, if the function F and G satisfies this  relation we can say that these two systems  
are compatible, that means the solution of the  function f satisfies the equation g and the  
we want to do this classification in the context  of first order partial differential equation   
to explain the procedure more clearly   So, this is one example  
So, there are two given first-order partial  differential equations we have to prove their  
in this way   The box FG  
the expression which is written here, so where  capital F is given and capital G is given   
So, if you compute this we will get  the value of box FG equals to zero   
x y equals to zero are compatible systems   Therefore, in module one of chapter two we have  
given some basic ideas about first order partial  differential equation  First we classified a  
The general form of a first order differential  equation in two variables can be written  
first-order differential equation, then we  have discussed the origin of a first-order  
differential equations  We have defined different  type of solutions like general solutions,  
complete solutions and singular solutions and  lastly we have discussed about the compatibility  
In standard notation zx is denoted  by small p and zy is denoted by small  
q  So, equation one is written  as F xyz pq equals to zero    
differential equation  The entire chapter  is divided into five modules, in module one,  
In the similar way one can define a first-order  partial differential equation in three variables  
xy u in this form which is written  in equation number three  Here,  
form of a first-order linear differential  equation is given by equation number four,  
zx and zy and a quasi linear equation  is defined as a differential equation  
where the coefficients of P and  Q are function of xy and z    
So, the general form can be written in this  way which is given in equation number five  
we shall discuss about some basic ideas of  first-order partial differential equation   
So, this is one of the example of quasi linear  equation  x into z minus two y square p plus y  
into z minus y square minus two x square q  equals to z into z minus y square minus two x  
square and z p plus q plus nz square equals to  zero this is also a quasi linear equation    
And the next type of equation is semi-linear  equation  So, in the general form of a semi-linear  
first-order equation the coefficient of p and  q are function of only independent variables  
x and y, but in case of quasi linear equation a  and b may be function of the dependent variable  
z  So, this is one of the  example of semi-linear equation   
So, in both the equation the coefficient  of p and q are function of x and y only   
And the most complicated type  is the nonlinear equation  
where the equation does not belongs to any of the  three types which we have described already    
In module two, we shall discuss about first  order quasi linear partial differential equation,  
So, these are the examples of nonlinear equation  pq plus q cube equal to three pq, q plus xp equals  
to p square  Now, I am going to discuss the origin  of a first-order partial differential equation   
That means from which problem a first  order differential equation comes and  
what is the relation between a first order  differential equation and its solution   
In this regards I want to mention that in case of  ordinary differential equation if there is a one  
parameter system of curves, then it corresponds to  a first-order ordinary differential equation    
In case of two parameter family of curves, we get  a second-order ordinary differential equation   
Now, we are going to discuss is that any  relation like that in case of partial  
differential equation  So, to get that answer  let us go to the next slide  Suppose we have a  
in module three, we shall discuss about nonlinear  first-order partial differential equation  
and q equals to del z del y   Now, from these two equations  
if you eliminate a and b and substitute the  values of a and b in equation seven, you will  
Let us take one example to explain it clearly   x minus a whole square plus y minus b whole  
square plus z square equals to one it represents  a system of spheres with center at a b zero    
Now, if we differentiate that equation with  respect to a, x and y we will get the relation x  
and in module four, we shall discuss about  the Charpit’s methods and Jacobi's methods  
minus a plus zp equals to zero and y minus b plus  zq equals to zero  From these two equations we can  
find the values of a and b and if you substitute  these values of a and b in the original equation,  
we will get a relation of the form  z square into p square plus q square  
plus one equals to one  So, this is the  first order differential equation whose  
solution is x minus a whole square plus y minus  b whole square plus z square equals to one    
So, in this case eliminating two arbitrary  constants a and b we obtain a first-order  
y and z where z is the dependent  variable which is function of x and y  
and the function u and v are related  by the relation Phi u v equals to zero   
for solving a first-order differential  equation and in last module we shall discuss  
which are written here   Now, from these two equations we can eliminate  
zx q equals to del u v del xy or in other words  capital P small p plus capital Q small q equals  
to capital R where capital P capital Q capital R  has the expressions which are written in equation  
a first order differential equation by  eliminating the arbitrary function Phi   
To explain the above procedure  we are taking this example    
Let z is some function of xy by small z  Now,  from this equation if we differentiate it with  
about solution of a first-order differential  equation satisfying some given conditions    
So, from these two equations we get the  value of p by q in this form that means  
in the above two equation if we eliminate  f dash x, then we will get a relation  
in the form px minus qy equals to zero and  this is a first order differential equation   
So, in this case eliminating the function f we are  getting a first order differential equation    
Now, we will explain what is the difference  between the solutions of a first-order  
differential equation  In the first case we have  shown that a first-order differential equation  
can be obtained by eliminating two arbitrary  constants a and b from a given function f  
xyz ab equal to zero  And so this is the solution  of a first-order differential equation and  
this solution is known as complete  solution or complete integral   
First of all let me explain, what why should we  read first-order partial differential equation   
a first order differential equation   Therefore a solution of the type phi u v  
equals to zero is called a general  solution of the given equation   
There is another way to find general solution in  which we find the locus of a parametric family of  
curves which is called the characteristic of the  envelope of the family <?>f xyz f psi a</?> equals  
to zero where b is supposed to be a function  of a  Now, we shall illustrate all this concept  
using taking one example  So, before explaining  that example let us discuss about a singular  
solution  This is another type of solution in  which case we eliminate a from the equation  
small f equals to zero and del F del a equals  to zero and del f del b equals to zero    
And there is another way to find singular solution  from the given differential equation capital F  
The first order differential equation is  important because this type of equation arises  
﻿Now, I am going to teach module  two of chapter two 
cosines of the normal to the surface  therefore, this capital P capital Q  
capital R represent the direction ratios of some  straight line which is perpendicular to the normal  
to the surface to the integral surface  of the quasi linear equation 
Therefore, the straight line having direction ratios PQ R  represent the tangent to the given surface    
Suppose a particle starts from a point capital  N and move in the direction P Q capital R, then  
the curve prescribed by the particle lies on the  surface and for a given particular point in the  
values of P Q R is unique therefore, it represent  that from through a given fixed point capital M,  
the integral there is only integral, one integral  curve passes through that given point   
Therefore, the integral curve of dx by  P equals to dy by Q equals to dz by R  
lies entirely on the integral  surface of P P plus Q Q equals to R  
which is function of xy and z is equal to c one  and v which is function of xy and z is equal to  
or in other words one can say that the integral  curves of the simultaneous equation generate  
the integral surface of the given quasi linear  equations P P plus Q Q equals to R  So, this is  
the geometrical interpretation of a quasi linear  first order partial differential equation    
which is the solution of the simultaneous equation  and those curves are called characteristic curves   
So, how can we obtain the equation of a  characteristic curve? Suppose the equation  
of a characteristic curves is given in  parametric form that means xy and z can  
be written as some function of parameter, a  parameter small t, then the tangent vector  
to this curve is dx dt, dy dt and dz dt   Since the tangent vectors, the direction ratios  
of the tangent vector is proportional to capital  P capital Q capital R, so dx dt must be equals to  
c two are solution of the simultaneous equation  dx by capital P equals to dy by capital Q equals  
capital P, dy dt must be equals to capital Q and  dz dt must be equals to capital R, so equation  
three gives the equation of the characteristic  curves of the quasi linear equation one    
In the last section we have learned how to find  solution of a quasi linear partial differential  
equation now we shall use that concept to solve  some geometrical problems  Especially we shall  
find the integral surface passing through a  given curve and we shall obtain or learn how  
to find the system of integral surface which is  perpendicular to a given system of surfaces    
Now, I am going to discuss how to find  integral surface passing through a given curve  
suppose we have a quasi linear equation  P P plus Q Q equals to capital R  
and u equals to c one and v equals to  c two are the solution of the Lagrange  
auxiliary equation dx by p equals  to dy by Q equals to dz by R    
So, the solution of the quasi linear  equation P P plus Q Q plus Q Q equals to R  
is Phi uv equals to zero  And we are interested to  find the integral surface through the curve gamma,  
the equation of gamma is given in parametric  form, xyz are some function of parameter T,  
so u equals to c one and v equals to c two  are solution of the curve, therefore, uxt yt  
zt equals to c one and v xt yt zt equals to ct and  where t is the parameter  And from these above two  
equation one can eliminate t to find a relation  of the form Phi c one c two equals to zero    
Therefore, our desired solution or the general  solution of the given quasi linear equation  
is Phi u v equals to zero  Now, I shall  illustrate this idea taking one example,  
suppose we want to find the integral surface  of the quasi linear equation two y z minus  
three into P plus two x minus z Q equals to y into  two x minus three and the integral surface which  
So, in this theorem we can see that the  solution of the quasi linear equation  
passes through the circle z equals to zero  x square plus y square equals to two x    
Now, the auxiliary equation for the given equation  
can be written as dx by this equals  to dy by this equals to dz by  
as x square minus three x minus z square plus  six z equals to c one where c one is a constant  
and the another integral can be found easily  dx plus two into y dy minus dz equals to zero  
after integrating v is x plus y square minus two  z equals to c two where c two being constant    
Therefore, the general solution of  the given quasi linear equation is Phi  
u v equals to zero where the expressions for  u and v we have already derived, so Phi of  
X square minus three x minus z square plus six z  comma x plus y square minus two Z equals to zero   
P P plus Q Q equals to R is involved  with the solution of the simultaneous  
So, this is the general solution or the integral  surface of the given quasi linear equation   
Now, we are interested to find that integral  surface which passes through the given circle    
Now, the equation of the circle can be written  in parametric form as x equals to one plus cos t,  
y equals two sin t, z equals to zero  And if  we substitute this parametric form to the one  
integral u equals to c one it becomes one plus  cos t square minus three into one plus cos t  
equals to c one and v equals to c two, it  gives one plus cos t plus sin square t equals  
to c two  Now, from these two equation  one can eliminate t and get the relation  
two plus c one plus c two equals to zero  Therefore the equation of the required surface is  
two plus x square minus three x minus z square  plus six z plus x plus y square minus two z  
equals to zero and this relation is obtained  from two plus c one plus c two equals to zero  
equation which is given in equation one   Now, we shall first prove this theorem,  
and substituting the values of c one and c two, so  after simplification this is the required equation  
of the surface x square plus y square minus z  square minus two x plus four z equals to zero   
Now, we shall develop an idea  where we shall discuss how to find  
the system of surfaces which are orthogonal  to a given system of surface    
Suppose there is a one parameter system of  surfaces and this system is given by equation  
are proportional to del F del x del F del  y del F del z, that we have already know   
Orthogonally, then the normal to this surface z  equals to F xy which are proportional to del z  
del x del z del y minus one must be perpendicular  to del F del x, del F del y, del F del z  So,  
then we shall apply this theorem to  solve some mathematical problems   
using the condition of perpendicularity, we can  obtain a relation del F del x into del z del x  
plus del F del y into del z del y plus del  F del z into minus one equals to zero    
Or in other words or with this notation capital P  small p plus capital Q small q equals to capital R  
where PQR assumed as del F del x del F del y and  del F del z  And we are interested to find the  
values of P Q that means now we obtain a quasi  linear equation which is given in equation six  
and we want to find the solution  of the quasi linear equation six  
and we already know that the solution of the  quasi linear equation is related to the solution  
of a simultaneous equation which is known as the  Lagrange auxiliary equation and this is written in  
equation number seven  dx by del F del x equals to  dy by del F del y equals to dz by del F del z    
So, solution of the equation seven  will give the solution of the  
Now, u equals to xyz equals to c one is a solution  of equation one, therefore, if you take the total  
quasi linear equation which is written in six  and that will be our required system of surfaces  
which are orthogonal to the given system of  surfaces which is written in equation number five   
Now, we shall illustrate the idea taking  one simple example  So, let us take this  
example  We have to find the equation of system  of surfaces which cut orthogonally the cones of  
system x square plus y square plus z square  equals to c xy where c is a parameter    
So, the auxiliary equation for the  system of surfaces which are orthogonal  
to the given surface is dx by del F del x equals  to dy by del F del y equals to dz by del F del z   
So, if we know the expression for capital  F, so if we substitute these values,  
we obtain the simultaneous  equation which is written here  
and from this simultaneous equation one can  obtain easily two integrals so one integral  
differential of U you will get the relation  ux dx plus uy dy plus uz dz equals to zero  
is x square plus y square plus z square equals  to c one and another integral is x square minus  
y square by z square equals to c two   So, the general solution of this simultaneous  
equation or not this simultaneous equation, the  general solution of the quasi linear equation  
is Phi x square plus y square plus z square comma  x square minus y square by z square equals to zero  
or in explicit form, in explicit form  one can write equation in this form  
x square plus y square plus z square equals  to F of x square minus y square by z square   
Now, we shall take another example  to make the concept more clear    
So, in this example we have to find the surfaces  which intersect the given system of surfaces z  
into x plus y equals to c into three z  plus one where c is the arbitrary constant  
that means we have to find the system of  surfaces which cut this given system of  
and we also have that u equals to c one is the  solution of the simultaneous equation one    
This module is devoted to the theory of first order  quasi linear partial differential equation   
surfaces orthogonally and we have to find  that surfaces which passes through the  
circle x square plus y square  equals to one and z equals to one   
So, let us first try to find the system  of orthogonal surfaces  So, for that  
first the given system of surfaces can be written  in this form F xyz is from the given system of  
surfaces if we divide the left-hand side by three  z plus one, we obtain F xyz as z into x plus y,  
divided by three z plus one equals  to c, where c is the parameter    
So, if we vary the parameter c we will get a  system of surfaces  Now, the auxiliary equation  
for the orthogonal system of surfaces is given  by dx by del F del x equals to dy by del F del y  
equals to dz by del F del z  Now, substituting the  values of F from here, we can obtain the equations  
in this simplified form dx by z equals to dy by  z equals to three z plus one into dz by dx plus y  
Therefore, this equation ux dx plus  uy dy plus uz dz equals to zero and  
and from this equation one can obtain two  integrals easily, one is dx minus dy equals  
to zero, that means after integrating we will  get one integral x minus y equals to constant  
and some manipulation of this equation  will give the another integral  
so that can be obtained from this equation  x plus y into dx plus y minus six z square  
plus two z into dz equals to zero   Therefore one integral is u which is x  
minus y equals to c one and the another integral  is v which is equals to x minus y whole square  
minus two z square into two z plus one equals to  c two  Here c one c two are arbitrary constant   
Now, we want to find that integral surface  which passes through the given circle    
Now, the parametric equation of the given circle  can be written in this form x equals to cos t,  
y is equals to sin t, z equals to one  So, if  we substitute xyz, from this equation u equals  
the simultaneous equation one  are compatible to each other   
to c one, we obtain this relation cos t minus  sin t equals to c one and if we substitute the  
values of xyz in the second integral v equals  to c two, we obtain the another relation cos t  
plus sin t square minus six equals to c two   That is sin two t equals to, so from these two  
equation if we manipulate one can obtain the  value of sin two t as one minus c one square  
and from the second equation the value of sin  two t can be obtained as five plus c two  So,  
from these two equation we can eliminate t to  obtain a relation between the constant c one  
and c two, like c one square plus c two plus  four equals to zero  Now, if we substitute the  
values of c one c two, where c one is x minus y  and c two is written here the expression for v,  
so if you substitute those values we can  obtain a function relation like this    
So, this x square plus y square after  simplification we get that function as  
Now, from the earlier site, since dx dy dz are  proportional to P Q R, so from this equation we  
x square plus y square equals to two  z cube plus z square minus two  So,  
this is our required integral that means this  is the system of integral surfaces which are  
orthogonal to the given system of surfaces and  it also passes through the given circle    
Thus, in module two of chapter two we have  discussed about a quasi linear first order  
differential equation  We have defined that  equation  We have derived the Lagrange’s  
auxiliary equation for a quasi linear equation and  we discuss about the geometrical interpretation  
of that quasi linear equation and lastly we apply  the idea of solving a quasi linear differential  
equation to solve some geometrical problems  So,  in this way we end this module of chapter two 
In the similar way taking v is equal  to xyz as a solution of the equation  
dx by P equals to dy by Q equals to dz  by R, we can obtain the similar relation  
we will get P divided by del uv del yz equals to  Q divided by del uv del zx equals to R divided by  
del uv del xy  Now, we have already seen in module  one of this chapter that the relation Phi uv  
equals to zero leads to the partial differential  equation P del uv del yz plus Q del uv del zx  
We shall show that the solution of a first-order  quasi linear partial differential equation  
And this equation is known as the  equation, this equation means,  
the equation one is known as Lagrange auxiliary  equation, so we obtain that Phi uv equals to zero  
is a solution of the quasi linear equation P P  plus Q Q equals to R, where this u and v are the  
solution of the simultaneous equation one, which  is known as Lagrange’s auxiliary equation    
Now, we shall apply the previous theorem  to solve this mathematical problem   
In this example we have to find the general  integral of this quasi linear equation   
Now, we can write this equation in  standard form as this, some function of xyz  
into P and this is a function of xyz into  Q equals to some function of xy and z    
is linked with the solution of a simultaneous  equation and that simultaneous equation is  
capital Q equals to dz by capital R, here capital  P is the coefficients of small p for this example  
it is small x into z minus two y square and  capital Q is the coefficient of small q,  
which is for this example, y into z minus y square  minus two x cube and capital R is z into z minus y  
square minus two x cube  Now, it is easy to find  the solution of these simultaneous equation,  
if we observe this equation carefully, we can  see that from last two equations one can find  
the solution easily like this dy by y equals to  dy by z and solving this equation one can obtain  
y is equal to c one into z   Therefore, one can take  
an integral of the simultaneous equation u is  equal to y by z equals to c one  Now, we need  
to find another integral of the simultaneous  equation that means the function v, for that  
known as Lagrange’s auxiliary equation  We  shall give the geometrical interpretation  
we need some manipulation of the simultaneous  equation  So, we have done some mathematical  
formulas, we have manipulate this equation and we  obtain an equation like this which is written here  
dx by x equals to d into y square minus z divided  by y square minus z plus two x cube equals to dw  
So, our another integral is x square minus w by  x equals to constant that equals to c two  Now,  
substituting the value of W from here that means  putting the value of w as y square minus z,  
we will obtain the value or the expression  for v xyz as x square plus z by x minus y  
square by x square equals to c two  Therefore, the  general integral is Phi of uv equals to zero where  
u is y by z and v is x square plus z by x  minus y square by x square equals to zero    
of a first-order quasi linear equation  and lastly we shall use these concepts  
So, in this example we find that the solution  of the quasi linear equation can be obtained  
from the solution of the corresponding auxiliary  equation and it is easy to find the solution  
of quasi linear equation from the solution of  auxiliary equation  Now, now the previous idea can  
be extended for n number of independent variables  and the corresponding theorem is stated here,  
if ui x one x two x n z equals to c i where i  equals to one to n, vn independent solution of the  
ci’s are the constants and pi’s are  functions of the independent variables  
x one x two xn and the dependent variable  z and z is the function of x one x two xn  
and capital R is function of n independent  variables and the dependent variable z    
So, the solution of the ui’s are the solution  of the simultaneous equation four  Then the  
to give or to solve some geometrical problems  So,  let us go to the first slide of this module    
solution of the quasi linear equation which is  written in equation number five, P one P one plus  
P two P two plus Pn Pn equals to R is given  by Phi of u one u two u n equals to zero,  
where these Pi’s in equation number five,  small Pi's are the derivative of the dependent  
variable z with respect to the independent  variable xi  i equals to one two up to n    
Now, we illustrate the idea for  taking this example  In this example  
there are three independent variables xyz and one  dependent variable u  So, this is a first order  
quasi linear differential equation and we have  to solve this equation  So, the corresponding  
Lagrange auxiliary equation is dx by u plus y plus  z this is the function which is coefficient of del  
this is coefficient of del u del z  equals to du by x plus y plus z    
Now, I am going to state an  important theorem which says that  
And from this equation, simultaneous equation  one can find easily three integrals  Since there  
are three independent variables for the  general solution we need three integrals   
So, from this equation one  can obtain three integrals as  
x minus y by y minus z equals to c one and the  another integral y minus z by z minus u equals  
to c two and x plus y plus z plus u to the  power one-third into z minus u equals two c  
three  Therefore, the required general solution  of the given equation can be written in the form  
some function of u one u two u three equals to  zero  So, this is our required solution    
Now, I want to give geometrical interpretation of  a quasi linear first order differential equation  
that means the equation capital P small  p plus capital Q small q equals to R   
I want to give how the solution of a quasi linear  first order differential equation is what related  
the quasi linear first-order partial differential  equation capital P small p plus capital Q small q  
to a solution of simultaneous equation and what  is the geometrical meaning of this relation   
So, let us first take that z is equal to fxy  
is an integral surface of the given quasi linear  equation  P P plus QQ equals to capital R    
Now, if we write the equation of the surface,  integral surface in the form, in implicit form  
like f xyz minus f xy minus z equals to zero, then  the direction cosines of the normal to the surface  
can be written as del z del x del z del y minus  one and with the standard notation we can write  
look at the given equation, P P plus Q Q equals to  capital R and this equation can be written in this  
way capital P small p plus capital Q into small q  plus capital R into minus one equals to zero    
Now, if you observe these small p small  q's minus one this is the direction  
equals to capital R has the general  solution phi u v equals to zero where u  
﻿This is module three of chapter two  This  module is devoted to the theory of nonlinear  
determines a plane element of the type x zero, y  zero, gx zero, y zero, gx, x zero, y zero and gy,  
x zero, y zero  And this is called tangent element  of the surface S at the point x zero, y zero,  
the important theorem as which is written here, a  necessary and sufficient condition for a surface  
to be an integral surface of a  partial differential equation is that  
at each point, its tangent element  should touch the elementary cone    
Now, we want to derive Cauchy’s characteristic  equations  To derive that equation, we first  
consider there is a curve gamma  The equation  of which curve is given in parametric form,  
where t is the parameter  So, x is some function  of t, y is some function of t and z is also some  
function of t  And which lies on the surface  s  Therefore it will satisfy the equation  
which is written in equation two and which involve  two arbitrary constants, a and b, one can derive  
of the surface, so z equals to g, xt, yt,  for all t belongs to some interval I    
Then, if p zero is a point on gamma, determined  by the parameter t zero, then the direction  
ratios of the tangent line p zero p one are  x dash t zero, y dash t zero, z dash t zero,  
where dash denote the derivative with respect  to t, at the point t equals to zero, t zero   
The picture of this is given in figure two, where  p p zero is the tangent line to the curve gamma   
Now, the direction p zero q zero minus one is  perpendicular to x dash, y dash, z dash    
Therefore, p zero x dash plus q zero y dash plus  minus one z dash equals to zero  So, from this  
equation, one can write the value of z dash as z  dash equals to p zero x dash plus q zero y dash   
defines a strip at the point x, y, z of the  curve gamma, as it is shown in figure two   
a first order partial differential equation,  which is written in equation number one    
If such a strip is an integral element of the  
equation one, equation one means the equation  capital F x, y, z, p, q equals to zero, then  
that strip is called the integral  strip of the given equation   
the condition six and the condition F x, y,  z, p, q equals to zero for all t belongs to I   
Now, we are in the position of finding solution  
of a Cauchy problem  If at each point the curve  gamma touches a generator of elementary cone,  
then the corresponding strip is called  characteristic strip  So, let there is a  
point neighboring to the point x, y, z and having  coordinates x plus dx, y plus dy, z plus dz,  
it lies on the tangent plane to the elementary  cone, then dz must be equals to p dx plus q dy,  
So, starting from equation two, we can go to  equation one  And conversely one can prove that  
where p, q satisfy the equation one   Equation one means the given equation   
dq dp equals to zero  And from equation eight,  if we differentiate the equation with respect to  
which is written in nine  So, eliminating dq dp,  
or putting the value of dq dp from  the first equation to the second,  
we can get a relation between dx and dy  Now,  the equation eight and nine are compatible    
So from eight and nine, we can derive the  dx, dy and dz are proportional to Fp, Fq  
and pFp plus qFq respectively along the  characteristic strip  Now, we choose the parameter  
the solution of a first order equation,  which is written in equation one  
So, along the characteristic strip p  is also function of the parameter t  
and that function can be obtained in this way,  if you take p dash t, compute p dash t, it is  
del p del x dx dt plus del p del y dy dt   Now, substituting the values of x dash t and y  
dash t, we get this equals to del p del x  del F del p plus del p del y del F del q   
Now, the value of del q del x is  equals to the value of del p del y,  
which is proved here  The value of del p del  y can be written as del two z, del y del x   
Now, if we interchange the  order of the derivative,  
we get del two z, this equals to del two z del x  del y and which is nothing but del q del x    
So, in the previous equation we have used the  relation del p del y equals to del q del x   
Thus, we obtain the value of p dash  t is this  Now, if we substitute,  
is of the form, which is written in  equation two  Now, I shall define again,  
now if we differentiate equation number seven  with respect to x, equation number seven means  
the given equation, differential equation p, where  all the variables x, y, z, p, q are function of t   
So, if we differentiate equation number  seven, we will get with respect to x,  
we will get a relation in this form   And here, if we use the relation,  
if we use the value of p dash t as del F del  p del p del x plus del F del q del q del x,  
we obtain a relation, or rather we can find  the value of p dash t as minus of Fx plus p Fz   
In the similar way, we can find the value  of q dash t as minus of Fy plus qFz  Now,  
in equation number eleven  And this equation is  known as Cauchy’s characteristic equations    
And there is an important theorem which says that,  if a characteristic strip contains at least one  
various type of solution of a nonlinear  partial differential equation   
integral element of F x, p, q equals to zero,  then it is an integral strip of this equation   
Now, we are interested to find the integral  of a given equation, nonlinear equation  
which passes through a given curve gamma   
Thus, we are interested to find the solution of  capital F equals to zero and which passes through  
gamma  And the equation of gamma is written  in parametric form, small x is some function  
of zeta, y is some function of zeta  and z is some function of zeta    
And we know that for a given equation, we can find  Cauchy’s characteristic equation, which is set of  
five ordinary first order differential equation  which is written in equation number eleven  So,  
solution of that equation is of the type x is  some function of x zero, y zero, z zero, p zero,  
q zero, t zero, t  Similarly, all variables, y,  z, p, q, they are functions of x zero, y zero,  
So, we have seen in our first slide that  equation two is a solution of one, involving  
we are taking the given value of x from the  curve which passes through the curve gamma    
value of p zero, q zero can be obtained in this  way, dz equals to p zero dx plus q zero dy   
And z is function of chi zeta   So, dz, so if you take derivative,  
so chi dash zeta equals to p zero, phi  dash zeta plus q zero psi dash zeta   
So, we have a relation between, liner relation  between p zero and q zero in the first equation   
And we also have capital F which is function of  phi, psi, chi, p zero, q zero equals to zero    
So, solving this two equation, we can find the  values of p zero and q zero  Therefore all the  
variables, x, y, z, p, q are known in terms of x  zero, y zero, z zero, p zero, q zero and t zero   
two arbitrary constants a and b  This solution  is called complete integral of equation one    
So, x, y and z, they are function of only  
xi and t  So, there are three relation between  xi and t  So, among these three relation,  
we can eliminate xi and t to obtain  a functional form between x, y and z   
Theta x, y, z equals to zero, which is written in  equation number fourteen  So, this is our required  
general integral passing through the given  curve gamma, the equation of which is known    
Now, we shall take one example to make  the clear, to make the concept more clear   
So, take this example, we have to find the  characteristic of the equation pq equals to z  And  
to have to determine the integral surface which  passes through the parabola x equals to zero, y  
square equals to z  So, here, capital F that means  the given equation is pq minus z equals to zero   
And we can immediately write down the  corresponding Cauchy’s characteristic equation  
Suppose there exist a relation between  the parameters a and b of the form  
which is written here, x dash t equals to Fp, for  this case it is capital Q  y dash t equals to P  
and z dash t equals to two PQ and  p dash t is P, q dash t is Q    
The equation of the given curve is x equals  to zero, y square equals to z  So, our initial  
condition is x zero equals to zero, y zero  equals to zeta and z zero equals to zeta square   
So, this is parametric form of the given curve   
Now, using this relation, z zero dash equals  to p zero x zero dash plus q zero y zero dash   
we can obtain the value y zero dash is one   So, substituting these values, we can find the  
the values of p zero q zero in the given  equation, we can obtain the value of p zero as  
first order partial differential equation  We  have already defined different type of integrals  
zeta by two  Now, we have five equations,  x dash t equals to q, q dash t equals to q,  
and x, so from these two equation, we can find a  relation between x and q as x equals to q plus c  
one and also y dash equals to p, p dash equals  to p, we obtain a relation y is equal to p plus  
c two  Where c one, c two are constants   So, using the initial conditions one can obtain  
a relation between x and q as x equals to q minus  two zeta and y is equal to p plus zeta by two   
But in this equation, we also have p zero  t equals to p and q dash equals to q   
So, it gives p as c three e to the power t, and  after integrating we similarly get q is equal to  
c four e to the power t  And the values of  c three, c four can be obtained using the  
initial value  So, these values become  zeta by two and c four two zeta    
So, we get the value of p as zeta by two e to  the power t and value of q as two zeta e to  
zero is also a solution of the given equation   And the envelope of this one parameter system  
the power t  So, we get x is some function of x  and zeta, y is also some function of x and zeta   
So, from these two equation, we can find value  of e to the power t, which is written here and  
value of zeta which is some function of  x and y, which is also written here    
But, we need to apply the differential equation  for z, which is z dash t equals to two pq  So,  
if you substitute the values of p and q, and  after integrating we get z equals to zeta square  
e to the power two t, where we have used the  initial condition z zero equals to zeta square  
at t equals to zero  Now, in this expression, if  we substitute the value of zeta and e to the power  
t from the previous slide, we obtain z as  some function of x and y, which is written  
here sixteen z equals to x  plus four y whole square    
So, this is our required integral, so this is  our required integral which passes through the  
constitute a solution of the given equation one,  and that solution is known as general integral  
given parabola and the equation x equals to  two zeta e to the power t minus one, y is  
equal to zeta by two e to the power t plus one  and z equals to zeta square e to the power two   
These are the Cauchy’s characteristic curve   We know that, a nonlinear partial differential  
equation is very difficult to solve compared to  a linear and quasi linear differential equation   
In this module we have discussed a geometrical  way to solve a nonlinear partial first order  
differential equation, which is known  as Cauchy’s method of characteristic   
of equation one  There is another type of integral  which is known as singular integral  And it is,  
it can be obtained by considering the envelope  of the two parameter system of surfaces two    
So, if we calculate or evaluate  the envelope of two parameter  
system of surfaces two, that solution will  give a singular solution of the equation one   
Now, we shall take one equation, one  example to explain all type of solutions   
We have to show that the solution of this equation  is z equals to ax plus b y plus a plus b minus ab,  
and which is complete integral  of the given equation    
of a first order differential equation  In  this module, we shall define different type  
And we have to show, that envelope of all  planes corresponding to complete integrals  
provided singular integral of the differential  equation and we have to determine a general  
integral by find the envelope of these  planes, and which also passes through origin   
Now, we write the function f which is the  general integral in the form f x, y, z, a,  
value of p in this solution is constant   That means we can obtain the complete integral  
to zero is a complete integral of the equation  z equals to px plus qy plus p plus q minus pq   
Now, the envelope of this two parameter  system will give the singular solution  
of the given equation  So, to obtain the singular  solution, we solve the equation f equals to zero,  
of integrals taking a nonlinear equation,  first order non linear equation   
del f del a equals to zero, and  del f del b equals to zero    
So, if we write the equations it will be in this  form  The first equation corresponds to f equals  
to zero  And the second equation corresponds to  del f del a equals to zero  And the third equation  
corresponds to del f del b equals to zero  So,  from last two equation, one can obtain the values  
of a and b easily  And if we substitute the  values of a and b in the first equation,  
we will get z as function of xy which is  written here as x plus one into y plus one   
And this solution is the singular  solution of the given equation    
Now, we want to find a general  integral of the given equation   
To find general integral, suppose a and b are  related by the relation b is equal to psi a   
Now, from f equals to zero, if we put the  value of b as psi a, we obtain a relation  
And then mainly we shall discuss the Cauchy’s method  of characteristic, to find solution of a nonlinear  
which is written in the slide  And to find  the general integral, we have to find the  
envelope of the one parameter system which  is written here  So, to obtain the envelope  
of one parameter system, where a is the  parameter, we have to solve f equals to zero  
together with del f del a equals to zero   The expression for del f del a  
is written here  So, now we have to solve f  equals to zero, del f del a equals to zero   
And we have to find that integral which passes  through origin  So, in the previous expression,  
in the expression for f, we substitute x equals  to zero, y equals to zero and z equals to zero   
Since the integral passes through origin,  we get a relation minus a minus psi a  
plus a psi a equals to zero, which gives the  expression for psi a as a by a minus one    
And we can immediately find  the value of psi dash a  
first order partial differential equation  So,  let us go to the first slide of this module    
as minus one by a minus one whole square  Now, we  have another equation del f del a equals to zero   
So, in del f del a equals to zero,  if we substitute the values of psi a  
and psi dash a, we can obtain a relation  which is written here  And from that equation,  
we can find the value of a as square root of  y by x plus one  So, taking this value of a,  
we can write down the functional form of  psi as root y plus root x by root y    
Now, in the expression f equals to zero, if  we substitute, in the expression f equals to  
zero if we substitute the values of a and  psi a, we obtain a function z equals to  
root y root x by root y into x plus root y root x  by root y into y and so on, which is written here   
So, after simplification, we get equation of the  integral surface or the general integral is x  
plus y minus z whole square equals to four xy  So,  this is our general integral  So, in this example,  
Suppose a nonlinear partial  differential equation is given,  
we calculate the complete integral, singular  integral and the general integral    
Now, I am going to explain Cauchy’s method of  characteristic to find complete integral of a  
given nonlinear first order differential equation   This method is based on a geometrical idea   
First of all, we shall derive the  Cauchy’s characteristic equations,  
then using that concept we shall find general  integral of a nonlinear equation passing through  
a given curve  So, let us go to the slide show  of the Cauchy’s characteristic equation    
Before describing Cauchy’s  method of characteristic,  
I will give some definition of some  elementary things  Suppose, there is a point p  
having coordinates x zero, y zero, z zero  And  we want to draw a plane through the point P    
So, one can draw infinite number of planes passing  through point P  So, to uniquely specify a plane,  
which is written in this slide in equation number  one, where capital F is function of x, y, z, p and  
we need the direction ratios of the normal  to the plane  Let, let us fix that direction  
at, in the direction n which has the  components p zero, q zero, minus one    
Suppose a plane element x zero, y zero, z zero, p  zero, q zero satisfy the equation one, that means  
equation one is the given partial  first order differential equation   
So, then the plane element is  called the integral element    
And the equation in equation one, we have capital  F x, y, z, p, q equals to zero  And from that  
equation, we can obtain the value of q as some  function of p, which is written in equation  
three  And suppose that function is g  Now, if  we fix the point x, y, z and vary the point P,  
q  This small p is del z del x and small q is del  z del y  And capital F is a nonlinear function   
we will get a set of plane elements in the form  x zero, y zero, z zero, p, G x zero, y zero,  
z zero P  That means the set of elements are such  that all the planes passes through the fix point  
x zero, y zero, z zero, but the direction of the  normal are different for the different planes    
Therefore, this set of planes envelope a cone  and all this cone passes through the fix point P   
And this cone is known as elementary cone  of the given equation one at the point P   
The picture of that elementary cone is  shown here  So, P is our fixed point and  
a particular position of the plane element is  given here, and n is the normal to the plane   
Now, consider a surface S, having equation z  equals to g x, y, where the function g x, y and  
its first order partial derivatives with respect  to x and y are continuous in some defined region,  
capital omega in x, y plane   Then the tangent plane at every point of S,  
And we have already seen that  if we start with a function,  
This is module four of chapter two  In this module, we shall discuss about two powerful
becomes dz equals to one by square root za square plus a square dx plus a by za square
plus a square dy 
After integrating, we can get a relation which is written here and the last relation we obtain
after simplification function of x, y, z which is z into square root z square plus a square
plus a square log z plus square root z square plus a square equals to two into x plus ay
thus it represent a  Now, I am going to discuss the third type of equation where
the given equation is separable 
That means suppose the given equation is capital F x, y, z, p, q equals to zero, and the equation
is said to be separable if the equation can be written in the form some phi xp equals
equals to zero which is written in equation two and in this equation there is one arbitrary
Then the corresponding Charpit equation becomes dx by phi p equals to dy by minus psi q equals
to dz by p psi x minus q psi y equals to dp by minus phi x equals to dq by minus psi y 
And taking the first dx by phi p equals to dp by minus phi x, we can get a relation of
the form phi p dp plus phi x dx equals to zero  So, after integrating we can get an
integral phi xp equals to a  Similarly, we can get psi yq equals to a  Now, we shall
So, F can be written as p square y into one plus x square minus q x square equals to zero 
So, from this equation, we can separate the function of x and p on left hand side and
the right hand side a function of q and y  So, let the function of x and p as phi, so
constant a is involved 
phi xp is p square into one plus x square by x square, and psi yq equals to q by y 
Then Charpit’s equations can be written in the form which is given in the slide 
will get a relation between q and y as q equals to some a square y where a square is a constant 
So, psi is q by y equals to a square  Therefore phi, since phi is equals to psi, so phi must
be equals to a square  That means p square into one plus p square by x square equals
to a square  So, from here one can obtain the value of p as ax by square root one plus
x square  Now, if you take the differential object dz and if you substitute the values
After integrating, we get z equals to a square root one minus x square plus half a square
And we also assume that we can solve equation one and two are solvable for the variables
y square plus b square  So, this is the, of the given equation  And the last type I want
to discuss, when the given equation is given in Clairaut’s form  An equation f x, y,
equals to dp by zero equals to dq by zero 
So, from this equation, one can easily obtain that dp equals to zero  So, it gives the solution
p equals to a constant a and q equals to another dq equals to zero gives the solution q equals
to b where a and b are constants  So, if you substitute the values of p and q in equation
p and q  Therefore solving equation one and two, one can obtain p, as function of x, y,
where the equation is given in Clairaut’s form  So, this is our equation z minus px
minus qy equals to p square plus q square 
So, this equation can be written in standard form as z equals to px plus qy plus p square
plus q square  So, the corresponding Charpit’s equations are written below  dx by x plus
two q square equals to dp by zero equals to dq by zero  So, solving this equation, we
can get p is equal to constant a and q is equal to constant b  So, the complete integral
is z equals to ax plus by plus a square plus b square 
Now, I am going to discuss Jacobi’s method for solving a nonlinear first order partial
differential equation  In the in this course, I shall discuss the method taking two independent
z, a and similarly q as function of x, y, z and a  Now, consider about the total differential
variables and one dependent variable  The advantage of Jacobi’s method over Charpit’s
variables, whereas Charpit’s methods cannot be extended that much easy way for n number
of variables  So, let me discuss the Jacobi’s method in the first slide 
Suppose, if we have a nonlinear equation which is written in equation number ten, F x, y,
minus u one by u three and q, which is del z del y, can be written as minus u two by
x, y, z respectively 
of the dependent variable z which is function of x and y, so it can be written as dz equals
Therefore, substituting the values of p and q from equation twelve to equation ten, we
can obtain a relation of the form f x, y, z, u one, u two, u three equals to zero, which
is written in equation number thirteen  Now, we shall introduce another two first order
partial differential equations involving two arbitrary constants which are g equals to
zero and h equals to zero, which are written in equation number fourteen  And we also assume
that equations thirteen that means the given equation here and equation fourteen
are solvable for u one, u two, u three 
is integrable  So, under this two assumption, we can find the solution of the given equation 
Now, what is the meaning of this conditions? So, if we take equation thirteen and fourteen,
so those two equations are compatible  That means, the box fg equals to zero, box gh equals
to zero, box hf equals to zero  Now, box fg equals to zero , if you expand the box, you
del fg del z u three equals to zero 
So, after expansion we will get the next line  Now, the auxiliary equation for this equation
can be written as dx by f u one equals to dy by f u two equals to dz by f u three equals
to d u one by minus f x equals to d u two by minus f y equals to d u three by minus
f z, which is written in equation number sixteen  And this equation is known as Jacobi’s equation 
So, solving this Jacobi’s equation, if we can get two integral, then that will solve the purpose
of solving the given equation 
q  So, substituting the values of p and q from the above equation, one can write the
So, if you take one example, the idea will be more clear  So, let us take this example 
We have to find the solution of z square equals to pqxy by Jacobi’s method  So, the given
relation can be written as f equals to z square minus pqxy equals to zero  So, here p which
is del z del x is minus u one by u three, q is minus u two by u three  So, from the
given equation if we substitute the values of p and q, we obtain small f function as
u one u two xy minus u three square z square equals to zero 
And from this equation, one can get the Jacobi’s equation as dx by u two xy equals to dy by
u one xy equals to dz by minus u three z square equals to d u one by minus u one u two y equals
to d u two by minus u one u two x equals to d u three by two u three square into z  So,
equation three 
equals to minus d u one by u one  After integrating we can get u one x equals to constant, let’s
say a  And taking dy and d u two, so dy by y equals to minus d u two by u two we get
another integral u two x equals to constant say b 
So, from the equation f x, y, z, u one, u two, u three equals to zero, if we substitute
the values of u one, u two, that means in the equation u one u two xy minus u three
square z square equals to zero, we can obtain the value of u three as u three equals to
square root ab by z  So, now we have the values of u one, u two and u three  Now, we have
u three dz 
So, substituting the values of u one, u two and u three after integrating we get the complete
Now, integrating equation three, one can get a relation of the form small f x, y, z, a,
methods, namely Charpit’s method and Jacobi’s method for finding solution of a nonlinear
integral as u equals to log c x to the power a y to the power b z to the power square root
ab where c is a constant  So, in this way, one can obtain the complete integral of a
given equation using Jacobi’s method  In this module we have discussed, Charpit’s
method and Jacobi’s method, and how to apply these methods to find solution of a first
order partial differential equation 
These two methods are very useful because this method can be applied to any type of
first order differential equation means to a linear differential equation, quasi linear
differential equation  Overall one can apply these methods to a nonlinear first order partial
differential equations  So, this module ends here 
b equals to zero  And equation four is of the given equation one  Since it involves
in this way which is described in this slide  So, in the Charpit’s method, the basic assumption
is J Jacobean of the function F G with respect to p and q is not equals to zero 
That means, we can find the values of p and q from the relation F equals to zero and G
That means the box F G equals to zero  And we have already learned that compatibility
of two functions gives the box of F G equals to zero  Now, if we expand this box, we obtain
partial differential equation  We shall find the complete integral of a given nonlinear
We obtain this relation in chapter one  Now, from this equation, like Lagrange’s auxiliary
equation, we can write another auxiliary equation which is known as Charpit’s equation and
it is written in equation number five  So, Charpit equation is given by dx by Fp, dy
qFz which is coefficient of del G del q 
Now, solving this simultaneous equation is easy  So, now our task is to find the solution
of the simultaneous equation which is written in five  Now, we shall take one example to
partial differential equation and the entire module, we shall take two independent variables
pq plus qy minus yz equals to zero  This is a nonlinear first order partial differential
equation  So, this equation can be written in the form capital F equals to pxy plus pq
The Charpit equations, equation for the given function can be written as we have discussed
So, after integrating p is some constant equals to a say and from the given equation, see
if you substitute the value of p in the given equation, that means pxy plus pq plus qy minus
yz equals to zero, one can obtain the value of q as y into z minus ax by y plus a 
and one dependent variable  So, let me first explain the Charpit’s method in our first slide 
can get a solution z minus ax into y plus a to the power a equals to b into e to the
power y, where b is a constant and a is also a constant  Therefore this is our required
integral and this is the general integral since it involves two arbitrary constants
small a and small b 
Now, Charpit equations can be simplified in some particular cases  Now, I am going to
discuss those particular cases  Suppose the equation is given in the form such that it
involves only p and q, that means the equation can be written in the form capital Fpq equals
to zero, which is written in equation number six  So, the corresponding Charpit equation
First we shall discuss Charpit’s method of solution  Suppose we have a given equation
So, from this equation, we can find dq equals to zero means q equals to constant a 
Now, if we substitute the value of a in the given equation, we can find value of p as some function
F of a, which is also a constant  Now, if we substitute the values of p and q in the
expression for dz, so we obtain dz equals to pdx plus qdy  Therefore it becomes f adx
Now, we shall take another example which we have to solve using Charpit method, the equation
is given p plus q equals to pq  So, here the given equation can be written in the form
p plus q minus pq equals to zero  And the corresponding auxiliary equation or the Charpit
equation can be written in this form dx by one minus q equals to dy by one minus p equals
capital F x, y, z, p, q equals to zero, which is written in equation number one 
to dz by this, dp by zero equals to dq by zero 
So, after integrating we get one value of q as q equals to constant equals to a and
substituting this value of q in the given equation means p plus q equals to pq, we can
get the value of p as a by a minus one  Now, substituting the values of p and q in dz,
Now, I shall discuss another simplified form of Charpit equation where the given equation
does not involve the independent variables x and y  So, the equation can be written in
the form Fzpq equals to zero, which is written in equation number seven  So, the corresponding
auxiliary equation is written in the next line dx by Fp equals to dy by Fq equals to
So, this is a nonlinear equation and this is first order equation where small p and small q are
So, from this equation, for this particular form, we can see that last two equation, from
the last two equation we can obtain a relation between p and q, like q is equal to a into p
where a is a constant  Now, if you substitute the value of q in the given equation, that
means in equation number seven, we can find the value of p as some function of az 
That means we get p as some function of az and q is some function of az 
Now, in the total differential of z that means dz equals to pdx plus qdy, we get relation
solution of the given equation seven easily  Now, we shall illustrate this idea taking
one example  Suppose this is our given, so let us take this example  Example we have
respectively del z del x and del z del y  So, in Charpit’s methods, the basic idea
to solve the equation p square z square plus q square equals to one  So, this is a nonlinear
first order partial differential equation  And the equation does not involve any x and y 
So, this is our case two, so in this case, the auxiliary equation can be written in this
form, dx by two pz square equals to dy by two q equals to dz by two p square z square
plus two q square equals to dp by minus two pqz equals to dq by minus two p square qz 
So, from last two equation, one can obtain a relation between q and p as q is equal to
a into p where a is an arbitrary constant 
Now, if we substitute the value of q in the given equation, that means p square z square
plus q square minus one equals to zero, one can obtain the value of p as p equals to one
divided by square root za square plus a square  Thus, the equation dz equals to pdx plus qdy
In module five of chapter two, I shall discuss about integral surfaces satisfying some given
And this is obtained by substituting the value of z from equation of gamma to the equation
z plus a square x equals to axy plus bx square  Now, the condition for having two equal roots
we get a relation between b ac d as b is equals to d plus minus ac  Now, taking b is equal
to d plus ac, the subsystem becomes z plus a square x equals to axy plus d plus ac into
Now, it has the envelope x square cx plus y whole square equals to four x into z minus
dx square, that means this is the solution and we know that the envelope is also the
solution of the given equation, therefore x into y plus cx whole square equals to four
into z minus dx square represent another integral of the given equation and since this solution
involve two arbitrary constants c and d, so this is the complete integral of the given
be a particular case of the general integral corresponding to two, that is the envelope
equation  So, in this example we have explained or rather we can say we have derived one complete
integral from the other 
Now, I shall discuss how to find integral surface circumscribing a given surface  Two
surfaces are called to circumscribe each other if they touch in a curve  That curve may not
be a planar curve  For example, a conicoid and its circumscribing and its enveloping
cylinder are circumscribed by each other  The procedure of finding this type of integral
surface is similar as we described in the previous section  So, for derivation let us
go to the slide show of this topic 
Suppose we have the partial differential equation F equals to zero, and let it has complete
of a one-parameter subsystem of two or it may be the envelope of a two-parameter system
a given surface sigma, the equation of that surface is phi equals to zero, which is written
So, now we are interested to find the integral surface E which is touched or circumscribe
by the surface gamma through the curve, by the surface sigma through the curve gamma 
Now, E is the envelope of a one-parameter subsystem S of a two-parameter system two
and so it is touched at each point P of gamma by a member SP of the subsystem
envelope of the set of equations or set of surfaces two, which touch the surface seven 
Now, the surface two that means the complete integral of the given equation touches the
of two, that means it may be a singular integral  But, in practice the case two occurs most
x equals to fy by phi y equals to fz by phi z are consistent 
The equation nine represent that where the two surfaces two and eight meets the
y, z, from the four equations, that means two equations in equation number nine and
one equation in two and one equation in seven  So, there are four equations, so from these
four equations, if we eliminate x, y, z, we can find a relation between a and b which
is written in equation ten as chi a, b equals to zero 
From chi a, b equals to zero we can find the value of b as function of a chi one a or it
frequently, so we shall discuss only case two now 
of two each of which touches seven  And the intersection of this surface with sigma gives
the curve gamma  And each of the relations eleven defines a subsystem whose envelope
E touches sigma along gamma 
Now, we shall take one example, which is given here in this slide  We have to find integral
surface of the equation, the given equation is two y into one plus p square equals to pq
whose equation is circumscribed about the cone  So, circumscribing surfaces is a cone
which is given by the equation x square plus z square equals to y square  So, this is our
required, we have to prove the required integral is z square equals to y square into four y
square plus four x plus one 
Now, we shall go to the solution of this problem, so the given equation capital F is two y into
one plus p square minus pq equals to zero  So, the corresponding auxiliary equations
are written in the next line and from this equation, simultaneous equation, it is easy
to find that dp by dp equals to zero  So, p equals to constant, let say that constant
is small a and from the given equation, capital F equals to zero if you substitute the value
of p, we will get the value of q as two y into one plus a square divided by a 
Now, using the relation dz equals to pdx plus qdy, substituting the values of p and q, we
get a relation between dx, dy, dz which is written here  And after integrating we get z
is some function of a and b where a, b are two arbitrary constants  So, this represent
a complete integral of the given equation  Now, this equation can be written in this
the complete integral and which passes through a curve gamma  Then at its every point the
form small f equals to z minus ax minus y square into one plus a square by a minus b
equals to zero 
And the equation of the circumscribing surface psi is given as psi equals to x square plus
y square minus z square equals to zero  So, for circumscribing a surface we have the relation
fx by psi x equals to fy by psi y equals to fz by psi z  So, using that relation we get
small x as some function of a which is written here and small z is another function of a
which is written here, a by two into one plus a square  And also we have to satisfy f equals
to zero and psi equals to zero 
So, f equals to zero gives y square as two into a minus two b by two into one plus a
envelope S is touched by a member of the subsystem  In particular, at each point P of the curve
Now, we remain to apply the condition psi equals to zero  So, if we use this condition
where psi is x square plus y square minus z square is equal to zero, we obtain a functional
relation between a and b which is for this case b is equal to a by four  Now, in the
given equation means in the complete integral, f equals to zero, that means z minus x minus
y square into one plus a square by a minus b equals to zero 
In this complete integral, if you substitute the value of b as a by four and if we calculate
the envelope of this one parameter family of curves, we get the envelope as z square
equals to y square into four y square plus four x plus one  So, this is our required
integral which circumscribe the given equation of the surface for this case it is a cone 
Now, we have reached the last module of chapter two  This chapter is devoted to the theory
of first order partial differential equation  In the first module of this chapter we have
discussed about the basic ideas of a first order partial differential equation  In module
two we have discussed about a quasi linear first order partial differential equation 
We have derived Lagrange auxiliary equation for a quasi linear equation and in third chapter
we have discussed about a nonlinear partial differential equation  And in this chapter
we have derived and discussed the Cauchy’s method of characteristic to find a nonlinear
Charpit’s method and Jacobi’s method to find solution of a nonlinear partial first
order differential equation 
And in the last module we have just discussed how to find integral surface of a given equation
Since SP touches S at P, it also touches S at the same point  So, S is the envelope of
satisfying some given conditions  So, in these five modules we have discussed different type
of first order partial differential equations and we have discussed different type of solutions
of these equations, thus this chapter will help us to understand any kind of first order
partial differential equation  In this way we end the last module and the chapter two 
a one-parameter subsystem two each of whose members touches the curve gamma, provided
conditions  I shall mainly discuss three different things like integral surfaces passing through
that such a subsystem exist  Now, to determine S we have to consider subsystem made up of
the curve gamma touches the surface two, the equation two has two equal roots 
So, solving equation three and four, we can get a functional relation between a and b as phi a, b equals to zero 
And from that equation we can find b is some function of psi one a or b is some
function of psi two a  So, this each of this subsystem will give the envelope of the original equation
Now, we shall explain the previous method taking this example, we have to find complete
a given curve, and I shall discuss the integral surface circumscribing a given surface and
integral of the equation p square x plus qy equals to z and we have to find the integral
surface which passes through the curve, for this case it is a line y is equal to one,
x plus z equals to zero  So, our given equation is capital F equals to z minus p square x
minus qy equals to zero, and we have already learned in module two the Charpit’s equations 
So, the corresponding Charpit's equation becomes which is written in the next line dx by minus
two px equals to dy by minus q equals to dz by minus two p square x minus qy equals to
dp by p square plus p equals to dq by zero  Now, from the last equation we get q as constant
equals to a, say  Now, from the given equation F equals to zero, if we put the value of q,
we can obtain the value of p, which is written here z minus ay by x to the power half 
Now, using the relation dz equals to pdx plus qdy and substituting the values of p and q
I shall derive one complete integral from a given another complete integral 
we get the equation dz minus ay by z minus ay to the power half equals to dx by x to
the power half  So, after integration we get a relation z minus ay to the power half equals
to x to the power half plus b to the power half, where b is an arbitrary constant  And
that equation can be written in the form x plus ay minus z plus b
whole square equals to two bx 
Now, this equation involves two arbitrary constants a and b, so this is the complete
integral of the given equation  Now, we have to find that integral which passes through
the given equation of the line, now the parametric form of the equation of the line can be written
in this form x equals to t, y equals to one, z equals to minus t  If we substitute the
values of x, y, z from two to one, we get a relation which is written here, four t square
So, let us first discuss the first integral surface passing through a given curve 
plus four at plus a plus b whole square equals to zero 
Since this is the envelope of the given system, it has two equal roots  So, the condition
of two equal roots gives a square equals to a plus b whole square  And after simplification
the complete integral which is written in one can be obtained by substituting the value
of b s minus two a 
So, that one-parameter system is written here, y minus two whole square a square plus x minus
z whole square plus two into x y plus two minus z y minus two into a equals to zero 
the envelope of this system we have to solve this equation together with del del a of this
So, go to the slide show of that equations  Suppose we want to find integral of the equation one,
function equals to zero 
So, solving these two equations if we eliminate a from those two equation we get a function
which is written in the last line x into y plus two minus z into y minus two whole square
equals to y minus two whole square into x minus z whole square  So, the function z defined
by this equation is the solution of the problem  So, this is the general integral of the given
equation which passes through the given line 
complete integral small f x, y, z, a, b equals to zero  And we now show that there exist
another relation g x, y, z, c, d equals to zero and which is also the complete integral
of the given equation  Since in the solution which is written in six involves two arbitrary
capital F equals to zero, which passes through the curve, which is written in parametric
constants c and d, it also represent a complete integral 
Now, on the surface six we choose a curve gamma whose equations contain two arbitrary
constants c and d  Now, we shall find the envelope of the one-parameter subsystem of
two touching the curve gamma, where two is the equation small f x, y, z, a, b equals
to zero  Now, we illustrate this idea taking one simple example 
Suppose we have a partial differential equation two xz plus q square equals to x into xp plus
yp  We have to show that it has the complete integral z plus a square x equals axy plus
bx square and from that we have to derive that x into y plus cx whole square equals
to four into z minus dx square is also a complete integral of given equation 
Now, I shall discuss the solution  The given equation can be written in the form capital
form x equals to xt, y equals to yt, z equals to zt, where t is the parameter 
F equals to two xz plus q square minus x into xp plus yq equals to zero  Now, the corresponding
Charpit equations are dx by minus x square equals to dy by two q minus xy equals to dz
by minus px square plus two q square minus qxy equals to dp by minus two z plus yq equals
to dq by minus qx 
Now, from this auxiliary equation, if you take the first and last equation, we can find
the integral easily q as function of ax as ax, where a is a constant  Now, from the given
equation F equals to zero, if you substitute the value of q, we can find the value of p,
obtain a Pfaffian differential equation which is written here 
And this can be solved, we can find the integral of this equation, the integral of this equation
Now, the integral, maybe particular case of a complete integral small f x, y, z, a, b
is written in the last line z plus a square x equals to axy plus b y square 
So, this is the complete integral of the given equation which we need to proof, so that is proofed here 
in equation one 
So, from the equation of the surface if we put y is equal to zero, we get the value of
z as c square x cube plus four dx square by four  So, equation of the curve gamma is written here 
Now, at the intersection of the complete integral which we have obtained as function
a square equals to zero 
Now, I am going to start module one of chapter three  Chapter three is devoted to the theory
telegraphy equation  And this is an equation with unknown function E 
Similarly, from the equation, from the above equation nine and ten, if we differentiate
the first equation nine with respect to t and equation ten with respect to x, we obtain
the equations which is written here, del two E del t del x plus R del i del t plus L
del two i del t square equals to zero and del two i del x square plus G del E del x plus
C del two E del x del t equals to zero 
And from these equations if we eliminate the variable E, one can obtain an equation in
variable i to the equation, which is similar to the equation thirteen only E is replaced
by the variable i  That means one can say that the equation thirteen is satisfied by
And we shall show that with some transformation in independent variables, we can transform
equivalent to zero  And if we put G is equal to zero and L equals to zero in equation number
thirteen, one can see that thirteen reduces to the equation del E del t equals to k del
two E del x square, where k equals to RC to the power minus one 
This equation is also called telegraphy equation but it is mostly known as the heat conduction
we are interested to high frequency phenomena  So, for that case time derivative is most important,
so one can assume R equals to zero and G equals to zero in equation number nine 
So in, so if we assume R equals to zero and G equals to zero in equation nine and ten,
the equation to a second order equation with constant coefficients and lastly in third
we can get equation which is written here del two E del t square equals to c square
del two E del x square, where c equals to LC to the power minus half and this equation
partial differential equation 
Now, I am taking one example from electronics where one can get second order PDE  So, in
electronics we are considering this example, so according to Gauss’ law of flux of electric
vector E out of a surface S which bounding an arbitrary volume V is four pi times the
charge contained in the volume V  So, that can be written in the integral form like integration
of E  dS over S equals to four pi integration of rho dv 
In the left hand side, the integration is the surface integration and in the right hand
module we shall discuss about the canonical form of a second order differential equation
side, it is volume integration and rho is the density of electric charge  And all of
we know that Gauss' divergence theorem says that surface integration of E over the surface
S is equals to divergence of the function E over the volume V which is written here 
So, from if we use the Gauss' theorem then we obtain the surface integration of divergence
then we get divergence of E is equals to four pi rho 
Now, if we assume that E is derivable from a potential phi such that E is equals to minus
equation which is written in equation number fifteen grad square phi equals to minus four
pi rho and this is a famous equation which is known as Poisson’s equation 
and we shall derive how to obtain the canonical form from a given equation and in this way
And this is again we are getting a second order partial differential equation and this is a linear equation 
And if there is no any charge then rho can be assumed as zero, then fifteen is reduces
to an equation grad square phi equals to zero and which is known as Laplace equation or
a second order partial differential equation and which are also linear 
Now, I am taking few example to illustrate that how a second order differential equation
can be obtained when the dependent variable is sum of two unknown function  So, let us
take this example, let z is sum of two unknown function f and g, where f and g are function
of x square minus y, x square plus y respectively  And we don’t know the functional form of f and g 
So, they are arbitrary function 
we shall finish chapter three 
take derivative of the functional relation with respect to x, so we get del z del x equals
to two x f dash plus two x g dash  And if you take derivative with respect to y, we
get del z del y equals to minus f dash plus g dash and taking derivative with respect
to x once again the first equation we get, del two z del x square equals to, the expression
is written here 
So, from this equation we want to obtain a functional relation between the derivatives,
so for that we need to eliminate the unknown functions  But, in these equations the unknown
functions are present in the form of derivatives, so we need to eliminate f dash, g dash, f
double dash and g double dash  So, the expression for del two z del y square can be obtained
So, let us go to the first slide of module one of chapter three  Now, I am going to discuss
in the similar way 
So, if we eliminate these functions f and g and their first order derivative and second
order derivative and if we compute this del two z del x square minus one by x del z del
equation, so we started with functional form where z is sum of two unknown function  So,
eliminating these two unknown function we are getting a partial differential equation
of second order 
phi dash  So, from this equation we want to obtain a partial differential equation, so
for that so take z equals to one by x phi plus phi dash  If you take first order derivative
origin of a second order equation that means how a second order partial differential equation
with respect to x of this equation, we obtain del z del x equals to minus one by x square
respect to y, so del z del y is equal one by x phi dash plus phi double dash 
And we take the second order derivative of z with respect to x to obtain the expression
which is written here  And we also need to take the second order derivative with respect
to y, del two z del y square equals to one by x phi double dash plus phi double dash 
So, from these four equations, del z del x, del z del y, del two z del x square, del two
del two z del x square minus del two z del y square equals to two z by x square 
So, taking this example we also see that, if z is sum of a function and its derivative,
can be generated from a solution  So, first take one example, let z is a function of x,
the partial differential equation corresponding this functional form is a second order partial
differential equation  Thus, in this module we have discussed the origin of a second order
partial differential equation, we have seen that if a function or the dependent variable
And we shall also take two examples, one from electric flows and one from electronics to
derive a second order differential equation for a physical problem  There are many examples
where these type of second order differential equation arise in practice  So, in this way
we end module one of chapter three 
v and u, v, w are functions of independent variables x and y 
of second order partial differential equation  The discussion with second order partial differential
In the entire discussion we are bounded to take the two independent variables  So, here
in in this discussion we have only two independent variables, which are denoted by x and y 
Let small p be del z del x and q is del z del y, small r is del two z del x square, s is
del two z del x del y and t is del two z del y square  These are the standard notation
which are used in in the theory of PDE 
So, let us first take derivative of equation one with respect to x, here z is our dependent
variable  So, if we take differentiate with respect to x then del z del x equals to f
of equation one with respect to y, so del z del y which is q is equals to f dash u uy plus
g dash v vy plus wy  Now, thus we obtain equations in three, taking derivative of equation
equation is important because second order partial differential equation arise in many
one once with respect to x and y 
Now, we take derivative of equations which are written in three with respect to x and
y again, so we take the first equation r which is del two z del x square which is obtained
by differentiating p with respect to x and the equation is written in equation number
four  So, if we take the derivative with respect to y of the equation p equals to f dash u
ux plus g dash v vx plus wx, we obtain the equation s equals to f double dash u ux uy
plus g double dash v vx vy plus f dash u uxy plus g dash v vxy plus wxy 
Now, if you take derivative with respect to y, the equation which is written as q is equal
to dot dot, we get the equation t equals to f double dash u uy square plus the terms
which are shown in equation number four  Thus we obtain five equations taking derivative of
problems in mathematical physics  These types of equations arise to describe wave motion,
equation one  Now, in these five equations the unknowns are the function f and g, so
we eliminate the derivative f dash g dash, f double dash and g double dash from these
five equation and we obtain the relation, the determinant which is written in equation number five 
Now, if we expand this determinant with respect to the first column, then we obtain a relation
in the form which is written in equation number six, capital R small r plus capital S small
s plus capital T small t plus capital P small p plus capital Q small q equals to W 
And these capital R, capital S, capital T, capital P, capital Q and capital W are functions of
independent variables x and y 
So, if we observe equation number six, we can see that from equation number one we obtain
equation number six which is a second order linear partial differential equation 
diffusion equation and electric flow, fluid flow, etcetera 
So, we can say that if we observe equation one there are two unknown functions f and g 
order which is written in equation number six 
So, let me take one example, let z is some function of f and g, where f and g are some
unknown function and f and g are function of x plus ay and x minus ay respectively 
Now, we want to form a partial differential equation from the equation seven, so for that
purpose we take derivative of equation seven twice with respect to x  So, we obtain the
relation r equals to f double dash plus g double dash 
And if we take derivative with respect to y of equation seven, we obtain the relation
t is equal to a square f double dash plus a square g double dash  And from these two
The entire chapter is divided into three modules, in first module I shall discuss about origin
equation if we eliminate f double dash and g double dash, we obtain a relation of the
form small t equals a square small r, which is a second order linear partial differential equation 
So, using this example we also see that if the original equation which is written in
equation number seven contain, if z is written as sum of two unknown function then from that
function one can obtain a second order partial differential equation  Now, this concept can
be generalized for n number of functions 
are some functions of x and y  So, from this equation, from this relation one can lead
to an nth order linear partial differential equation  In the last section we have discussed
the origin of a second order PDE that means how a second order PDE can be generated starting
of second order differential equation and we shall show that how a second order equation
from a solution and how they are linked with each other 
Now, I am going to discuss the application of, not application, how a second order differential
equation can come in some physical problem  I shall take two examples, one from electric
flows and another from electronics and how a second order equation can come to solve
this type of problem that I am going to discuss, so go to the slide show 
First I shall take one example from electric flow  For that we consider a one-dimensional
flow of electricity in a long insulated cable and i is the current, E is the corresponding
voltage  Since there is a one-dimensional flow so in spatial direction there is only
one coordinate which is denoted by x and we have another variable which is time t 
Thus for the fall of potential in a linear element of length delta x situated at the
can arise starting from a solution  In module two we shall discuss about the solution of
point x can be written, the equation can be written in this form minus delta E equals to
length and G is the conductance per unit length, then we have the another equation
Now, from the above two equation, we can obtain these two partial differential equations,
from the first equation dividing it by delta x and the second equation can be obtained
from the equation which is written here minus delta i equals to GE delta x plus C into del E del t
del x and dividing this equation by delta x  So, we obtained two equations with
a second order PDE with constant coefficients and we shall also discuss in module two, a
two unknowns E and i 
Now, we want to obtain the equation with one unknown variables, so for that we differentiate
equation nine with respect to x to obtain the equation which is written in equation
number eleven  And we obtain equation number twelve from equation ten taking derivative
with respect to t of the equation ten  Now, from the equation eleven and twelve if we
eliminate del i, the variable i that means from the equation eleven and twelve one can
eliminate del two i del x del t and del i del x can be eliminated from the equation ten 
So, from equation ten, eleven, twelve, eliminating the variable i we can obtain a relation which
is written in equation number thirteen del two E del x square equals to LC del two E
special type of <?>equa</?> with variable coefficient which is known as Cauchy-Euler form 
﻿Now, I am going to start module two of chapter  three  In this module, we shall find or we shall  
of beta r x minus alpha r y and this phi r  are the unknown functions since there are n  
reducible factors, so there are n unknown function  or arbitrary function and so the solution in the  
solution, the unknown functions are coming as  sum of this function which is written here   
Now, we are taking one example  to illustrate the previous idea  
so in this equation in this example the  equation is given D cube minus four D square D  
dash plus four D D square z equals to zero   So, capital F can be factorized in this way  
D into D minus two D dash whole square z equals  to zero  So, you can see that D minus two D dash  
is a double <?>dot</?>  So, we  need to use the concept which we  
have learned just now to find the solution  So, one solution the first one z equals to phi  
zero minus y this corresponds to the factor D and  there are two solutions or two unknown function  
which corresponds to D minus two D dash which is  sum, which is written here as sum over s x to the  
So, this is the general solution of the given  equation where the roots are repeated   
Till now, we have discussed how to find  complementary function when the operator or the  
irreducible form  So, for that case it may  not be possible to get a solution containing  
full number of arbitrary functions, but it  is possible to find solutions containing  
as many arbitrary constants as we desire  To illustrate this idea we shall take one example   
So, before going to the example we need to  explain one theorem which is stated there F  
in equation number one, where capital D is the  partial derivative with respect to x and D dash  
operated over e to the power a x plus b y is  equal to F of a b e to the power a x plus b y   
The proof of this theorem is very simple because  we know that if we operate a differential operator  
to an exponential function then the coefficient of  x will come instead of D and the coefficient of y  
that means b will come instead of D dash   
Now, using this theorem one can see that F  if the equation is given in the form capital  
F z equals to zero we can assume a solution  in the form e to the power a x plus b y   
So, if we apply this function instead of z we will  get according to this theorem capital F a b e to  
one can obtain a set of values for a  and b which satisfies this equation    
Let those set of values are ar, br  Now,  these are the solution of the given equation,  
so their linear combination that means sum of  cr exponential of arx plus bry is the solution  
ar, br satisfies the equation  F ar, br equals to zero   
So, in this example if you see  the first factor this is reducible  
because the first factor is a linear factor  but the second factor is not reducible  
that means that factor cannot be retained as the  product of two linear factors  So, for that case,  
we can assume the solution in the form  e to the power arx plus bry, where  
ar, br satisfies the relation ar square  plus br plus three equals to zero   
And for the reducible factor the solution is e  to the power minus five x phi of two x plus y   
c r s D to the power r D dash to the  power s where c r s are some constants   
Therefore, the required solution of the given  equation is z equals to the linear combinations  
of these functions  Here we have to note  that, there are infinite number of points  
which satisfies the relation ar square  plus br plus three equals to zero   
So, the summation, in the summation there  are infinite number of terms, there may be  
infinite number of terms in this summation but  this series should be uniformly convergent   
In the last section we have discussed about the  method of finding complementary function of a  
linear PDE with constant coefficients  Now, we are  going to discuss how to find particular integral  
of a nonhomogeneous PDE with constant coefficient   And we shall discuss some particular cases,  
we shall take the function, exponential function,  polynomial function, sine or cosine functions  
and the combination of these functions  Taking this type of function, we shall derive  
Now, we shall first discuss the general  solution of the equation capital F  
some rules for finding particular integrals   We shall also discuss when the equations  
are given in the form of Cauchy-Euler form  that means when the coefficients of the  
differential equations are not constants but  those coefficients are variables but those  
variables are in some particular form  To discuss  all this we need to go to the slide show   
Suppose we have an equation  capital F z equals to small f x,  
y, say particular integral can be considered  as an operator one by F operating on small f   
And we shall discuss to find particular  integral for some particular cases that means  
when small f is some particular functions   First we shall start taking small f  
to the power s, where r and s are positive  integers or zero and ars are constants   
D, D dash z equals to zero and the general  solution of the equation which is written  
So, if small f is given in this form  particular integral can be written  
The idea will be more clear  if we take one example    
So, we take this example, so in this example  small f function is x square plus xy plus y square  
and capital F is capital D plus D dash square  So,  it’s very easy to find the complementary function,  
so complementary function is written here,  since there is a repeated root we will get  
the complementary function in this form phi  one x minus y plus x into phi two x minus y   
Now, particular integral is one by capital  F D dash operator, so in this case it is one  
in equation number three is called the  complementary function of the equation one  
by D plus D dash square operating on  x square plus x y plus y square   
Now, here, we take the factor D square and  then the denominator becomes one plus D dash  
by D to the power two, so we need to operate  one plus D dash by D to the power minus one  
and we have to expand this series in binomial  So,  the binomial expansion of that operator becomes  
one minus two D dash by D plus three D  dash square by D square minus dot dot   
This binomial series contains infinite number  of terms, but since in small f, that means  
in the function x square plus xy plus y square,  the highest order of the polynomial is two,  
then it is sufficient to take the terms  up to D dash square by D square   
So, that’s why we took only the first  three terms in the expansion    
So, in the second line we write, we first operate one  on the function x square plus xy plus y square, so  
and any particular solution of equation  one is known as its particular integral   
it becomes x square plus xy plus y square and if  we operate the second term minus two D dash by D,  
this D dash is the differential  operator with respect to y 
So, if we differentiate x square plus xy plus y square  with respect to y, it becomes x plus two y   
And now if we operate the third operator three  D dash square by D square, that means D dash is  
the derivative with respect to y, so D dash square  represent derivative with respect to y twice  So,  
if we take second order derivative of x square  plus xy plus y square twice with respect to y, it  
becomes y  So, the terms becomes one by the second  line, its written in the second line, one by D  
square x square plus xy plus y square minus two by  D x plus two y plus three by D square into two   
Now, you have to remember that D represent  a differential operator with respect to x,  
therefore one by D represent the integration with  respect to x  So, one by D square is nothing but  
And there is an well known theorem which states  that if u be the complementary function and  
twice integration of the function x square plus xy  plus y square with respect to x, so this gives the  
term x to the power four by twelve plus x cube y  by six plus x square y square by two  Now, come to  
the second term two by D operating on x plus two  y that means you have to operate two by D cube  
on the term x plus two y, so it gives minus  two into x to the power four by twenty-four  
plus x cube y by three  And the last terms give the fourth  
so it gives x to the power four by twenty-four   So, after simplification it becomes one by four  
x to the power four minus two x  cube y plus two x square y square   
So, the required solution or the  general solution of the given equation  
is the complementary function plus particular  integral, so its z equals to phi one plus x phi  
z one be a particular integral  of the equation one then  
discuss about the methods for solving a second  order partial differential equation with constant coefficients 
two plus one by four x to the power four minus  two x cube y plus two x square y square    
Now, I am going to discuss the case when  small f y is in exponential form  So,  
the particular integral can be written as one  by F D operating on e to the power ax plus b y   
So, one by F D can be considered as the inverse  operator of the operator capital F  So, we know  
the property of exponential function, so using  that property we can write the particular integral  
as one by F a, b into e to the power ax plus b y,  provided capital F a, b is not equals to zero    
And the case when F a, b equals to zero,  we shall discuss that case separately   
Now, take this example, so in this example,  
we can see that it’s in the complementary  function its reducible to linear factor   
So, it’s easy to find the complementary function  which is linear combination of phi one, phi two,  
phi three, where phi one is function of y  minus x, phi two is function of y plus three x  
and phi three is function of y minus two x  So, particular integral is one by F D operating  
on e to the power two x plus y, so if  we use the rule which is written in b,  
we need to replace D by the coefficient of x  that means two and D dash by coefficient of y  
in this case it is one  So, it becomes one by  two plus one two minus three into two plus two  
into e to the power two x plus y, so minus  one by twelve e to the power two x plus y   
The general solution becomes z equals to phi one  plus phi two plus phi three minus one by twelve e  
to the power two x plus y  That is complementary  function plus particular integral   
Now, I am going to discuss the case when small  f is either a cosine function or sine function   
First of all, we shall discuss  when capital F is in the form  
of which is written here phi of D square D D  dash, D dash square  That means the function  
F is some function of D square D D dash or D  dash square, so for that case if we operate  
phi on the function cos ax plus b y, D square  will be replaced by minus a square and D D dash  
will be replaced by minus ab and D dash square  will be replaced by minus b dash square    
So, using this property one can find  particular integral in this form,  
so particular integral is one by F operating on  cos ax plus b y, so this equals to one by phi  
operating on cos ax plus b y, so that equals to  one by phi minus a square minus ab minus b square  
cos ax plus b y, provided phi minus a square minus  b square minus b square is not equals to zero   
The same rule is applicable when there is  sin function instead of cos function    
So, here is one example, the right  hand side is sin x into cos two x,  
so to apply the previous rule we need  to write this function as in this form,  
sin of x plus two y minus sin of x minus two y   So, complementary function is very easy to find,  
so complementary function becomes phi one y plus  phi two x plus y  And the particular integral  
So, according to previous rule we need to replace  D square by minus one square and D D dash by minus  
one into two, so that rule is applied here  And  for the second function we are using the same rule  
and getting the particular integral as half of sin  x plus two y plus one by six sin x minus two y   
Thus the required solution  becomes z equals to CF plus PI   
Now, I am going to discuss the case where capital  F a, b is equals to zero  So, if capital F a,  
b becomes zero then the earlier methods  will not be applicable, so for that case  
in the function capital F D D dash, there  will be a factor bD minus aD dash  So,  
we can take out that factor from F and the F  can be written as bD minus aD dash into some G  
which is function of D and D dash   And we also assume that G a, b is not equals to  
zero  Now, consider the differential equation bD  minus aD dash z equals to capital F ax plus b y   
Now, the corresponding subsidiary equation, this  is a first order partial differential equation, so  
we can write the corresponding Lagrange equation  which is written here dx by b equals to dy  
by minus a equals to dz by f of ax plus b y   Taking first two equation,  
one can obtain a solution as ax plus b y equals  to constant, let that constant is c  Now,  
taking the first and third equation and using  the relation ax plus b y equals to c, we get the  
equation dx by b equals to dz by f c and solving  this equation we get z equals to x by b into f c   
is also a solution of this equation  And this is called the super position principle   
Now, we replace c by the function ax plus b y  we get, z equals to x by b into f ax plus b y   
So, the particular integral for this equation  can be written as z equals to one by bD minus  
aD dash operating on f is equal  to x by b f ax plus b y    
Now, we shall use this concept to solve  the equation where F a, b equals to zero   
Now, think about the equation where F a, b equals  to zero, for that case particular integral is  
one by F operating on small f  Now, capital  F can be written as bD minus aD dash into  
capital G D D dash, since capital G a, b is not  equals to zero  After operating one by capital G  
D D dash on f ax plus b y, one can replace in  the function G D by a and D dash by b, so we  
obtain the expression one by G a, b into one  by bD minus aD dash operating on small f    
And now we need to apply the previous concept,  where we obtain the solution of bD minus aD dash  
So, for a linear equation one can  apply super position principle  
z equals to F, using that concept we can write  this expression as x by b into f ax plus b y   
So, the particular integral for this case  becomes x by bG a, b into f ax plus b y   
Now, think about the expression for capital  F which is bD minus aD dash into G, now if we  
differentiate the function F with respect  to D, we get F dash D D dash equals to bG  
plus bD minus aD dash into G dash  So, F dash a, b is equal to b into G a, b   
So, particular integral becomes x by F dash  a, b into f ax plus b y  So, here b into G  
is replaced by F dash, provided F  dash a, b is not equals to zero   
Now, we shall illustrate  that idea using this example   
So, this is a second order linear partial  differential equation with constant coefficient   
But, the right hand side is some function of  x plus two y, so in this case we can see that,  
so now we shall categorize a linear differential  operator F D, D dash into two classes,  
complementary function, since there is a  repeated root in capital F, so complementary  
function can be written in this way phi one  x plus two y plus x phi two x plus two y   
Now, the particular integral  it becomes one by F D square  
four D square minus four D D dash plus D dash  square operating on sixteen log x plus two y   
And just before we have learned that this becomes  zero, so a particular integral can be written as  
x by F dash a, b into small ax plus b y   So, we use that concept, so it becomes one  
divided by F dash, so it is F D minus four  D dash operating on log x plus two y   
Again the denominator vanishes for D equals to one  and D dash equals to two  So, its again becomes x  
divided by F dash, so in this case F function  is F D minus four D dash, so its derivative  
with respect to D is only eight  So, particular  integral is sixteen x square divided by eight  
one is the reducible and the another one  is the irreducible form  The function  
into log x plus two y  So, after simplification  it becomes two x square into log x plus two y   
Now, f may be combination of exponential function  and the another function so it can be written as  
e to the power ax plus b y into V  So, for that  case, particular integral can be written as one  
by capital F operating on e to the power ax plus  b y into V and e to the power ax plus b y can be  
taken out from the operator one by V, one by F and  in the function F D will be replaced by D plus A  
and D dash will be replaced by D dash b and that  will be operated on the function capital V   
Now, I want to discuss about a particular  form of a second order differential  
equation where the coefficients are not  constant but the variable coefficients   
But, these variable coefficients has some  particular form that means capital F,  
the function capital F can be written as function  of x into capital D and y into D dash  So,  
F is said to be reducible if it can be written  as the product of linear factors of the form  
if the capital F is in this particular form that  equation is known as Cauchy-Euler equation   
this equation can be transformed into  an equation with constant coefficient  
with some transformation in the independent  variables x and y  And the transformation is this  
x equals to e to the power u and y is equal to e  to the power v  So, if we write down the equation,  
the given equation in terms of the  variables u and v instead of x and y,  
the equation will become a differential  equation with constant coefficients   
And we know how to find the solution of  a equation with constant coefficients,  
so using those concepts one can solve this  particular type of equation or the Cauchy-Euler  
equation using this transformation  Thus, in module  two of chapter three we have learned how to find  
alpha D plus beta D dash plus gamma where alpha  beta and gamma are constants and capital F,  
In the entire discussion we shall  be confined on taking two independent variables  
complementary function of a partial differential  equation with constant coefficient   
And we have learned how to find particular  integral of that equation taking some  
particular functions such as exponential function,  polynomial function, sine and cosine function and  
the combination of these functions  We have also  discussed how to find solution of a equation  
the case b where capital F is called irreducible  if it cannot be factored into linear factors  
as it is done in class a  Now, I am taking here one example,  
where you can see one reducible factor  and another irreducible factors   
So, in this example, capital F is D cube minus  D square D dash minus two D D dash square   
plus D dash  So, in this factors you can see  that all the factors are linear factors   
square D dash into D dash plus one  plus D D dash minus D dash square  
minus D dash cube  If we factorize this F we  will get two factors which is written here D  
square plus D dash and D minus D dash minus D dash  square  If we observe these two factors, these two  
and this process or method can be extended  when there are nth order partial differential  
factors are not further reducible to linear  factors, so this F is called irreducible   
Now, I shall discuss the case where the  function F can be factored into reducible  
and we also assume that alpha r is  not equals to zero, then u r equals to  
exponential of minus gamma r by  alpha r x into phi r beta r x  
minus alpha r y is the solution of  the equation F z equals to zero   
But if, alpha r equals to zero then the theorem  is the next theorem which is stated here,  
for that case we are assuming that beta r is not  equals to zero  So, beta r D dash plus gamma r  
if this is a factor of F and phi r xi is an  arbitrary function of the single variable xi  
equation with constant coefficient  The entire module is divided into two section   
x  So, using these two theorems we can find  the solution of a homogeneous equation   
So we, to illustrate the idea  we are taking one example   
So, capital F the expression for capital F is  written here D cube plus three D dash minus four  
into D square plus three D dash square minus  eight D plus three D plus three minus four D  
dash plus D dash square into D dash z equals to  zero  So, if we observe the function capital F  
then we see that capital F can be factorized  which is given in the solution in this form  
D plus D dash minus one into D plus D dash minus  three into D plus D dash z equals to zero   
So, for this example F is  reducible to linear factors,  
so using the first theorem the one solution  is e to the power x into phi one y minus x  
In the first section, I shall discuss how to find  general solution of a homogeneous equation  Then  
and e to the power three x into phi two y minus  x and the third solution phi three y minus x   
Now, the linear combinations of these three  solutions will be the general solution of  
the given equation which is written here z  equals to the sum of these three functions   
Now, suppose that there is a linear factor of  F but that factor is repeated  So, let us take  
one example where the linear factor comes twice  and it is written in equation number four   
So, to solve this equation we assume another  function, another variable z as alpha r D  
plus beta r D dash plus gamma r into z so  if we assume the expression for capital Z  
like this the equation four reduces to the  form alpha r D plus beta r D dash plus gamma r  
operating on capital Z equals to zero  Now, Z  is our unknown function, so using the previous  
theorem we can find the expression for Z as  Z equals to exponential of minus gamma r by  
in the next section, I shall discuss how to  find particular integral of a nonhomogeneous  
Now, if we see what is our capital z,  this capital z we have assumed as alpha r  
equation alpha r del z del x plus beta r del z del  y plus gamma r z equals to some function of x and  
y which is written in the right side  Now, this  is a first order partial differential equation  
and we know how to find solution of  a first order differential equation   
We have learned that in chapter two  So, using that concept one can find the  
corresponding auxiliary equation or Lagrange  auxiliary equation is like that dx by alpha r  
equals to dy by beta r equals  to dz by which is written here   
Now, this simultaneous equation can be solved  easily  So, if we take first two equation,  
PDE with constant coefficient  So, let us  start the first slide of this module   
we can get a solution beta r x minus alpha r y  equals to constant  Let’s say that constant is  
c one and we can say there is one expression  beta r in the equation in the denominator  
of the last expression dz by some function  so where beta r x minus alpha r y is present  
so in that place one can replace that  function with the constant c one   
So, putting that value we obtain the relation  which is written here so taking the first equation  
and last equation of the simultaneous equation  that means dx by alpha r equals to dz by minus  
gamma r z plus exponential of minus  gamma r by alpha r x into phi r c one   
Since, c one is a constant  This is a ordinary  first order linear differential equation  So,  
one can solve this linear differential equation  easily and the solution is written here z equals  
to one by alpha r phi r c one x plus c two into  exponential of minus gamma r by alpha r into x   
As I have told, in this module I shall  discuss about the solution of a linear partial  
Now, to find the solution of  the original equation we need to  
replace c one by the function beta r x minus  alpha r y, so replacing c one and also the c two  
the expression for c two we can  obtain the function z equals to x  
phi r beta r x minus alpha r y plus <?>psi  r</?> beta r x minus alpha r y into exponential  
of minus gamma r by alpha r into x, where  phi r and psi r are the arbitrary function   
So, this idea can be generalized when there are  n repeated roots in the function capital F   
So, that theorem is stated now if alpha r D  plus beta r D dash plus gamma r to the power  
then a solution of the equation F z equals  to zero is z equals to exponential of minus  
gamma r by alpha r x into sum of  x to the power s minus one phi r s  
differential equation with constant coefficient   The general form of linear PDE with constant  
Now, I am going to start module three of chapter three  In module two, we have discussed with
And the calculation is shown in the slide 
Therefore, our equation becomes B equals to this which is written here, x square plus
eta eta x minus x into zeta Xi Xi y plus zeta eta eta y, minus two into x square minus y
these values in the transformed coordinate system, the equation becomes zeta Xi eta equals
to eta square minus one divided by eta square plus one whole square 
So, the complete integral, so this is the canonical form and this is of second order
partial differential equation with constant coefficient, so, we can solve it easily  So, its
method or Green’s function method to find solution of a linear hyperbolic partial differential equation 
general solution is complementary function plus particular integral  So, the general
square plus one  So, if we come back to our coordinate system x, y, z, the solution becomes
discuss about the parabolic case where S square minus four RT equals to zero 
So, let us start from the quadratic equation R lambda square plus S lambda equals to zero 
Since this is the parabolic equation, this quadratic equation has two equal roots, let
equals to constant is a solution of the equation dy dx plus lambda x, y equals to zero 
Now, A zeta x, Xi x, Xi y equals to zero, and A square minus four RT equals to zero 
So, let us go to the first slide of this module  The general form of a linear second order
So, from equation six, we have B equals to zero, but A eta x, eta y cannot be zero 
Otherwise, J will become zero, so we cannot choose eta and Xi as two independent coordinates 
Thus, the equation four reduces to the form, zeta eta eta equals to some function psi of
Xi, eta, zeta, zeta Xi, zeta eta, which is written in equation number twelve  So, this
is the canonical form of a parabolic partial differential equation, and it can be solved
easily because its coefficients are constant  Now, we shall take one example to illustrate
So, in this case capital R is x square, capital S is minus two x y, capital T is y square,
so, S square minus four RT equals to zero  Now, consider R lambda square plus S lambda
plus T equals to zero, so, substituting the values R, S, T we get the quadratic equation
partial differential equation can be written in this form, which is given in equation number
which is written here  So, the roots of this equation is lambda equals to y by x, y by
x, so this is repeated row  So, the the solution can be obtained from the equation dy dx plus
y by x equals to zero  And if we solve this equation, we get one integral as xy equals to constant 
provided the Jacobian of Xi and eta is not equals to zero, so, we take in this case eta
as y by x  So, our transformation is Xi is equal to x y and eta is equal to y by x 
So, using this transformation we can calculate the value of A as zero, and value of A Xi
x, Xi y is zero  But, value of A eta x, eta y is not equals to zero, its value is four
into y square by x square  The detailed calculation can be seen in the slide and the value of
B is written here 
one  Capital R small r plus capital S small s plus capital T small t plus small f which
value of capital F which is minus eight into zeta eta minus one into y by x  Substituting
x y plus x by y f two x y plus x by y, so it can be written in some different form
like this, f one x y plus x square by x y into f two x y plus y by x 
So, it can be written as z equals to Phi one x, y plus x square Phi two x y plus y by x,
the elliptic case where S square minus four RT is less than zero  So, for this case the
quadratic equation R lambda square plus S lambda plus T equals to zero has complex roots 
Let those two roots are Xi equals to alpha plus i beta and eta equals to alpha minus
i beta  To get the normal form for this case we need another transformation from Xi eta
to alpha, beta 
So, let’s take alpha equals to half of Xi plus eta, and beta is equal to half of eta
plus Xi  This transformation is required because Xi and eta they are not real quantity, but
we want to get the equation in real variables  But, if we do this transformation, alpha and
beta becomes real  Now, we want to write the equation in terms of the real variables, alpha
partial derivative of capital Z with respect to x twice  That means small r is del two
zeta del Xi del eta is one by four del two zeta del alpha square plus del two zeta del
beta square 
And the value of A Xi x, Xi y it becomes zero, and value of A eta x, eta y this is also zero 
But, the value of B square it becomes negative, so the equation four deduces to the form,
del two zeta del alpha square plus del two zeta del beta square equals to Chi which is
function of alpha, beta, zeta, zeta alpha, zeta beta  So, equation thirteen is the canonical
form or the normal form of an elliptical partial differential equation  Now, we are discussing
one example which is elliptical, so in this example, the values of R is one, S is two,
capital T is four and small f is two p plus three q 
And if we compute S square minus four RT, its value is less than zero  And the quadratic
equation R lambda square plus S lambda plus four equals to zero, it has two complex roots,
minus one plus minus i into root three  So, the characteristic equations are dy dx plus
minus one plus i into root three, that means this is lambda one equals to zero and dy dx
plus lambda two equals to zero  So, it has solution, y plus lambda one x equals to constant,
and y plus lambda two x equals to constant  So, we we can choose Xi as y minus x plus
i into root three x and our eta as y minus x minus i into root three x 
Now, to get the equation in terms of some real variables we do this substitution,
alpha equals to half of Xi plus eta and beta equals to i by two eta minus Xi  So, this gives alpha
as y minus x, and beta as root three x  So, in terms of alpha and beta the expression
for A becomes zero, and the value of A eta x, eta y, this is zero, zeta x, zeta y this
and small p is del z del x and small q is del z del y 
is also zero  And the value of capital B after simplification becomes zero, and the value
of capital F which is minus zeta minus two root three zeta beta 
So, the equation becomes zeta Xi eta equals to one by four del two zeta del alpha square
of the given equation becomes zeta alpha alpha plus zeta beta beta equals to minus one by
three zeta alpha plus two root three zeta beta  Now, I am going to discuss very powerful
method known as Riemann’s method or the method of Green’s function to find solution
of a linear hyperbolic partial differential equation 
This method is very useful to find solution of a one-dimensional wave equation, so, to
explain that method we need to go to the slide show  Suppose, we have a linear hyperbolic
partial differential equation which are in normal form and the equation is written in
equation number one, del two z del x del y plus a del z del x plus b del z del y plus cz
equals to f  So, in compact form, we can write that L z is equal to f, where L is the
operator, del two del x del y plus a del del x plus b del del y plus c 
Let w be an arbitrary function of x and y such that its first order derivatives are continuous 
So, for that function w we can compute this, w del two z del x del y minus
z del two w del x del y as del del y of w del z del x minus del del x of z del w del
y  And w a del z del x plus z del del x of a w is equal to del del x of awz, and similarly,
capital L is equivalent to capital R del two del x square plus capital S del two del x
a partial differential equation, linear with constant coefficients, and we have also discussed
a w minus del del y of b w plus c w 
And the function U is of the form, awz minus z del w del y, and V is equal to bwz plus
w del z del y  The relation which is written in equation number two is called Lagrange
identity, and the operator L star which is defined in equation number three is called
be an arbitrary point in this plane, and sigma be the area enclosed by the contour ABPA 
You see the diagram, then it will be clear 
sigma del U del x plus del V del y  Because these two quantities are same these equals
to integration of Udy minus Vdx using Green's theorem  So, using Green's theorem this surface
So, it can be seen in the figure ABPA, so this is our closed contour small c  So,
now this contour can be decomposed into three parts 
the contour c into three parts A to B, Udy minus Vdx plus B to P  If you see the line
B to P, here there is no any change of x, so dx equals to zero along BP  So, here the
dx part is zero, only Udy is present and along the curve P to A there is no any change of
y, so, dy is zero  So, here P to A Vdx part is there 
y  And we also assume that these functions possesses continuous partial derivatives of
V, we get bwz plus w del z del x dx  So, it can, with some manipulation we can write in
equals to, which is written in the last line of this slide, P to A z into bw minus del
A Vdx 
minus the expression which is written here, and this can be obtained using relation five 
So, using relation five we are substituting the value of P to A Vdx  So, after that substitution
discussion, you can notice that the function w is arbitrary  We didn’t assume any form
of w, so now we want to choose w in such a way that it satisfies these four conditions 
So, w is such that L star w equals to zero throughout the xy-plane and del w del x equals
to bw when y equals to eta 
And del w del y equals to aw when x equals to Xi and w equals to one when x equals to
Xi, y equals to eta  The function w which satisfies these four conditions is called
the Green's function  The function which satisfies this condition is called Green's function
or Riemann-Green’s function of L z equals to f x, y  So, value of z at the point P can
be written with the expression which is written in equation number seven  So, the vale of
z at any point can be obtained if z and del z del x are prescribed on sigma  Again, we
know the relation zw at B minus zw at A equals to integration A to B del del x of zw dx plus
del del y of zw dy 
So, if we use this relation, we can obtain another value of z at P, which is written
in equation number eight  Therefore, z at P can be also obtained if the values of z
written in equation number nine  So, we can see that if the values of z del z del x and
hyperbolic equation  So, take this example and it is given that the Green's function for this
square minus four RT is greater than zero and it is called parabolic if S square minus
equation w is x plus y into two xy plus Xi minus eta into x minus y plus two
Xi eta, divided by Xi plus eta whole cube  So, we have to find the solution of this the
given differential equation which satisfies the condition z equals to zero, del z del
x equals to three x square on y is equal to x 
adjoining operator to L, L star can be written this which is shown here 
Now, this L star, now the Green's function for this example, for this equation will satisfy
this four conditions, L star w equals to zero throughout the xy-plane  Del w del x equals
to two by x plus y into w on y is equal to eta, and del w del y equals to two by x plus
y into w on x equals to Xi, and w equals to one at Xi, eta  So, these four conditions
four RT equals to zero 
are satisfied by our supplied Green's function w 
And from this function, one can calculate del w del x, del w del y, del two w del x
del y, and we can also calculate w L minus z L star equals to del U del x plus del V
del y  So, U becomes two zw by x plus y minus z into del w del y, and V is two zw by x plus
twelve by Xi plus eta cube, integration Xi to eta is to the power five plus x cube Xi eta dx 
So, z at Xi eta becomes after simplification Xi minus eta into two Xi square minus Xi eta
plus two eta square, so, Xi z x, y equals to x minus y into two x square minus xy plus
two y square  So, in this way we can find solution of a linear hyperbolic differential
And it is called elliptic if S square minus four RT is less than zero at any point x zero,
equation using Green's function  Thus, in module three of chapter three, we have discussed
about canonical form of a second order partial differential equation taking two independent
variables  We have also discussed the powerful method or Green's function method to find
solution of a linear hyperbolic differential equation  In this way, we end module three
of chapter three 
So, let us take that transformation as Xi and eta  So, Xi is some function of x and
y, and eta is also some function of x and y  And we also assume that Xi and eta they are
with the equation with variable coefficients when the equation is given in Cauchy-Euler form 
continuously differentiable, and one important assumption is the Jacobian of this transformation
J equals to del Xi, eta by del x, y, which can be written in determinant form as Xi x,
So, one of the basic assumption in this transformation is the Jacobian of this transformation is
not equals to zero  If Jacobian of this transformation becomes zero then we cannot choose Xi and
eta as our independent variables; they will become dependent  Now, we want to write the
given equation in terms of the new independent variables Xi and eta  And we are writing the
dependent variable zeta in the transformed space instead of z  So, small p which is del
del eta del x 
In this module, we shall discuss with a linear second order partial differential
Also, q can be written as zeta Xi into Xi y plus zeta eta
Also, we can see the variable t which is del two z del y square, it can also be
these values in the original equation, that means in equation number one, then equation
one is transformed into the form which is written in equation number four, which is
capital A into zeta of Xi Xi plus two B zeta of Xi eta 
equation with variable coefficients and we shall show that with some suitable transformation
And the function B is defined as which is written in equation number five, R u one u
two plus half S u one v two plus u two v one plus T v one v two  And the function capital F
we get the coefficient of the second order derivatives are related by a relation which
is written in equation number six 
B square minus A square is equal to S square minus four RT into J square  This J is the
Jacobian of the transformation, which is given in equation number three  Now, I shall discuss
three cases separately  First, I am taking the case hyperbolic case, that means when
capital S square minus four RT is greater than zero  So, in this case, we think about
the equation R lambda square plus S lambda plus T equals to zero  Since, S square minus
of the independent variables any second order linear partial differential equation can be
four RT is greater than zero, this quadratic equation the quadratic equation in lambda
has two real and distinct roots 
Let those roots are lambda one and lambda two  Now, we choose Xi and eta such that Xi
x equals to lambda one into Xi y and Eta x equals to lambda two into eta y  Now,
Think about the equation Xi x minus lambda one Xi y equals to zero  Now, the corresponding auxiliary
equation this is a first order partial differential equation  So, the corresponding auxiliary
equation is dx by one equals to dy by minus lambda one equals to d Xi by zero  So, solving
this equation we get d Xi equals to zero or Xi equals to constant 
And the another taking other two variables dx by one equals to dy by minus lambda one,
from this equation we get another equation dy dx plus lambda one, which is function of
transformed into some normal form, and this form is known as canonical form 
we get a solution eta x y equals to constant  And we get another equation dy dx plus lambda
two x, y equals to zero, which is written in equation number eight  So, from these two
constant, and solving eight we get another integral f two x, y equals to zero 
zero which is shown in the slide and A eta x, eta y, in the similar way we can show that
Xi x, Xi y zero, A eta x, eta y equals to zero  So, it becomes B square equals to A
And this canonical form is useful to categorize any second order linear differential equation 
square minus four RT into J square  So, since A square minus four RT is greater than zero
we get B square is greater than zero 
zeta eta  And this is our required canonical form for the hyperbolic partial differential
differential equation this is the canonical form or the standard form  Now, we shall take
one example  So, this is our given equation which is a second order linear differential equation 
Now, for this equation capital R is x y, S is minus x square minus y square,
capital T is minus x y 
So, A square minus four RT, it can be calculated which is a positive quantity, so, this is
There are three types of canonical forms, they are parabolic, elliptical and hyperbolic 
a hyperbolic type equation  Now, think about the quadratic equation R lambda square plus
S lambda plus T equals to zero  So, substituting the values of R, S, T, it becomes the equation
which is shown here  So, from this equation the two roots, lambda one and lambda two are
x by y and minus y by x  So, our one equation is dy dx plus x by y equals to zero, so it
gives one constant, x square plus y square equals to constant 
And the another equation, dy dx minus y by x equals to zero, it gives another integral
x by y is equal to constant  So, we can choose the transformation, Xi is equal to x square
yy  Now, substituting these values we can compute the value of A Xi x, Xi y and its
Apart from canonical form I shall discuss a very powerful method which is known as Riemann’s
﻿Now, I am going to start chapter four   
equal to grad square psi one minus grad square  psi two  So, its value equals to zero in V, and  
So, that equals to g minus V that means  equals to zero on S  Now, if we recall  
property number one, from that property we  can say that the solution of the equation,  
That means psi one is equal to  psi two on the domain V as well as  
Now, this is property number four,  
And I shall also discuss how to derive Laplace  equation in different coordinate system   
it’s regarding Neumann problem  It says that  if the Neumann problem for a bounded region  
has a solution, then it is either unique  or differs from one another by a constant   
So, proof is given here, if possible we  assume that there are two distinct solutions,  
and del psi one del n equals to some known  function h on S  And psi two will satisfy  
grad square psi two equals to zero in V,  and del psi two del n equals to h on S   
In the similar manner, we assume a function psi  which is difference of the above two functions,  
psi one and psi two  So, psi equals to psi one  minus psi two, and if we see grad square psi  
Now, I am going to the first slide of module one   The Laplace equation with n independent variables  
one del n minus del psi two del n  So, that  is equals to h minus h equals to zero on S   
If the constant is zero then  psi is psi one is unique,  
that means psi one is equal to psi two  in V  So, this proves this property   
So, for this case psi the solution may be unique  or they may differ from one another by a constant   
Now, I am going to define spherical mean   
Let V be a bounded region enclosed by a  closed surface S and P be a point within V   
So, figure is given here, so p is a  point which has coordinates x, y, z   
And around p we are drawing a sphere of radius  small r, and the surface of the sphere is denoted  
can be written as grad square psi equals to zero,  where the domain of the function is the set omega  
one divided by four pie r  square surface integral of psi  
d sigma  That means we are taking the  integral over the surface of the sphere sigma,  
and Q is any variable point on  the surface of the sphere sigma   
And d sigma is the element of surface  So, this is nothing but average of the value  
be a sphere with center at P and radius r such  that sigma lies entirely within the domain  Then  
which is subset of R n  The equation is written in equation number one  
Now, there is one important theorem which is known  as maximum-minimum principles and these principles  
can be proved using the property of harmonic  function  First, I shall state the theorem  
and then I shall prove this theorem   So, this theorem states that if  
psi be a continuous function in V plus  S and it is harmonic in the region V,  
which is bounded by the closed surface S and we  also assume that psi is not constant everywhere  
on V plus S  Then the maximum and minimum  values of psi must occur on the boundary   
Proof - If possible we assume that psi attains  its maximum value M at some interior point P of  
some of the values of psi on sigma must be less  than M  This is the property of having maximum  
and the Poisson equation is written  as grad square psi equals to f,  
its spherical average is less than capital M   So, it contradicts the fact that it will have the  
same value as it is at the point P, hence psi  must be constant over the entire sphere sigma   
Now, suppose Q be another point in the domain  capital V, now we connect the point Q with the  
with spheres and using Heine-Borel theorem for  choosing a finite number of covering spheres  
we conclude by considering the above argument that  psi has the same constant value at Q as at P   
Hence, it is impossible for psi to attain  its maximum value at any point inside V  So,  
it implies that psi must attain its maximum  value at some point on the boundary S of V   
So, similar argument shows that  psi attains its minimum value on S   
So, in this theorem, we learnt that maximum  or minimum value of the function psi  
is attained only on the  boundary S of the domain V   
Now, there is another important theorem  which is called stability theorem,  
which says that the solution of Dirichlet problem  depends continuously on the boundary values   
Proof - Let psi one, psi two be two  solutions of the Dirichlet problem  
satisfying the equation, grad square  psi one equals to zero together with  
the boundary condition psi one equals to g one  on the boundary S, and the another solution  
psi two will satisfy the Laplace equation, grad  square psi two equals to zero  And it will also  
satisfy the boundary condition psi two equals to  g two on the boundary S of the region capital V   
del square is defined as del two del x one square  plus del two del x two square plus del two del  
Now, we construct a function psi which  is equals to psi one minus psi two  Now,  
if we think about the equation satisfied by the  function psi is grad square psi is equal to zero  
in the region V and psi equals to  g one minus g two on the boundary S  
S is the boundary  Hence, at any point within V,  
we have for any given epsilon greater than  zero minus epsilon less than psi minimum  
is less than equals to psi less than equals to  psi maximum, which is less than epsilon 
That is  mod of psi is less than epsilon  if the difference of the psi  
max minus psi mean is less than epsilon   Or in other words, we can say that if  
g one minus g two mod is less than  epsilon on S, then mod of psi one  
boundary condition which is in this case mod of  g one minus g two, so, in this way we prove this  
theorem  The solution of Dirichlet problem  depends continuously on the boundary values   
It is sometimes required to find solution  of Laplace equation in different geometries   
In this section, we shall derive the expression of  Laplace equation in different coordinate systems  
like polar coordinate system, spherical  and cylindrical coordinate system   
So, for derivation we need to go to the slide  show  Now, I am going to derive Laplace equation  
in plane polar coordinates  In polar coordinates  system, there are two independent variables,  
r and theta  So, here we are trying to write the  Laplacian operator grad square in terms of the  
independent variable r and theta, the derivation  is shown here  The corresponding transformation  
because the Cauchy problem for Laplace equation  in a bounded domain V is over determined   
is x equals to r cos theta and y is equal to  r sin theta  So, from this transformation we  
can derive that r square equals to x square plus y  square, and theta equals to tan inverse y by x   
The Laplace equation in Cartesian coordinate is  written in equation number five, psi xx plus psi  
yy equals to zero  Now, to write that equation  in terms of r and theta we have to compute psi x,  
so, psi x equals to psi r rx plus psi theta,  theta x  Here, we have used chain rule,  
so that is equals to psi r into the value of rx  is cos theta minus psi theta into sin theta by r   
Here we have put the value of theta x as sin theta  by r  Similarly, we can derive the value of psi  
y using chain rule psi equals to psi y is  equals to psi r ry plus psi theta, theta y   
So, this equals to psi r into sin theta  plus psi theta into cos theta by r   
So, here we have used the value of ry and theta y  
We cannot specify both psi and its  normal derivative, del psi del n  
This chapter is devoted to the  elliptical partial differential equation   
which are given here  So, if you take the second  order derivative of psi x with respect to x,  
in the similar way we can find an expression for  psi xx  And in the similar way if we take the  
second order derivative of psi with respect  to y, that means if we compute psi yy  
in terms of the derivative of psi with respect  to r and theta and if we substitute those values  
in equation number five, we will get  an equation which is written here  Psi  
rr plus one by r square psi theta theta  plus one by r psi r equals to zero   
The derivation is not shown  here  If anyone is interested,  
they can go through the E-text of this  module  The detailed calculations are there,  
so we get equation number six  This is the  Laplace equation in plane polar coordinates,  
now this is the derivation of Laplace  equation in cylindrical coordinates   
on the surface S of the  bounded domain capital V   
In cylindrical coordinates, there are  three independent variables r, theta and z   
independent variables r, theta and z  And this is the relation between Cartesian  
coordinate and the cylindrical coordinates is x  equals to r cos theta, y is equal to r sin theta  
and z is equal to z  So, using this transformation  one can transform the equation seven  
to equation nine  The detailed  calculation can be found in E-text,  
this is the last one  Here, we have derived  Laplace equation in spherical polar coordinates,  
and the corresponding transformation is x equals  to r sin theta cos Phi, y is equal to r sin theta  
sin Phi and z equals to r cos theta  So, using this transformation  
we can derive the expression for Laplace  equation which is written in equation number ten   
Thus in module one of chapter four, we have  discussed about different type of boundary value  
problems, namely Neumann problem, Dirichlet  problems, Robin problems etcetera  We have  
discussed about harmonic functions and its  properties, and we have also discussed about  
maximum-minimum principle and its consequences   And lastly, we have derived the expression for  
Laplacian operator in different coordinate  systems  In this way, we end this module 
Now according to the boundary condition, we can  categorize the problem into four categories   
Now according to boundary condition,  
we can divide the problems into four categories,  so, now I am going to discuss about Dirichlet  
on the boundary S of a bounded region capital  V  Then the problem is to determine a function  
psi, which is function of three independent  variables, x, y, z satisfying the equation  
I shall take Laplace equation and Poisson equation  for this discussion because these equations come  
On the other hand, we can define an exterior  Dirichlet problem  In exterior Dirichlet problem,  
the function psi will satisfy grad square  psi equals to zero outside the region V,  
where capital V is a finite simply connected  region and on the boundary of V that is  
Now, I am going to discuss about Neumann problem   So, in Neumann problem, the function psi will  
satisfy the equation, the Laplace equation,  grad square psi equals to zero within V 
If it is an interior Neumann problem and its normal  derivative del psi del n equals to some function h  
at every point on the boundary of V  that is on S  Similarly, we can define  
exterior Neumann problem  For exterior Neumann problem,  
in many fields of mathematical physics  like electrostatics, magnetostatics,  
psi will satisfy the equation, grad square psi  equals to zero outside some region capital V  
and on the boundary of capital V, the normal  derivative of psi, that means del psi del n  
is equals to some known function capital  H  So, any kind of Neumann problem, it may  
be an interior problem or exterior problem,  is called a second boundary value problem   
Now, I shall tell about Churchill  problem  In interior Churchill problem,  
we want to find the value of the unknown  function psi, which satisfies the equation,  
grad square psi equals to zero within  some bounded domain capital V   
And on the boundary, that means on S  del psi del n plus g psi equals to f,  
So, in case of Churchill problem, the boundary  condition is different from the previous cases   
surface waves in fluids and motion of gravitation,  motion of particle in gravitation etcetera   
When the boundary is given in this form,  that means on the boundary, the function,  
the sum of the function psi and its normal  derivative is defined then it is called  
Churchill problem  In the similar way,  we can define exterior Churchill problem,  
and Churchill problem is also called  a third boundary value problem   
Now, I am going to discuss about Robin problem   
For interior Robin problem, we mean we  have to find an unknown function psi,  
which satisfies the equation, grad square psi  equals to zero, within a finite domain capital V  
and on the boundary of capital V, that means  on S psi is equal to f one on S one and del  
psi del n equals to f two on S two, where S is  the union of two boundaries S one and S two   
In the similar manner, we can  define exterior Robin problem   
And I shall show that there is an important  role of boundary condition in the solution of  
Robin problem is also referred to a mixed boundary  value problem or fourth boundary value problem   
It is to be noted that the boundary value problem  
associated with Poisson’s equation  can be formulated in a similar way   
In this section, we are going to discuss  about harmonic function and its properties   
in case of three independent variables,  the equation is del two psi by del x square  
plus del two psi del y square plus del two psi  del z square equals to zero  A function psi is  
said to be harmonic in a closed region R if it is  harmonic at all interior point of that region   
So, in this section, we shall discuss harmonic  functions and its properties  Apart from that,  
Poisson’s equation and Laplace equation  So, it is important to discuss about the  
I shall discuss the mean value  theorem on harmonic function,  
and lastly, I shall discuss about maximum-minimum  principle and its consequences 
So, for the discussion we have to go to slide show,  I have already defined the harmonic function   
Now, I am going to discuss some  properties of harmonic function   
The first property it’s written here, if a  harmonic function vanishes everywhere on the  
boundary of a domain, then it is identically  zero everywhere  Proof is also given here   
the value of psi equals to zero on the  boundary S of V  Now using Green’s identity  
boundary condition together with the solution  of a Laplace equation, thus, the entire chapter  
Now, we have to note that grad square psi equals  to zero in the domain capital V, and psi equals  
to zero on S  So, if we use the condition grad  square psi equals to zero in V, the first integral  
in the left hand side is equals to zero  Now, using the condition psi equals to zero  
and grad psi is also a real quantity, so this  implies that grad psi must be equals to zero   
So, psi must be equals to zero in  V using the continuity condition,  
so this property is proved here   
is divided into three modules  In module one, I  shall discuss about different boundary conditions,  
Similarly, we can prove the another  property, this is property number two   
in the domain V  This property can be  proved in the similar way as we have done  
Dirichlet problem for a bounded region  has a solution, then it is unique   
I shall prove this property here,  so if possible let there are  
two different solutions, psi one and psi  two for the interior Dirichlet problem   
That means psi one will satisfy the Laplace  equation, grad square psi one equals to zero in V  
and psi one equals to some known function g on the  boundary S  And there is another solution psi two,  
which will satisfy the Laplace equation,  grad square psi two equals to zero in V  
apart from that I shall discuss about  harmonic function and its application   
﻿We know that Laplace equation comes in the  problem of potential theory  In some problems  
Now, I am going to discuss about the solution of  a Neumann problem  Neumann problem means we have  
to solve the Laplace equation together with the  boundary condition  And in the boundary condition  
instead of the unknown function Phi the  normal derivative of the unknown function Phi,  
psi are prescribed on the boundaries   So, the corresponding problem is written here,  
so you have to solve del two psi del X square  plus del two psi del Y square equals to zero  
at any interior point of the rectangle zero  less than equals to X less than equals to a,  
zero less than equals to y less than equals to b,  subject to the boundary condition del psi del X  
In Cartesian coordinates the Laplace equation is  given in equation number one  Now, we are going  
at the point zero y equals to del psi  del X at a y equals to del psi del y  
at the point X zero equals to zero and del  psi del y at the point x b equals to f x   
Here, we also assumed that the Fourier  cosine series expansion of small f x exist   
So, in this case we are considering  Neumann problem in a rectangle    
Now, I am going to tell about the solution  of that problem  We have already seen that  
if solution four and five are not acceptable  for rectangular boundaries  So, we have to  
take solution six which is given here psi  equals to C one cos p x plus C two sin p x  
into C three e to the power p y plus  C four e to the power minus p y   
Now, if we use the boundary condition  del psi del x at zero y equals to zero,  
then it gives that C two equals to zero  and del psi del x at a y equals to zero  
to solve equation one using the useful technique  known as method of separation of variables   
because sin of n pi equals to zero for  all n equals to zero one two dot, dot    
And if we use the boundary condition  del psi del y at x zero equals to zero   
These gives C four equals to C three, hence the  solution satisfying the above boundary conditions  
Now, the only boundary condition we need to  apply is del psi del y at x b equals to a f x   
can be obtained using the orthogonality property  of the cosine series  So, to get the constants A n  
we need to multiply f x with cos n pi x by a and  then we need to integrate over zero to a    
In that method we assume the function  psi as product of two function capital  
Thus, the solution of the interior Neumann problem  is given by psi equals to A naught plus sum  
n equals to one to infinity A n cos n  pi x by a sin hyperbolic n pi y by a,  
where A zero is arbitrary constant and  A n is given which is written here   
Now, I am going to discuss about solution  of Laplace equation in polar coordinate  
system  The Laplace equation in polar coordinate  system, which we have derived in module one  
of this chapter is written in equation number  eleven  Here we are using the same techniques,  
the method of separation of variables  So, psi  is written as product of two function capital R  
and theta, which are functions of small  r and small theta respectively   
So, substituting this expression for psi  in eleven we can separate the equations  
for capital R and capital theta, which  is written in equation number twelve   
Now, let k is the separation constant,  so the equations for capital R becomes  
r square, d two capital R d r square plus small r  d R d r minus p square capital R equals to zero   
And if you see this equation this  is an ordinary differential equation  
and it is given in Cauchy Euler form  So, with some transformation that means if we  
substitute R is equal to e to the power u  So, in  terms of the independent variable u that equation  
can be transformed into an ordinary differential  equation with constant coefficients and that can  
the power p plus C two r to the power minus p   And the equation for theta is d two theta d theta  
So, assuming the solution in the  form which is written in two,  
square plus p squared theta equals to zero  And we  can find its solution easily as theta is equal to  
combination of sine function and cosine  function which is written here 
So, the solution psi becomes C one r to the power p  plus C two r to the power minus p into C three  
cos p theta plus C four sin p theta  So, in case  one we have taken k as a positive constant   
Now, for the second case we are assuming k as  zero  So, in similar way we can prove that the  
expression for capital R is C five log r plus  C six and theta is C seven theta plus C eight   
And psi consequently psi becomes C five log r  plus C six into C seven theta plus C eight   
Now, for the case when k is less than zero, the  solution becomes which is written in equation  
number fifteen  So, for polar coordinates the  solutions can be written in three different forms,  
which are retained in equation number thirteen,  equation number fourteen and equation number  
if we substitute this expression in equation  one, equation one can be written in the form,  
fifteen  And all these expressions the C j,  j equals to one to twelve are constants   
Now, we are taking a boundary value problem  specifically interior Dirichlet problem  
for a circle  The interior Dirichlet  problem for a circle is defined as follows,  
we have to find the value of the single valued  function which is continuous  That function is psi  
and which satisfies the Laplace equation and on  the circular region that means on r equals to a  
psi satisfies some boundary condition which  is written here, psi a theta equals to f theta  
for zero less than equals to  theta less than equals to two pi   
And f theta is a continuous function of theta   
Since psi is a single valued function,  
it will satisfy the periodicity condition  that means psi r theta plus two pi  
which is written in equation number  three  That means, one by capital X  
must be equals to psi r theta, for zero less  than equals to theta less than equals to two pi   
Now, we note that r equals to zero is a point  of the domain of definition of the problem  
and we know that log r is  undefined at r equals to zero   
So, if you see the solution, the solution in polar  coordinates can be written in three different  
forms, we have already derived that   So, if you look at those forms,  
so if we look at the form which  is written in equation fourteen,  
this solution is undefined at r equals  to zero  So, solution which is written in  
equation number fourteen is not acceptable   And if we look at the solution which is  
written in equation fifteen here is also the  solution is undefined at r equals to zero   
So, the solution fourteen and  fifteen are not acceptable   
So, the only solution we can think about  which is retained in equation number thirteen   
So, starting from equation number from the  solution which is written in equation number  
thirteen, we need to apply the boundary  condition and the periodicity condition   
So, if we apply the periodicity condition in  equation sixteen it gives C three cos p theta  
equals to C four psi plus C four sin P theta  is equal to C three cos p two pi plus theta  
plus C four sin p two pi plus theta  So, after  simplification we get the values of p is equals  
to n, where n is zero, one two, three, that  means all positive integer values and zero   
Now, using the principle of superposition the  solutions psi can be written as sum over n C n  
r to the power n plus D n r to the power minus  n into A n cos n theta plus B n sin n theta   
Again you can see that psi r theta  is finite at r equals to zero   
let’s say a constant k, where k is  called the separation constant   
So, it is possible only when D n equals to  zero  So, substituting D n equals to zero and  
defining the constants in this way which is  written here  We get or we can write down the  
equation in the form the solution in the form psi  equals to half a zero plus sum over n r to the  
power n a n cos n theta plus b n sin n theta   Now, we are applying the boundary condition  
which says that psi at r equals to a theta equals  to f theta  So, satisfying this condition we get  
f theta equals to half a zero plus sum  of n equals to zero to infinity a n  
a to the power n into a n cos n theta plus b n  sin n theta  So, from this expression it is clear  
that this is the Fourier series expansion of  the function f theta  So, the coefficients  
a n b n can be obtained using the Fourier  transformation like which is written here   
Now, if we equate one by X d two X dx square  is equal to k, we will get an equation  
of potential theory the physical conditions  are such that they are identical in some planes  
function cos n theta and sin n theta, we get the  expression for a n b n, which are written here   
Now, it is to be noted that there is an infinite  series in the summation and we want to find the  
sum of the value of this sum  To find the  value of this sum we assume C as this, sum  
power n into sin n Phi minus theta  Now, if we calculate C plus i s  
r by a is less than one and mod of e to the  power i Phi minus theta is also less than one   
So, the sum of the GP series can be written  in this form r divided by one minus r  So,  
this is written here  Now, if we  
equate the real part and imaginary part from the  both side we can get the expressions for C and S   
Since we are interested to find the value of C,  we equate the real part from the right hand side  
and we get the value of C  which is written here    
Therefore, the solution psi becomes one by two  pi integration over zero to two pi a square  
minus r square f phi by a square minus two a  r cos phi minus theta plus r squared d phi,  
where r is less than a  This integral  is known as Poisson integral formula  
and this gives a unique solution of the  interior Dirichlet problem for a circle   
Now, I am going to discuss exterior Dirichlet  problem for a circle  The exterior Dirichlet  
problem for a circle is defined as  follows, we have to find the value of the  
square equals to K, we will get another equation  d two Y dy square plus ky is equal to zero   
function single valued function psi which is also  continuous at any point exterior of a circle r is  
equal to a, which satisfies the Laplace equation  which is written in equation number eleven,  
for r greater equals to a, zero less than  equals to theta less than equals to two pi  
and it will psi will satisfy the boundary  condition psi a theta equals to f theta,  
where f theta is continuous function of theta  and psi is bounded as r going to infinity   
Now, there is a difference between an interior  Dirichlet problem and an Exterior Dirichlet  
their term is not bounded as r going to  infinity  So, the solution is of the form  
which is written in equation number twenty   And in the solution you can see that the term  
r to the power minus n is present, because  these term is bounded as r going to infinity   
Now, this separation constant k may take different  values  So, according to the values of the  
Now, if we use the boundary condition psi a theta  equals to f theta we get f theta equals to half a  
zero plus some n equals to one to infinity a to  the power minus n a n cos n theta plus b n sin n  
Thus the solution of exterior Dirichlet problem  becomes psi equals to which is given here    
Then proceeding exactly as we have done  in the earlier case in case of interior  
Dirichlet problem, we can obtain the value of  the infinite series  And we finally subsequently  
we can get the expression for psi which is  written here psi equals to one by two pi  
integration zero to two pi r square minus a square  f phi by r square minus two a r cos phi minus  
theta plus a square d phi, for r greater  than a, and this is our required solution   
Now, I am going to discuss interior Neumann  problem for a circle  So, for this case  
separation constant k, three cases may arise  So, first we take the case where k is positive   
we have to find the continuous function  psi, which satisfies the Laplace equation  
together with the boundary condition, where  the normal derivative of the function psi  
is prescribed  So, we have to solve  the Laplace equation eleven together  
with the boundary condition del psi del n  equals to for this case it is del psi del r  
equals to g theta, where g theta is  some continuous function of theta   
Since phi must be bounded at r equals to zero,  
we take the solution in this form where r to the  power minus n term is missing and you have to  
consider only r to the power n term  So, solution  is written here and so this solution can be  
written in the form which is written in  equation number twenty one, where the constants  
So, in case one k is equal to some  p square, where p is a real number   
condition we set it which says that  del psi del r equals to g theta   
So, using that condition we get g theta equals to  sum over n n a to the power n minus one into a n  
cos n theta plus b n sin n theta, it is again a  Fourier series expansion of g theta  So, using  
the theory of Fourier series we can obtain the  values of a n and b n, which is written here   
Therefore, solution becomes psi equals to  half a plus integration zero to two pi g phi  
into the infinite sum of r by a to the  power n a by n pi to cos n phi minus theta  
d phi  Again we can find the value, value  of this infinite sum using the procedure,  
which we have done in the earlier cases  Assuming C as the sum and S as the sum and  
then computing C plus i s you can find the value  of the infinite sum, then equating the real part  
of the previous expression from both sides  We get  the expression for C which is written here  Thus  
So, the corresponding equation becomes d two  x dx square minus p square x equals to zero  
psi equals to half a minus a by two pi integration  zero to two pi log of one minus two r by a cos phi  
minus theta plus r square minus a square  g phi d phi, where r is less than a    
Now, I am going to discuss about the Laplace  equation in spherical polar coordinates,  
where the independent  variables are r theta and phi,  
in some cases there is some axial  symmetry in the problem  So, for that case  
there is a symmetry about the polar axis  theta equals to zero and psi is independent  
of phi  So, the Laplace equation  
in spherical polar coordinate becomes which  is written in equation number twenty three   
Again we are using the method of separation of  variables to find solution of this equation   
So, we assume psi as product of function R and  theta where R theta are function of small r and  
and its solution is capital X equals to C one e  to the power px plus C two e to the power minus px  
small theta respectively  And the surface  theta is called the zonal surface harmonic   
So, if you substitute twenty four into  twenty three, we get the equation, we can  
separate the expression for capital R and capital  theta, which is written in twenty five like k is  
the separation constant and we are substituting  the value of k as n into n plus one    
So, if you substitute that we get the r equation,  
equation for capital R which is written  in equation number twenty six and equation  
for capital theta which is written  in equation number twenty seven   
Equation number twenty six is an ordinary  differential equation, which is in Cauchy Euler  
form  So, its solution can be obtained easily   Now, if we look at equation number twenty seven  
we need to substitute mu equals to cos theta   Now, the equation taking mu as independent  
and the solution of d two y dy square plus p  square y equals to zero is capital Y equals  
variable equation twenty seven reduces to  the form which is written here d d mu of  
one minus mu squared d theta d mu plus n  into n plus one into theta equals to zero   
This is famous Legendre equation and we know the  solution of Legendre equation is Legendre function  
or Legendre polynomials  So, the solution is  written in equation number twenty nine   
So, this is linear combination of Legendre  functions of first kind and second kind   
Thus, the solution can be written using the  superposition principle psi is equal to sum over  
n A n r to the power n plus B n r to the power  n plus one into C n P n mu plus D n Q n mu    
Thus in module two of chapter four, we have  discuss about the solution of a two dimensional  
Laplace equation using the method of separation  of variables  We have discussed the cases  
taking different coordinate systems  like Cartesian coordinate system,  
to C three cos py plus C four sin py  So, the solution of the original equation  
polar coordinate system and spherical polar  coordinate system  We have also shown that  
that means solution of equation one is psi  is equal to capital X into capital Y, so that  
which are parallel to a given plane  For  example, let us take that given plane  
equals to C one e to the power px plus C two e  to the power minus py into C three cos py plus  
C four sin py  Where, all C j's are constants,  for J equals to one, two, three, four    
Now, come to the case when K equals to zero   
C five X plus C six and the Y equation becomes in  the same form D two y dy square equals to zero,  
so it's solution is C seven y plus C  eight, so psi becomes C five X plus C  
square which is a negative number where  P is a real constant  So, for this case  
Till now we have discussed about the solution  of a two dimensional Laplace equation  
but we didn't discussed about the  boundary condition of those problem    
Now, we are going to discuss about the Dirichlet  problem of Laplace equation 
That means  we have to find the solution of equation  number one together with the boundary condition  
which is shown here  So, here we are assuming the  boundary is a rectangle, so the value of psi are  
given in the boundaries Y is equal to zero, Y is  equal to b, X equals to zero and x equals to a   
And the boundary conditions are written  here psi at zero y equals to psi  
at a y equals to psi at X B equals to zero and  psi at X zero equals to some known function f x   
Thus this is an interior Dirichlet problem  
the function del psi del Z and del two psi  del Z square is identically equals to zero   
where you have to find the solution of Laplacian  equation, grad square psi equals to zero  
in the interior points of the rectangle zero  less than equals to X less than equals to a  
and zero less than equals to y less than  equals to b, subject to the boundary conditions  
which are written in equation seven  And we also assume that f x can be expanded  
in Fourier sin series  Now, if we consider this  boundary condition seven, if we use the first  
gives we have to put x equals to zero and  x equals to a, so it gives C one, if we put  
x equals to zero we get C one plus C two equal to  zero if we put x equals to zero in equation four  
we get C one plus C two equals to zero and  if we put x equals to a in equation four  
we get C one e to the power PA plus C two  e to the power minus PA equals to zero   
Thus, the Laplace equation becomes del two psi del  X square plus del two psi C del Y square equals to zero    
So, those two equations are written  here, so if we solve these two equations  
we get the solution C one equals to C two equals  to zero  So, the function psi becomes zero   
So, this psi is a trivial solution of  the Laplacian equation, but we are not  
interested to the trivial solution, so to find  the non-trivial solution we have to think about  
the other two solutions which are written in  equation number five and equation number six   
Now, consider the solution five, so in that  solution if we put the condition psi zero  
y equals to zero and psi a y equals to zero,  this leads to the solution again psi equals to  
zero  Thus, the solution four  and five are not acceptable   
So, the only solution remains is the solution  six  So, if we look at the solution six,  
so this is our solution six  So, in this solution if we put the boundary  
So, this is the Laplace equation in two  dimension  Thus, in module two of chapter four  
into sin PA into c one one e to the power P y plus  C twelve e to the power minus py equals to zero   
Since we are looking for a non-trivial  solution C ten is not equal to zero   
And the expression which is written in the bracket  this cannot be zero, so the only option remains is  
sin PA equals to zero and we know the solution of  this equation is sin PA equals to zero equals to  
where n takes the values one,  two, three, four, dot, dot   
So, for all values of n this is the  solution of the Laplacian equation   
So, since Laplace equation is a linear equation,  so linear combinations of all the solution is  
also the solution of the Laplace equation and  this is called the superposition principle   
we are going to discuss about the solution of  a two dimensional Laplace equation 
So, using superposition principle we can  write the solution as psi equals to sum  
of n equals to zero to infinity sin n pi  x by a into a n e to the power n pi Y by a  
plus b n e to the power minus n pi Y by a  But, we need to apply another two boundary  
conditions, one of them is psi XP equals to  zero  So, if we use this boundary condition  
we can express the constant b n in terms of n  which is written here, b n equals to minus a n  
by e to the power minus n pi d by a  into e to the power n pi b by a   
Therefore, the expression for psi becomes psi  is equal to half sum over n a n sin n pi X by a  
the constant a n is equals to two  a n exponential of n pi B by a   
For the discussion we have to go to the slideshow  First of all I am going to discuss about the  
which we want to satisfy  So, that boundary  condition is psi x zero equals to f x    
n pi B by a  And from this summation you can  see that the right hand side is nothing but,  
the Fourier series expansion of the  function f x in terms of the sin series   
zero to a, we will get the coefficient using  the orthogonality property of sin function a  
So, from the last equation we can get the  values of the unknown numbers Capital A n   
Thus the required solution of  the interior Dirichlet problem  
solution of Laplace equation  in Cartesian coordinates   
﻿I am going to start module three of chapter four,  in module two of chapter four, I have discussed  
Now, you have to remember that,  there is one boundary condition left   
So, to satisfy that boundary condition and  that boundary condition is psi x, y, c,  
equals to f x, y  Now, if we apply this  boundary condition to our solution,  
is given here  So, if you see this expression  you can see that this is very known series and  
this is called the double Fourier series   So, the coefficients a m, n can be obtained  
in Cartesian coordinate system,  cylindrical coordinate system,  
in this way, we have to multiply this  series with sin m pi x by a into sin n pi  
y by b from in both sides  And then integrate  over zero to a and zero to b, that will give  
the values of m, n, through this relation  And  to find the values of a m, n, we have to use  
the orthogonality property of sin functions  So, using that property, we can find the values of  
are for m equals to one to infinity, n is  from one to infinity, and these lambda m n is  
given here pi into square root m square by a  square plus n square by b square  And a m n  
can be determined from the relation which is  given here  Thus this is our required solution  
in Cartesian coordinate system   
and spherical polar coordinate system   First I shall discuss about Cartesian  
Now, I am going to solve Laplace equation in  cylindrical coordinate system  In cylindrical  
coordinate system Laplace equation is written in  the form which is given in equation number five   
Here we shall use the same technique,  the separation of variables method  
to find the solution, for that purpose we  have written psi as product of functions  
capital R, capital theta and capital Z,  where R, theta, Z are functions of small r,  
small theta, and small z, respectively  So, if you substitute the expression for psi  
from six to equation five we get the equation,  which is written in equation number seven   
So, our aim is to separate the variables,  so for that purpose first we separate  
coordinate system for that, now we have  to go to the slide show  As I have told  
Capital Z equals to C five e to the  power m z plus C six e to the power  
minus m z, where C five, C six are constants   
So, from equation seven, we have  already separated the variable Z,  
one by theta d two theta, d theta square equals to  minus n square  So, here n square is the another  
separation constant  So, the equation for  theta becomes d two theta, d theta square  
plus n square theta equals to zero   And its solution is theta equals to  
C three cos n theta plus C four sin n theta,  where C three and C four are constants   
But, there is another equation,  which is equation in R  
we want to find solution of a three dimensional  Laplace equation in different coordinate systems   
minus n square by r square, capital R equals  to zero  And this is very famous equation  
and this equation is known as bessel’s differential  equation  And we know that the solution of bessel’s  
differential equation is the Bessel function   So, the solution is written as capital R is equal  
first and second kind respectively  Therefore  the solution of Laplace equation in cylindrical  
coordinates becomes xi equals to product  of capital R, capital theta and capital Z   
And these are the expressions for capital  R, capital theta and capital Z    
Now, we want to solve a physical problem,  where we can use cylindrical coordinate system   
So, this is the example, a homogeneous thermally  conducting cylinder occupies the region  
zero less than equals to r less than equals to a,  zero less than equals to theta less than equals  
I shall use the technique, the separation  of variables method to find the solution   
to two pi and zero less than equals to z less  than equals to h, where small r, small theta,  
small z, are cylindrical coordinates   And the boundary conditions are like this, the top  
base z equals to zero is held at hundred degree  temperature  And we also assuming in this problem,  
that there is no source of heat generation  within the cylinder  So, we have to find  
for this problem the steady temperature  distribution within the cylinder    
the temperature we have to find the temperature  psi, which is a single valued function and this  
is for steady state, and this psi will satisfy the  Laplace equation grad square psi equals to zero,  
where zero less than equals to r less than  equals to a, zero less than equals to theta  
Now, the Laplace equation in Cartesian  coordinates can be written as grad square psi,  
less than equals to two pi and zero less  than equals to z less than equals to h   
And the boundary condition is given  that psi equals to zero at z equals to h  
and psi is equal to zero at r equals to  a  And there is third boundary condition,  
which is psi equals to hundred  at z equals to zero  So, from the  
boundary condition, we can note that the solution  cannot depends on the variable theta    
So, it can be assumed that the solution is  independent to theta, also it is to be noted that  
order n and of second kind and this Bessel  function has a singularity at r equals to zero   
Since in this physical problem there  is a point r is equal to zero 
So, it Y n is not defined that r equals to  zero, thus we need to omit the term Y n  
which is equals to del square psi, del x square,  plus del square psi, del y square, plus del  
and the solution is independent to theta  So, to make it independent to theta,  
we must have to take n equals to zero   Therefore from the general solution  
we can write the solution for this  particular problem as psi equals to C one  
So, that solution is written here, but we have  adjusted the constants in this way, this is a  
J zero into A e to the power m z, plus  B into e to the power minus m z   
Now, if we use the boundary condition  psi equals to zero at z equals to h,  
then we get the relation between A and B as  B equals to minus A e to the power two m h   
the power m z minus h, minus e to the power minus  m z minus h, or it can be written in the form psi  
square psi, del z square equals to zero   In the method of separation of variables,  
Now, we need to satisfy another boundary  condition, which says that psi equals to  
zero at r equals to a  So, it gives J zero m a  equals to zero  So, this is a Bessel function of  
the value of m a, as xi k or m equals to xi k  by a, where k equals to one, two dot, dot    
Therefore, using the principle of superposition,  we can write the general solution as psi equals to  
is psi equals to hundred ad z equals to zero  So,  it gives the relation hundred equals to sum over k  
the coefficient of Bessel function Bk  we need to multiply the relation with  
of Bessel function, we obtain the  relation which is written here,  
minus xi k h by a into a square  by two j one square xi k   
Here we have used the orthogonality property of  the Bessel function, that property is written  
is J one, so if we use this property we can  replace the integration in the left hand side  
here by J one, so replacing that we get  the relation which is written here   
So, from this relation we can easily find  the value of BK, so it is written here   
where X, Y, Z are functions of small  x, small y, and small z, respectively   
about solution of two dimensional Laplace  equation  But, two dimensional Laplace equation  
this, so these are the values of  BK, so that solution is written here  
and you have to remember that this xi k are the  roots of the equation J zero xi equals to zero   
Now, I am going to discuss the solution of Laplace  equation in spherical polar coordinate system   
The Laplacian in spherical polar coordinate  system is given in equation number nine   
Here we are applying the same method, the method  of separation of variables to find the solution   
So, first we are separating variables R  and the variable theta Phi, that means we  
are separating the variable R from theta and  Phi so that is given by the relation ten   
So, if you substitute ten in nine we obtain  the equation which is written in equation  
Phi, so in this way we are separating and we are  assuming that lambda is the separation constant   
Now, equating the expression for R which  is written here is equal to minus lambda  
we get the equation for capital R which  is written in equation number twelve   
And if you see this is famous Cauchy Euler  equation  So, the solution of this equation  
can be assumed in the form capital R equals to r  to the power m and this small m can be determined  
So, substituting this value of lambda we obtain  two values of m as n and minus n plus one   
Thus, the solution of R equation or the solution  of equation twelve is capital R is equal to c one  
r to the power n plus c two divided by R to the  power n plus one  Now, we have to find solution  
in equation number three   So, if we observe this equation,  
for capital F which is written  in equation number thirteen   
We have already assumed the value of  lambda as minus n into n plus one,  
so we are putting the value of lambda here  Now, we are again applying the method of  
separation of variables, so we are writing F  as product of capital theta and capital phi  
and we are substituting sixteen to fifteen to  obtain a relation which is written in seventeen   
Here we are separating the variables phi  and theta from this relation in this way   
So, in the left hand side we have only the  function of Phi and right hand side it is  
only the function of theta and to equate this  left hand side is equal to m square and this  
expression is equal to m square and we get  two equations which are written here   
So, from the phi equation we can obtain the  solution easily as Phi is equal to c three cos  
we wrote the equation in terms of  Y and Z term, in the left hand side  
axi-symmetric case that means for that case if  m is equal to see the equation number eighteen,  
if we put m is equal to zero in this equation  capital Phi becomes a constant that means for that  
case solution does not depend on the variable Phi,  so this case is called the axi-symmetric case   
Now, this is the equation for capital  theta and from this equation we substitute,  
we make a change in the independent variable  through this relation, mu is equal to cos theta,  
so if you substitute this in this equation  In  terms of the independent variable mu we obtain  
the equation which is written here  And if you see this equation, this is  
Legendre equation but there is some extra terms  here and we know that solution of this equation  
is the associated Legendre function   Therefore, solution of that equation  
of equation three and the term involving the  variable small x is written in the another side,  
can be written as linear combination of two  Legendre function, associated Legendre function  
which is written here theta mu as c five  P n m mu plus c six Q n m mu where P n m  
and Q n m are associated Legendre function  of first and second kind respectively or in  
terms of theta we can write the function in  this way which is written in equation number nineteen    
Thus, the general solution of Laplace equation  
can be written in this way psi equals to sum  over m sum over n c one r to the power n plus  
c two r to the power n plus one into c three cos  m Phi plus c four sin m phi into P n m cos theta   
In particular for axi-symmetric case it doesn't  depend on Phi, so the general solution can be  
written as psi which is function of only R  and theta, so it is sum over m sum over n  
c one R to the power n plus c two divided by  R to the power n plus one P n m cos theta   
Now, I shall discuss a physical problem  where spherical polar coordinate comes  So,  
this is the problem we have to find the value  of psi at any point in the interior of a sphere  
R equals to a such that it's Laplacian  is equals to zero over this region and  
the boundary condition is psi at r equals  to a is given by the function small f   
Now, if we look at the general solution of the  spherical polar coordinate which is written in  
satisfies the given boundary conditions  Since  R is equal to zero is a point within the sphere,  
so the solution must exist, exist at R equals  to zero, but if we see the general solution,  
this solution does not exist at R equals  to zero if c two is not equals to zero   
So, we take c two equals to zero  So,  the solution can be written in this form,  
lambda one square is the separation constant   So, if we equate one by X,  
so only R to the power n term is there and  all other terms are present which is written  
in equation number twenty two  Now, to satisfy  the boundary condition we have to put R equals  
to a and value of psi is f, so if we substitute  this, if you satisfy this boundary condition  
first to obtain A m n you have to multiply  this relation with cos m pi into P n m mu  
and then integrate over minus one to one  zero to two pi this, then you get   
Now, using the orthogonality property of the  Legendre function, associated Legendre function  
we can write the value of minus one to plus one  P n m mu square d mu and all other terms will  
be zero due to orthogonality property  And  here also only cos m pi term will be there,  
d two X, d x square is equal to minus lambda one  square  We get the ordinary differential equation  
all other terms will be zero due to  orthogonality property of Fourier modes    
So, using those property we can obtain the values  of A n m, this is the expression, so we get  
integration minus one to one zero to two pi F P  n m mu cos m pi d mu d Phi is equal to two pi a  
to the power n A m n m plus n factorial divided by  two n plus one n minus m factorial  So, from this  
equation we can obtain the value of m n easily  Similarly to obtain the value of B m n  
expression for B m n, so which is written  here, so we can obtain both A m n and B m n  
in this way  Thus the solution becomes  psi is equal to which is written here   
We can make a simplification like this,  we can write the cosine function and  
sin function together to make it as cos of m  chi minus phi, so this is our final solution  
or the required solution of the given problem   Thus, in module three of chapter four we have  
discussed about solution of three dimensional  Laplace equation in Cartesian coordinate system,  
cylindrical coordinate system and  spherical polar coordinate system    
We took three examples for three different cases  and for all the cases we considered Dirichlet  
problem  For Cartesian coordinates system the  solution is double Fourier series, for cylindrical  
coordinate system the solution is Bessel Fourier  series and for spherical polar coordinate system  
we can find solution of this ordinary differential  equation easily and the solution is written here  
capital X is equals to C one cos lambda  one X plus C two sign lambda two X, where  
another separating constant lambda two square   So, if we equate d two Y minus one by Y  
d two Y d Y square equals to lambda two square   We get an ordinary differential equation,  
which is written here d two Y d  Y square plus lambda two square  
Y equals to zero  And we can easily write the  solution of this equation, which is written here,  
Capital Y is equals to C three cos lambda  two y, plus C four sin lambda two y,  
Laplace equation  Thus in this module we shall  solve a three dimensional Laplace equation    
square into Z, where lambda three square equals  to lambda one square plus lambda two square    
of capital X, capital Y, and capital Z  So, it  is written here in equation number four    
Now, I shall consider one example  where Laplace equation comes  
in Cartesian coordinates  So, here is that  example, find the potential function psi  
It is to be noted that in reality, we need to solve  Laplace equation for many geometrical problem 
in a rectangular box define by zero less  than equals to x, less than equals to a,  
zero less than equals to y less than equals to b,  zero less than equals to Z less than equals to c,  
if the potential is zero on all sides and bottom  while psi equals to f, on the top of the box   
like this, if psi represent the potential  function, which is function of X Y and Z   
So, psi at x equals to zero is equal to  zero, psi at x equals to a is equal to zero,  
psi at y is equal to zero is equal to zero,  psi at y is equal to b is equal to zero,  
which is represent by represented  by the function small f   
For example, if there is an experiment in a box, we  need to consider Cartesian coordinate systems   
Now, we are going to solve this problem  together with the supplied boundary conditions   
We have already derived the solution  of Laplace equation in Cartesian form,  
which is written in equation number four   
Now, if we apply the boundary condition psi at  x equals to zero equals to zero and psi at a,  
x equals to a equals to zero, the  equation number four reduces to
C one  So, here we put x equals to zero   So, if we put x equals to zero it becomes C one,  
so psi at x equals to zero equals to zero implies  C one equals to zero and the other condition  
Now, C two cannot be zero, because  we already got that C one is zero,  
but C two cannot be zero, if C two is zero,  then psi becomes zero for all x, y, z   
And if there is an experiment in a pi, we have to  consider, or it is convenient to use cylindrical  
So, that is a trivial solution, but we are not  interested in trivial solution  So, we assume  
that C two is not equals to zero  Therefore  to satisfy the second boundary condition,  
by a, where m is a positive integer  Now, think about the third boundary condition,  
y is equal to zero  So, if we put y is equal  to zero, then it becomes the second expression  
So, we get C three equals to zero  and in the similar way, if we apply  
coordinate systems  Therefore it is necessary  to find solution of Laplace equation taking  
this boundary condition psi x, y is equal  to b z equals to zero, then it will give  
sin lambda two b equals to zero  So, C four with the similar argument, we can say  
that C four cannot be zero, otherwise  it will give a trivial solution  So,
we get the only option to satisfy the boundary  condition is sin lambda two b equals to zero   
So, it implies that lambda two b must  be equals to m into pi, where m is  
an integer, or in other words we can  say that lambda two can takes the values  
n pi by b, where n is an integer  Now, we have two more boundary conditions   
The condition psi x, y, zero equals  to zero leads to the condition C five  
different geometrical problems or  in different coordinate systems   
C six sin hyperbolic lambda three Z, or we  can write these three constants together  
as constant a  So, psi is  equal to a sin lambda one x,  
Now, we have one condition,  
now we note that in this solution this  lambda one, lambda two are not arbitrary,  
plus lambda two square  So, if we substitute the  values of lambda one and lambda two, we get the  
values of lambda three as pi into square root of m  square by a square, plus n square by b Square    
And you can see that, the values of lambda  three depends on the values of m and n,  
Thus in module three objector four, we shall  discuss about solution of Laplace equation  
Now, I am going to start chapter five  This chapter consist of the discussion on parabolic
psi attains its maximum at a point in the boundary  That means at a point in del R where
region smaller which is the upper boundary in this figure which is nothing but the line
t is equal to tau 
maximum at the point x bar tau, so its first order derivative is zero and second order derivative
The heat conduction or diffusion equation is given by the partial differential equation,
at the point x bar tau is less than equals to zero 
Now, psi at the point x bar tau is greater equals to psi at the point x bar t tau minus
neighborhood of x bar tau is, must be less than the value of psi at the point x bar tau 
This is the property of having maxima of a function  And this delta can lie in between
minus delta minus psi x bar tau divided by minus delta 
Now, the numerator of this expression is less than zero using the property which is written
here  So, this is less than zero minus delta less than zero  So, we get this ratio is greater
k nabla square T is equal to del T del t, which is written in equation number one, where
value of this quantity we have just obtained is greater equals to zero 
And we also found that psi x x, x bar tau is less than equals to zero  Therefore, the value of
this expression that means L dash psi becomes a non-negative number  That means
this is greater or equals to zero, which again contradicts the result which is written in
in the region R  So, again we get that L dash psi is greater equals to zero for a point
in the region small r which contradicts the result which is written in equation seven,
which says that L dash psi is less than zero 
nabla square is the operator which is equivalent to del two del x square plus del two del y
is less than equals to capital M plus epsilon L square 
Therefore, psi is less than equals to capital M plus epsilon L square  So, for any point
in the region capital R we obtain psi less than equals to M plus epsilon L square  Now,
putting the value of psi as T plus epsilon x square, so this is less than equals to capital M
plus epsilon L square  So, capital T is less than equals to capital M plus epsilon
into L square minus x square on capital R 
if you take epsilon tends to zero, we obtain T, x, t is less than equals to capital M on
capital T in the region gamma  Or in other words, we can say that maximum of the value
capital T in the region capital R is attained in the region gamma 
is the proof of maximum-minimum principle for one-dimensional heat equation  Now, using
the maximum-minimum principle I want to state the uniqueness theorem  So, this is the statement
initial condition T, x, 0 equals to fx and boundary conditions T zero, t equals to g
arise  So, let us consider that capital T represent the temperature at a point in a
of their domains of definition, then the solution of this system is unique 
and the other one is T two  So, T one and T two, these two solutions will satisfy the
heat equation six and they will also satisfy the initial and boundary condition  Now, we
consider another function, v which is equals to T one minus T two 
Now, it is easy to prove that the function v will also satisfy the heat equation which
is written in equation number six  In the region zero less than equals to x less than
equals to capital L, zero less than equals to t less than equals to tau and is a continuous
function of x and t  Now, if we think about the initial condition for the function v,
T one at x zero is fx and T two at x zero is fx, so it becomes zero 
So, v at x, zero is equals to zero for zero less than equals to x less than equals to
zero, t, which is equals to g one t minus g two t  g one t minus g one t, so it becomes
zero and similarly, v at L, t is equals to zero in zero less than equals to t less than
principle we can say that the maximum and the minimum value of v, t are attained in
the region gamma and it is given that in the region gamma the value of v, t is zero 
Therefore, the maximum and the minimum value of v, t in the whole region capital R is equals to zero 
So this implies that T one minus T two is equals to zero in the region capital
R or in other words, t one is equal to t two in the region capital R  So, it says that
the solution is unique  There is another important theorem which is stability property or stability theorem 
It says that the solution of the heat equation six for the Dirichlet conditions
which is defined by T, x, zero equals to fx for zero less than equals to x less than equals
on the initial and boundary conditions 
Thus, in module one of chapter five we have discussed about the occurrence of heat equation
in many physical systems  We have also discussed the maximum-minimum principle for one-dimensional
heat equation  Using that principle we proved that the solution of heat equation is unique 
We have also stated that the solution depends continuously on initial and boundary condition 
Now, we end this module 
partial differential equation  The mostly occurred parabolic differential equation is
small t, denotes the amount of heat generated due to radioactive decay or absorption of
where kappa is defined as k pi rho c 
The equation is written in equation number two  And if you observe equation two, this
is nothing but heat equation  So, for this case conduction of heat in a solid we get
heat equation  We shall take another example that is shown here  So, this is the process
heat equation or the diffusion equation  The phenomena of diffusion occurs in many natural
So, we get again heat equation for the diffusion process in an isotropic substance 
as curl of velocity 
systems like diffusion of heat, diffusion of velocity in fluid flows, etcetera 
And this is the last example where I want to show that we again get heat equation 
In this example, we consider the propagation of a long waves in a good conductor, then
the components of electric field vector capital E will satisfy the equation, del E del t equals
to nu Gratt square E, where E is the electric field vector 
equation  Therefore, we have seen taking four different examples that heat equation or the
Therefore, it is important to study the heat equation or the diffusion equation 
diffusion equation arise in many physical problems  In last section, we have discussed
about the occurrence of heat equation in many physical problems 
Now, I am going to discuss the maximum-minimum principle for one-dimensional heat equation
and its consequences  The maximum-minimum principle has been discussed in chapter four
occurred in the boundary of the region of harmonicity of the function  The similar type of
Now, in this section, I am going to discuss the maximum-minimum principle and its consequences
del T of capital T is equal to kappa del two T del x square, which is written in equation
The entire chapter is divided into four modules  In module one, we shall discuss about the
of capital T which satisfies the heat equation which is written in equation number six 
Let capital R is the region given by zero less than equals to x less than equals to
capital L and zero less than equals to t less than equals to tau  And this is a closed rectangle 
T, capital R such that t equals to zero or x equals to zero or x equals to L 
occurrence of heat equation in many physical systems  In module two, three and four, we
is attained in the region gamma 
region gamma  We shall show that maximum of capital T over the region capital R is less
than equals to capital M  To prove this we consider an auxiliary function psi is equal
R minus gamma, we have L dash psi where L dash is the operator 
Del del T minus kappa del two del x square  So, if we operate L dash on psi,
So, if we operate L dash on epsilon x square, the first term del del T term will
shall discuss about the solution of diffusion equation in one-dimension, two-dimension
contribute zero and the next term del two del x square will give the value two  So,
so it becomes a negative number which is given by equation number seven 
for psi, psi is equals to T plus epsilon x square  And we know that maximum of capital
is less than equals to capital M plus epsilon L square  If psi attains its maximum at an
to del del T of psi at the point x one, t one minus kappa del two psi del x square,
x one, t one 
The first term is zero and the second term means the value of del two psi del x square
is negative because we have assumed that psi attains its maximum at the point x one, t
one  Therefore, del two psi del x square at the point x one, t one is a negative number 
Let that negative number is minus capital K  So, the value of L dash psi at the point
x one, t one becomes greater or equals to zero and which contradicts the result which
is given in equation seven  Seven says that for any x, t belongs to R minus gamma, L dash
L dash psi is greater equals to zero  So, which is a contradiction, so the contradiction
arrives because we assume that psi attains its maximum at an interior point, x one, t one 
we are going to the power point presentation of this module 
Now, I am going to start module two of chapter five  This module is devoted to the study
outside the surface  We have to show the expression for capital T which is written here, where
erf is the error function 
So, the problem can be written as we have to find the function capital T which satisfies
the one-dimensional heat equation which is written here subject to the initial condition
T, x, zero equals to T zero for a less than x less than b where T zero is some constant
or the fundamental solution, the expression for capital T can be written in this way 
Now, the range of y is minus infinity to plus infinity but for this problem
B  So, we can put the value of fy as T zero within the range a to b  And outside this
minus of x minus y by two square root kappa t is equal to xi 
So, we are transforming the variable from y to xi, so in terms of the variable xi the
integral becomes this which is written here and the corresponding the limit also change 
Now, this integral can be written in this way  We can break the integral in this way 
So, this is T zero by two, two by square root pi zero to b minus x pi two square root kappa
t to the power minus xi square d xi minus two by square root zero to a minus x by two
square root kappa t to the power minus xi square d xi 
And this function is known as error function  So, the first integral can be written as error
slide of this module 
square root kappa t  Thus, we get the required solution for capital T for this particular
problem  Now, one-dimensional heat equation in Cartesian coordinate can be written in
this form which is given in equation number thirteen 
Here, we are again using the method of separation of variable  So, T is assumed as product of
capital X and tau, where capital X and tau are functions of X and T respectively  So,
substituting the expression for capital T in equation thirteen we obtain the equation,
one by X d two X, d X square equals to one by kappa tau, d tau dt  So, in this way we
are separating the variable x and t  Let lambda be the separation constant 
So, the equation for capital X and tau becomes d two X d x square minus lambda X equals to
We are considering one-dimensional wave equation which is written in one, del T del t
all, we assume that the separation constant lambda is a positive number  So, lambda is
greater than zero  So, lambda can be written as lambda equals to mu square, where mu is
a real constant  So, putting this value of lambda the equation for capital X becomes
d two X dx square minus mu square X equals to zero  So, the solution can be written as
X equals to c one e to the power mu x plus c two e to the power minus mu x 
And the solution for tau can be obtained easily as tau t equals to c three e to the power
kappa mu square t, where c one, c two, c three are integrating constants  So, substituting
the values of capital X and tau in the original equation we get the expression for capital
T as A e to the power mu x plus B e to the power minus mu x, into e to the power kappa
Equals to kappa del two T, del x square, where x varies from minus infinity to plus infinity
mu square t, where capital A is equal to c one, c three and capital B equals to c two, c three 
Now, I am going to the second case where lambda equals to zero  So, if lambda equals to zero,
the solution for capital X becomes c one x plus c two and the solution for tau becomes
tau equals to constant, which is equals to c three  Therefore, the required solution
to c two, c three 
Now, the last case when lambda is less than zero, so lambda can be written as minus mu
square where mu is a real constant  So, capital X becomes c one cos mu x plus c two sin mu
x and the tau is equal to c three e to the power minus kappa mu square t  So, the solution
for this case can be written as T is equal to, which is given in this slide  Here we
also modified the constant c one, c two, c three in this way  Capital A is c one, c three
and capital B is c two, c three 
system  So, in this problem, there is a uniform rod of length L whose surface is thermally
insulated and initially it is in temperature T is equal to T zero  At time t is equal to zero,
one end is suddenly cooled to T is equal to zero and subsequently maintained at this
temperature  The other end remains thermally insulated  And we have to find the expression
for capital T 
So, this is a one-dimensional problem  So, we have to find solution of one-dimensional
heat equation which is written here  Subject to the initial condition capital T, x, zero
one divided by square root two pi kappa t, exponential of minus x minus xi square divided
equals to T zero where x is zero, lies between zero and capital L  Capital L is the length
of the rod and the boundary condition is T at the end x equals to zero it is zero 
And the other end this is insulated, so the normal derivative of the temperature del T, del x
is zero for t greater than zero 
coordinates, this is the general solution  Capital T is equal to A cos mu x plus B sin
mu x, e to the power minus kappa mu square t  Now, we need to satisfy the boundary condition
and the initial condition for this problem  So, if we satisfy the boundary condition T,
zero, t equals to zero, so it gives capital A is zero  And the boundary condition del
T del x, L, t equals to zero it gives cos mu L equals to zero 
by four kappa t, is a solution of equation one 
And we know the solution of cos mu L equals to zero gives mu L equals to two n plus one
into pi by two  So, this gives the value of mu as mu equals to two n plus one into pi
into pi square t, into sin of two n plus one by two L, pi x 
Using the principle of superposition the linear combinations of all solution is also the solution
of the original equation  Thus, we obtain the expression for capital T as sum over n,
use the initial condition T, x, zero equals to T zero  So, using that initial condition
we obtain T zero equals to sum over n B n sin two n plus one by two L into pi x 
If we compute del T del t and del two T, del x square from the expression two and put in
So, this is a very well-known series and this is called the half-range Fourier sin series 
And we know how to find the constant B n from this half-range Fourier series  So, to obtain
then we need to integrate over zero to L  That will give the value of B n as four T
In plane polar coordinate, the heat equation takes the form  So, there are two independent variables
with one is time t and another one is the radius vector small r  So, now we are
going to apply the same process, the method of separation of variables 
equation one, it will satisfy equation one  And the solution which is written in equation
For that we are writing capital T as product of capital R and tau  And substituting this
expression in the equation eighteen we obtain the equation which is written here, one by
R d two R d r square plus one by r d R, d r equals to one by kappa tau, d tau dt  So,
in this line, we separated the variable R and T and now we are assuming the separation
constant as mu square  So, this equals to mu square gives two ordinary differential
equation  One is in capital R, other one is in tau 
So, the equation in capital R is d two R d r square plus one by r d R d r plus mu square
R equals to zero  And the equation for tau is written here  The solution of the tau equation
is very easy to find and the solution tau is equal to c three e to the power minus kappa
mu square t  Now, if we look the equation for capital R this is again a Bessel differential
of one-dimensional parabolic equation   The example of parabolic partial differential
equation of order zero  So, its solution is the linear combination of two Bessel’s functions
of first and second kind 
of the equation is capital T is equal to A J zero plus B Y zero into e to the power minus
kappa mu square t, where capital A is equal to c one, c three and capital B is equals
to c two, c three  In this section, we shall discuss about the solution or one-dimensional
heat equation in spherical polar coordinates 
The heat equation in spherical polar coordinates can be written  We are again using the method
of separation of variables to find solution  So, we substitute capital T as capital R into
tau, so substituting that we get then equation which is written here  Let mu square is the
you see the solution, we can observe that T, x, t is an analytic function of x and t
separation constant  So, equating mu square is equal to the R equation and tau equation 
The equation becomes d two R, d r square plus two by r d R d r plus mu square R equals to
zero and the tau equation becomes d tau dt equals to minus kappa mu square tau 
It is easy to find solution of the tau equation  This is the exponential function  So, the
solution can be written as tau equals to c one, e to the power minus kappa mu square
t  Now, to solve the R equation we need to substitute capital A as variable as smaller
into capital R  Now, the R equation becomes to the equation in terms of the variable capital
S as d two S d r square plus mu square S equals to zero 
for all t greater than zero and it is positive for all x 
Where capital A is A one c one and capital B equals to B one c one  So, this is the general
solution of heat equation in spherical polar coordinate system 
Therefore, in module two of chapter five we have discussed about the solution of one-dimensional
heat equation  Firstly, we have discussed about the fundamental solution of the heat
coordinate systems  In Cartesian coordinate system, the solution is the Fourier modes
and in plane polar system the solution is the Bessel function and in spherical polar
system we obtain the solution in terms of the Fourier modes  Thus we end module two
of chapter five 
Thus, the entire x axis is the region of influence for this parabolic equation 
to infinity  So, these are the properties of the fundamental solution of equation one 
Now, we want to find solution of equation one together with the initial condition T,
So, we put capital T is equals to capital X into capital tau  So, if we substitute this
One by capital X, d two X, dx square is equal to one by kappa tau, d tau dt  So thus, we
equation which occurs most frequently in nature or any physical system is the heat equation
separate the variables or the functions capital X and tau in this way  Let the separation
or we can find the value of tau as c into e to the power kappa lambda t 
from the physical point of view  We assume that f x tends to zero at mod x tends to infinity
and the value of capital T is bounded  That means mod T is less than M as mod x tends
to infinity  So, T, x, t to remain bounded, we have to take lambda negative  So, for that
Thus putting lambda is equal to minus mu square the expression for tau becomes tau equals
to c e to the power minus kappa mu square t  Now, there is another equation in capital
or the diffusion equation  Thus we have considered heat equation for the entire discussion in
X which is written here, d two X, d x square plus mu square X equals to zero and whose
are constant  So, the general solution of capital T becomes, T equals to A cos mu x
plus B sine mu x into e to the power minus kappa mu square t, where we modified the constant
as capital A is equal to c c one and capital B is equal to c c two 
Since f x is, in general, non-periodic, we consider Fourier integral instead of Fourier
series  So, instead of summation we  are considering integration  Also, A and B
are arbitrary  We consider them as function of mu  Now, we have to consider all possible
values of mu  Thus, the principle of superposition gives the summation of all product solutions 
Capital T equals to integration of zero to infinity, capital T, x, t, mu d mu 
this module  We have taken one-dimensional heat equation because one-dimensional equation
to integration zero to infinity A mu cos mu x plus B mu sin mu x, into e to the power
minus kappa mu square t d mu  We have the initial condition, T, x, zero equals to fx 
If we see the equation seven, this is, we can use the Fourier integral theorem 
The Fourier integral theorem says that f u is equal to one by pi, integration zero to infinity,
is easy to solve and the idea can be extended to solve the problem in two dimension and
sin B  Now, we separate the integral into two different as sum of these two terms as
one by pi integration zero to infinity cos mu x minus infinity to plus infinity f y cos
mu x plus B mu sin mu x d mu, where A mu equals to if you see the previous expression, so
one by pi integration minus infinity to plus infinity f y cos mu y dy and B mu is one by
pi minus infinity to plus infinity f y sin mu y dy 
three dimension 
infinity to plus infinity f y cos mu x minus y dy, d mu  So, the expression for capital
or the general solution of capital T is T is equal to one by pi zero to infinity minus
infinity to plus infinity f y cos mu x minus y, e to the power minus kappa mu square t
e to the power minus kappa mu square t cos mu x minus y d mu, dy 
Now, capital T is equal to one by pi integration zero to infinity, integration minus infinity
to plus infinity f y cos mu x minus y, e to the power minus kappa mu square t dy, d mu 
Now, in this step, we are interchanging the order of integration  So, it becomes equals
to one by pi integration minus infinity to plus infinity f y, integration zero to infinity
e to the power minus kappa mu square t, cos mu x minus y d mu, dy 
Apart from that there is some physical situation where heat flows only in one direction  Therefore,
Now, we want to compute the integral which is written in this square bracket  In the
last section, we have discussed about fundamental solution of a one-dimensional heat equation 
of variables method  The separation of variable methods is a very powerful method 
It can be applied in a wide variety of partial differential equation 
Using this technique I shall solve one-dimensional heat equation in Cartesian coordinates, plane
polar coordinates and spherical polar coordinates  So, for that discussion we have to go to the
slide show  We know the relation, zero to infinity e to the power minus z square cos
two b z dz equals to root pi by two, e to the power minus b square  We can obtain this
relation or the value of the expression which is written in the left hand side using the
it is worthy to study the one-dimensional heat equation  In this module, we shall first
property of gamma function, where b is real 
Now, in this relation, if we substitute z as mu into square root kappa t and b is equal
to x minus y by two into square root kappa t, it becomes zero to infinity e to the power
minus mu square kappa t cos mu, x minus y d mu is equals to the expression which is
we obtain capital T is equals to one by two square root pi kappa t, integration minus
infinity to plus infinity fy, e to the power minus x minus y whole square divided by four
kappa t dy 
Now, we shall take one example  In this example, this is a one-dimensional infinite solid
derive the fundamental solution of one-dimensional heat equation, then we shall use the separation
﻿Today, I am going to start module three of  chapter five  In module one of chapter five,  
J and Y are Bessel’s functions of first  kind and second kind respectively   
Hence, the solution of equation four,  that means the original equation is  
the constant C and D are defined as C equals  to c one E and capital D equals to c two E   
Now, we shall take one example where we can  use the solution of heat equation in polar  
coordinates  So, this is the example  We have to  find the temperature in a long cylindrical region  
bounded by the surfaces r equals to a,  theta equals to zero and theta equals to pi   
So, in these three surfaces are  maintained at zero temperature and  
its initial temperature is given  by the function small f   
of this module  The heat equation in Cartesian  coordinates is given by equation one,  
So, for solution we have to go back to the general  solution which is written in equation number seven  
this equation is valid for all r  But,  in our present problem this equation,  
the solution must valid for R equals to zero   
Therefore, we have to take the value of  constant B equals to zero   
So, from general equation we can  write the solution for our present  
into e to the power minus kappa mu square t  Now, we have to use the boundary conditions   
so here we have considered only two independent  variables, x and y  Now, we shall apply  
The boundary conditions are given that capital  T is equal to zero at theta equals to zero  
equals to pi gives sin lambda pi equals to  zero, so which implies that lambda must be  
an integer  So, let lambda equals to n and here  we have taken only positive integer values   
So, n equals to one, two, dot, dot  There is  one more boundary condition which is temperature  
equals to zero at r equals to a  So, this leads  to the equation J lambda mu a equals to zero   
And we have already found that the value of lambda  is an integer  So, this implies J n mu a equals to  
can be written using the principle of  superposition as capital T equals to sum over i,  
the method of separation of variables   For that we write the solution capital T  
capital T, r theta zero equals to small f, r,  theta  So, if we use this initial condition  
we need to integrate over zero to a  This is  the range for smaller and zero to pi this is  
the range for theta  So, if you do this using  the orthogonality property of Bessel’s function  
n plus one square, mu i a into pi by two  Where we have used the orthogonality property?  
The orthogonality property for Bessel function is  written in the first equation and in the second  
as product of three functions, capital X, capital  Y and tau, which are functions of small x,  
equation  The orthogonality property of sin  function is given  So, in this way we can  
find the values of A n i  The expression  for A n i is written in the last equation   
Thus the solution or the required solution  of the problem is capital T is four by  
e to the power minus kappa mu i square into  t, where B n i is given by the equation  
which can be seen here  Now, I am going to discuss  
the solution of heat equation in spherical polar  coordinate system  The equation in spherical polar  
coordinate system is written in equation number  eight  So, now we are using the same procedure   
That means we are writing the variable capital T  as product of capital R, capital theta and tau   
And we substitute T in equation  eight to obtain equation nine   
small y and small t respectively  Now, if we substitute  
If you observe equation nine, again we are  separating the variable tau from R and theta   
And here we are assuming the separating  constant as minus mu square because we  
want a bounded solution and the solution for  tau can be obtained easily as tau equals to E  
e to the power minus kappa mu square t  Now the equation, our next aim to separate the  
variable capital R and capital theta, so for that  purpose we separate that in equation number ten   
Now, the equation in capital R and capital  theta are written in equation number eleven  
and equation number twelve  So, if you observe  equation number eleven, in this equation if you  
do the substitution, mu r, capital R equals  to mu r to the power minus half, into S r   
In terms of the variable capital S,  the equation becomes d two S d r square  
the value of capital T in one, we get an  equation which is written in equation number two   
plus one by r, dS dr plus mu square minus n  plus half whole square by r square into S   
If we observe the R equation, this equation is not  in standard form  So, we give the transformation  
from capital R to capital S to obtain an equation  in capital S which is very known equation    
So, the solution of this is famous Bessel’s equation  And the solution of this equation  
Bessel’s functions of first kind and second time  kind respectively and both the functions of order  
as mu r to the power minus half into S r, which  is written in the last equation of this slide   
At equation number twelve, this is not so much  familiar to me, but if we give a transformation,  
cos theta equals to mu dash, the equation twelve  deduces to the form which is written in the first  
First, we separate the time variable  from x and y variable  For that purpose  
equation  And this is known to all of us   This equation is known as Legendre equation  
and we all know that solution of Legendre  equation is Legendre function  So, theta can  
be written as linear combinations of two Legendre  functions of first kind and second kind   
functions of first and second kind respectively   So, if we substitute the values of capital R,  
original equation as capital T equals to  sum over n mu r to the power minus half,  
plus D n dash Q n cos theta into e to  the power minus kappa mu square t   
the function of x and y are written in  the left hand side of that equation   
to make the concept more clear  So,  in this example, we have to find the  
temperature distribution in a sphere of  radius A where its surface is kept at  
zero temperature and its initial temperature  is given by the function small f, r, theta   
So, if we go back to the general solution  which is written in equation number thirteen,  
so from this general solution we shall try to  find the solution which satisfies this particular  
boundary condition and the initial condition   In the general solution, if you observe  
there is the Bessel function of second kind which  is unbounded at r equals to zero  Therefore,  
to get the bounded solution we need  to put the value of B n dash as zero   
Again if we see the Legendre functions, the  Legendre function of second kind is undefined  
at theta equals to zero  So to,  incorporate this fact, we have to  
And the function of T is written in the right hand  side  Now, let the separation constant is minus  
take the value of B n dash equals to zero  Therefore, equation thirteen  
reduces to the form, capital T equals to sum  over n, A n into mu r to the power minus half, J  
n plus half mu r, P n cos theta into e  to the power minus kappa mu square t   
Now, we shall use the boundary condition   
The boundary condition is given that the  temperature is zero on the surface of the sphere,  
Let the solution of this equation  is mu one a, mu two a, and mu n a   
Therefore, the solution can be written  using the superposition principle as  
capital T equals to sum over n, sum over  i, A n i mu i r to the power minus half,  
J n plus half mu i r, P n cos theta, e to  the power minus kappa mu i square into t   
mu square  Here we have chosen the  separation constant as a negative number  
we have discussed about the occurrence of  a parabolic partial differential equations  
Now, to find the values of the unknown constant  A n i we need to apply the initial condition  
which is given here  The temperature  at time T equals to zero is determined  
by the function small f which is function of r  and theta  So, if we use these initial condition,  
we obtain the relation, small f equals to,  which is written here  And if you see this,  
this is a double series and this is mixture  of Bessel series and Legendre series   
with P n cos theta and then integrate over minus  one to plus one and the result is written here   
because we want a bounded solution  So, if we see the equation of tau, it becomes  
and then integrate over zero to a  Now, using the orthogonality property of Bessel  
function and Legendre function we obtain the  relation which is written in the first equation   
And from this equation we can easily  get the values of A n i which is written  
in the last equation  Hence, the required  solution is capital T is sum over i, sum over  
J n plus half mu i r, P n mu dash e to the  power minus kappa mu i square into t   
So here, we have just substituted the values  of A n i and we have defined the variable B n i  
So, this is our final or the required solution  for the given problem  Thus in module three of  
chapter five we have discussed about the solution  of a two-dimensional heat equation in different  
d tau dt equals to minus mu square kappa  tau  And the solution can be written easily  
coordinate systems, namely Cartesian, plane  polar, and spherical coordinate system   
We have used the method of separation  of variables to find the solution   
In Cartesian coordinate system we obtained double  Fourier system, we obtained mixed Bessel Fourier  
series and in spherical polar coordinate system  we obtained mixed Bessel and Legendre series   
In this way we end this module 
as tau equals to A one e to the power minus  kappa mu square t, which is a bounded solution,  
where A one is the integrating constant  Now, our  aim is to separate the variable small x and small  
y  For that purpose we separate in this way, which  is written in the slide  And we again consider  
another separation variable as minus p square  So, equating minus p square to the function of x,  
one by x d two x dx square, we get the equation  d two x dx square plus p square x equals to zero   
And d two y dy square plus q square y equals to  zero, where q square can be written in terms of  
mu square and p square as q square equals to mu  square minus p square  And these two equations  
in many physical problems  Among all physical  problems the heat equation or the diffusion  
Therefore, the solution of two-dimensional  heat equation in Cartesian coordinate can  
be written in the form which is given in equation  number three, where we have modified the constant  
in this way, capital C is assumed as C  one A one and capital D as D one A one   
Now, we shall take one example where  we can apply this type of solution   
So, the example is presented here   The boundaries of the rectangle  
zero less than equals to x less than equals  to a and zero less than equals to y less than  
equals to b are maintained at zero temperature   And initially, it is given that the temperature  
has the value small f, x, y  We have to find the  temperature profile for t greater than zero   
Now, we are trying to find the  solution of the above physical problem   
equation comes most frequently  For that reason,  in this module we have considered heat equation  
So, the temperature is given by the division  equation which is written in the first equation   
Now, we have to solve this equation  together with the supplied initial  
conditions and the boundary condition  The  initial condition is given as capital T,  
zero, y, t equals to capital T, a, y,  t equals to zero for zero less than y  
less than b and t greater than zero  And capital T, x, zero, t equals to capital T  
x, b, t equals to zero for zero less than x,  less than a and for all t greater than zero   
The boundary condition is given by, so these are  the boundary conditions  The initial condition  
is given by capital T, x, y, zero,  that means at time t equals to zero  
temperature takes the functional form small  f, x, y, where f is unknown function   
Now, the solution of two-dimensional heat  equation can be written as we have obtained in the  
or the diffusion equation for our discussion  Moreover, in some physical situation,  
last discussion as capital T equals  to A cos px plus B sin px into  
C cos qy plus D sin qy into e to the power minus  kappa mu square t, where mu square equals to p  
square plus q square  Now, if we apply the  boundary condition T at x equals to zero,  
so in this equation we get, if we put x equals  to zero, then we get a equals to zero   
Similarly, T at y is equal to  zero, equals to zero gives 
So, if we put y is equal to zero in this expression  that will give capital C equals to zero   
Thus, the general solution deduces to this form,  
capital T x, y, t equals to BD sin px sin  qy e to the power minus kappa mu square t   
There are, also two boundary conditions  which are T at x equals to a equals to zero   
So, if we apply this condition in the above  expression, we get sin p a equals to zero   
the problem can be considered as a two-dimensional  problem  Therefore, the module three of chapter  
So, this gives p equals to m pi by  a, where m is a positive integer   
Now, using the superposition principles  since heat equation is a linear  
partial differential equation we can apply  the principle of superposition to find the  
plus q square which is equals to pi square into m  square by a square plus n square by b square   
of m and n both  So, to find the values of A  m n we need to apply the initial condition   
five is devoted to find the solution of a  two-dimensional heat equation  In this module,  
The initial condition is given that the value of  capital T at T equals to zero is small f, x, y   
So, if we apply this initial condition, we  obtain a relation in the form, small f, x,  
y equals to sum over m, sum over n, A m  n sin m pi x by a, sin n pi y by b   
And from this expression it is clear that this  represent a double Fourier series  Particularly,  
So, using that we can obtain the values of  A m n as A m n equals to two a into two by b  
Thus, the solution can be written as capital  T is sum over m, sum over n, capital F m, n,  
sin m pi x by a, sin n pi y by b, e to  the power minus kappa mu m n square t,  
where capital F m, n is  nothing but capital A m, n   
we shall use the method of separation of variable  to find the solution and we shall find solution  
And the expression for capital  A m, n is given in the slide   
Now, we are going to discuss the solution of  heat equation in plane polar coordinate system   
The equation in polar, heat  equation in polar coordinate system  
is given in equation number four  Now, we shall  use the same procedure, that means the method of  
separation of variables to find solution  For  that we again write capital T as product of  
three functions, capital R, capital theta,  and tau, where capital R, capital theta  
and tau are functions of small r,  small theta and t respectively   
Now, substituting capital  T in equation number four  
we obtain an equation which is  written in equation number five   
So, in this process our aim is to first  separate the variable small t  So, the function  
in different coordinate systems, namely, Cartesian  plane, polar and spherical coordinate system   
A which is, so the expression which is function  of T is written in the right hand side   
And we assume the separation constant as a  negative number as minus mu square  So, solution  
Now, it remains to separate the variable capital,  the function capital R and capital theta   
So, in the next step or in equation six we have  separated the function capital R and capital theta  
and we assume the separation constant as  lambda square  So, if we equate it with the  
theta equation and capital R equation we obtain  two equations which are written in the slide   
And the theta equation is very easy to solve  Thus, the solution of theta equation is written  
here, C one cos lambda theta  plus C two sin lambda theta   
First, we shall start with Cartesian coordinate  system  So, let us go to the first slide  
In last two modules, we have discussed about the solution of One Dimensional and Two Dimensional
the solution which is written here, capital theta equals to C cos nu theta plus D sin
r where J nu and Y nu they are Bessel functions of order nu and of first kind and second kind
capital theta, capital Z into tau 
Now, we shall take one example where these type of equation may arise, so this is the
example  So, in this example there is a cylinder which is bounded by the planes z equals to
zero and z equals to one and the curved surface r is equal to a in the cylindrical coordinates
r, theta, z and its faces are maintained at zero temperature  So, z equals to zero and
of variables to find solution  So, for that purpose, we write capital T as product of
z equals to l, faces are maintained at zero temperature and the curved surface at the
temperature fz 
So, for this physical situation we have to find the steady temperature distribution within the cylinder 
So, we have to establish this relation  To solve this problem, first we
T del small t equals to zero, also for this physical situation the temperature is symmetric
about z axis so it is independent of theta 
of separation of variable for that capital T is written as product of two functions capital
capital X, capital Y, capital Z and tau which are functions of small x, small y, small z
R, capital Z where R, Z are function of small r and small z respectively 
So, substituting this expression in this equation, we obtain a relation which is written in the
R and capital Z which are written in the first line of this slide 
So, if we observed this equation the solution of this equation can be obtain easily, so
where I zero and K zero are modified Bessel functions of first and second kind respectively
and T respectively 
and you can observe that the order of the function is zero  So, these are Bessel functions of order zero 
Partial_Differential_Equations_6223
Again you can notice that the Bessel of second kind K zero has singularity at R equals to
we get C one equals to zero  The first initial condition gives C one equals to zero 
The second initial condition capital T r, l equals to zero gives sin lambda l equals
to zero  So, this restricts us to take the values of lambda as lambda equals to n pi
So, substituting this expression in one we obtain an equation which is written in equation
equals to a has the distribution f, z 
equation by n sin n pi z by l, and then we need to integrate over zero to l, then using
the orthogonality property of sin function we can obtain this relation which is given here 
by this equation which is written in this slide  Now, I am going to discuss about the
solution of heat equation in spherical polar coordinate system  The heat equation in spherical
polar coordinate system is given by equation number nine  Again we are using the same procedure,
the method of separation of variables to obtain the solution 
So, if we substitute the expression for capital T which is written here in equation nine,
we obtain an equation which is written in equation number ten  As usual we do we first
separate the time variable part, so the tau, the function of tau is written in the right
side  Again to get a bounded solution we take the separation constant as a negative number
can obtain the expression for tau, as tau equals to G e to the power minus kappa mu square t   s
Now, this is the another equation, so to separate, first we separate the phi equation from R
To get bounded solution we assume the separation constant at minus mu square, where
and theta equation and we take nu square as our separation constant  So, equate the phi,
equate the last these two quantity that means d two phi d phi square plus nu square phi
equals to zero  We obtain the solution as phi is equals E one cos nu phi plus E two sin nu phi 
Now, we need to separate the variable capital R and capital theta 
So, for that purpose we write the equation in this form and we are taking the separation
constant as n into n plus one, equating this with the expression for R and with the expression
in theta we obtain the equations in R and theta which are written in equation number
twelve and equation number thirteen respectively 
in the independent variable, in the dependent variable R we can obtain a Bessel function
and the solution can be written in this form capital R equals to mu r to the power minus
order n plus half and of first kind and second kind respectively 
the equation transform to this equation which is written here and this is very famous equation
and the solution of this equation is associated Legendre function, therefore solution can
be written as linear combination of associated Legendre function of first kind and second
of nu dash 
G e to the power minus kappa mu square t, where G is the integrating constant 
associated Legendre functions of the degree n  Now, substituting the values of capital
R, capital theta and capital phi we obtain the required solution which is written here,
G and F is F one capital G  So, this is our required solution  So, this is the solution
of heat equation in spherical polar coordinate system 
Now, we are going to solve a problem, for that purpose we take this example, we have
to find the temperature T in a sphere of radius a where its surface is maintained at zero temperature
function of second kind  We know that this Bessel function of second kind is not defined
or unbounded at r equals to zero  So, for this particular problem we can choose the
value of B as zero 
So, for that reason we have taken the value of B as zero and from the general solution
you can see that the Legendre, associated Legendre function of second kind is also undefined
Jn plus half mu a equals to zero and let mu one, mu two these are the roots of this equation 
Heat Equations  But, these type of questions may arise in some particular cases therefore,
distribution is given by the function f r, theta  So, f r, theta is equals to this  This
is obtain by putting T is equal to zero in the previous expression 
Now, this relation will give the value of Cnm  For that purpose you can see that this
is a mixed Bessel Legendre series  Now, using orthogonality property of Bessel’s function
need to use the solution of heat equation in spherical polar coordinate system  So,
in this problem we have to find temperate T in a sphere of radius a where its surface
lambda square  So, the Z equation becomes d two Z dz square plus gamma square Z equals
is maintained at zero temperature and the initial temperature is given by the function
small f 
If we go back to the general solution of heat equation in spherical polar coordinates system,
Since inside the sphere, r equals to zero is a point and we know that Bessel function
of second kind is unbounded at r equals to zero, therefore from the general solution
for this particular problem we can choose the value of B as zero 
theta is equal to zero is a point, but the Legendre function of second kind is undefined at theta
which is given that the surface r equals to, on the surface r equals to a
temperature is also zero 
to zero  So, that equation is written here and we assume that the solution of these equations
are mu one, mu two dot dot, these are the roots  So, using the principle of super position
the solution for this particular problem can be written as which is shown in this slide
in the first equation, capital T equals to sum over n sum over m Cnm mu nm r to the power
Now, these are the unknown constant in the solution  To obtain the values of unknown
constant we need to apply the initial condition  For this problem it is given that initially
the temperature is given by the function small f, that is in the general expression if we
put T is equal to zero we get the function small f  So, in this expression if we put
T equals to zero, so it becomes f and the right hand side is given here 
Now, from this expression it is easy to find the values of Cnm  To find the values of Cnm
we have to apply the orthogonality property of the Bessel function and Legendre function,
so if we use that we can obtain the value of Cnm, therefore general solution can be
written in this form which is given in the first equation and Cnm can be obtain from
the last equation using the orthogonality property 
Thus in module four of chapter five, we discussed about the solution of a three dimensional
heat equation in Cartesian coordinate system, cylindrical coordinate system and spherical
coordinate system  In Cartesian coordinate system the solution is a triple Fourier series,
in cylindrical coordinate system the solution is mixed Bessel, Fourier and hyperbolic function
but in case of spherical coordinate system the solution is mixed Bessel, Fourier and
Legendre function  Thus, we end module four of chapter five 
are written here  The constant beta square is defined as lambda square minus alpha square 
Therefore, the required solution is given by capital T is equal to the expression which
is written here where we have substituted the values of capital X, capital Y and capital
Z and tau  So, the equation, the solution is written in equation number four 
And in this solution we have redefined the constants as follows, capital E is equal to E one G
and capital F is equals to F one G and the constant mu square is defined as alpha square
plus beta square plus gamma square 
coordinates  So, in this problem the faces of the solid parallelepiped which are bounded
by the wall x equals to zero, x equals to a, y is equal to zero, y is equal to b and
z equals to zero z is equals to c and these boundaries are kept at zero temperature 
An initial temperature is given by the function small f, so this small f function is known
to the discussion on the solution of three dimensional heat equation 
To solve this problem, we need to go back to the general solution of heat equation which
Now, we need to find the values of the arbitrary constant A, B, C, D, E and
F for these particular problems, so these, the values of these constants can be obtained
using the boundary conditions and the initial condition 
The boundary condition is given T at x equal to zero, T at y is equal to zero, T at z equals
to zero is zero and T at x equals to a is equal to T at y is equal to b is equal T at
we get the values of constant A, C, E as zero 
b equals to zero and sin gamma c equals to zero  And these three equation gives the values
Here, we have taken only positive integral values of m, n and q and in the expression
if we go back to the general solution there is one term, exponential term with T which
is kappa into mu square, so for this particular problem we assume that lambda square is kappa
into mu square  So, these problem it becomes kappa pi square m square by s square plus
m square by b square plus q square by c square 
So, if you substitute these values of the unknown constant, the solution can be written
three different coordinate systems to find solutions  We shall find solution in Cartesian
The suffix m, n, q is given here because the value of capital K depends on m, n and q 
Now, we have one more condition which is the initial condition for this problem which we
have not used, that condition is written here capital T x, y, z, zero is equal to small
obtain a relation which is written here, small f equals to this expression 
rather you can say that this is a sin series, triple sin series, so the value of
K can be obtained using the orthogonality property of sin series  So, to obtain K we
coordinate system, cylindrical coordinate system and spherical coordinate system 
and integrate over zero to a, zero to b and zero to c and then we get the expression for
the constant capital K which is shown here 
square t, where capital F which is function of m, n and q is given by the equation which
is written here 
system  The equation heat equation in cylindrical coordinate system is written
in equation number five, we are using same method, the method of separation of variable
First we shall start with Cartesian coordinate system 
thus, we substitute t which is written in the form as product of capital R, capital
is written in equation number six 
hand side and we assume the separation constant as minus mu square to get a bounded solution
and solving it we get the expression for tau as capital G e to the power minus kappa mu
for that purpose we write the equation in the form which is given in equation seven
and we assuming the separation constant as lambda square to obtain the equation in Z which is written here
and the solution of this equation is written here capital Z equal
So, let us go to the first slide of module four  The heat equation in three dimensional
to E one cos hyperbolic lambda z plus F one sin hyperbolic lambda z, where E one, F one
are arbitrary constants 
Now, we remain to separate the function capital R and capital theta  So, in this step we are
again going to separate capital R, capital theta taking mu square as our separating constant 
So, the equation for capital theta becomes d two theta d theta square plus mu square
theta equals to zero and the equation in the variable capital R is written here d two R
equals to zero, where the constant, capital R alpha square is defined as lambda square
plus mu square 
Now, we are trying to find solution for capital R and capital theta  The theta equation gives
coordinate system is written in equation number one  We shall use the method of separation
﻿Today I am going to start module one of chapter  six  The chapter six is devoted to the theory of  
the total derivative which is equivalent to del  del t time derivative plus derivatives in space  
and neglecting the nonlinear terms we  get the equation which is written in  
equation number eleven, rho zero del v del  t equals to minus c square rho zero grad s   
Now, if we think about the continuity  equation, the continuity equation is given by  
DDT of rho plus rho divergence  of v equals to zero    
So in terms of small s and v and  neglecting the nonlinear terms  
to our first slide  As I have told that one of  the most important hyperbolic equation is the wave equation    
the continuity equation reduces to the form  which is written in equation number twelve,  
rho zero del s del t plus rho zero  divergence of v equals to zero   
Now for irrotational motion of the  gas there exists a scalar function phi  
such that the velocity v can be written  as gradient of the scalar function phi,  
so v is equal to minus grad of phi and if we  substitute this value of v in equation eleven  
which is shown here,  
it reduces to the form gradient of del phi  del t minus c square s is equal to zero    
del s del t equals to grad square phi which  is written in equation number fourteen   
Now eliminating s between the equations thirteen  and fourteen we obtain the wave equation which  
The wave equation is given by del two  phi del t square equals to c square grad square  
for sound waves in space we again get the wave  equation, three-dimensional wave equation    
The expression for these are written, you can see  in the slide and the tangential stress components  
we can see two constants lambda and  mu, they are known as Lame constants   
phi which is written in equation number one   And this c represent the wave speed   
Now, in absence of body force the equation of  motion can be written in the form del del x of tau  
If the displacement vector v is expressed  in the form v is equal to gradient of phi  
plus curve of psi  So displacement is divided  into two parts, one is the gradient curve  
and another one is the curled  curve  So if we substitute eighteen,  
in sixteen we get the equation del two phi del  t square equals to c one square grad square  
given by c one square equals to lambda plus two mu  by rho and c two square equals to mu by rho    
This c one and c two are known as longitudinal  and transverse wave speed respectively  So if  
Now if we assume a solution of equation one  in the form small phi equals to capital phi  
Now, I shall discuss how wave equation  can arise in electromagnetic problem   
Now, let us express the magnetic field capital H  and the electric field E in the form H as curl  
Now, the Maxwell equations are  given by these four equations  
which are written here, where rho is the charge,  i is the current and c is the velocity of light   
Now, if we substitute the expression  which is written in the first line,  
as you can see in the slide, grad  square A equals to one by c square  
one by c square del two phi del  t square minus four pi rho   
into e to the power i k c t that means  we are assuming a periodic solution  
Now, in absence of charges that means in the first  equation if i equals to zero the equation reduces  
to del two A del t square equals to c square  grad square A  And in the second equation  
phi satisfy the wave equation which is  written in equation number twenty    
Thus, in module one of chapter six we have  discuss about the occurrence of wave equation  
electromagnetic waves etcetera   Therefore, it is important to study  
in equation number two, grad square plus k  square phi equals to zero and this special  
equation is called Helmholtz's equation or  the space form of the wave equation    
Hyperbolic Differential Equation  Amongst  all hyperbolic equation the wave equation  
uniform tension capital T  The string, in the  equilibrium position, coincides with the x axis   
Let the string be disturbed slightly from  its equilibrium position and y which is  
function of x and t denotes the transverse  displacement from the equilibrium position    
Then this transverse displacement y will  satisfy the one-dimensional wave equation  
which is written in equation number  three, del two y del t square equals to c  
is the tension of the string and rho is  the uniform density of the string    
Suppose we want to solve this  problem together with the condition  
occurs most frequently in many physical problems   Chapter six is divided into five modules 
to solve the equation three together with the  boundary condition y a, t equals to zero   
whose axis coincides with the x axis such that  each point of a typical cross section of the bar  
takes the same displacement xi, then xi will  satisfy the one-dimensional wave equation  
is given by the Hooke’s law  The Hooke’s law  says that stress is proportional to strength,  
so which is written in this equation sigma  equals to E into del xi del x where del xi del x  
represent the strain and E is the proportionality  constant which is known as Young's modulus    
In  module one we shall discuss about the occurrence  of wave equation in many problems in physics    
We also assume that  
the bar for zero less than equals to x less  than equals to a is held at rest initially  
by the wave equation which is  written in equation number four    
Together with the initial condition xi equals  to zero and del xi del t is equal to zero  
at t equals to zero and for zero less  than equals to x less than equals to a  
and we have the boundary conditions  del xi del t equals to u, t  
at x equals to zero and del xi del  t equals to zero at x equals to a   
In module two we shall discuss about  solution of one-dimensional wave equation   
Thus, we need to solve wave equation four  together with the initial conditions  
which are written here and the boundary  conditions which are given in the last line    
Now, we are going to discuss how wave  equation can come in some electrical problem   
For this problem we consider the flow of  electricity in a long insulated cable so that the  
Then, the fall of potential in a linear element  delta x which is situated at a point small  
where R is the resistance per unit length and  capital L is the inductance per unit length    
Now if we divide this relation by delta x  and take the limit as delta x tends to zero,  
we get the differential equation  
In module three we shall discuss about  solution of two-dimensional wave equation  
Again for a capacitance C to earth and  conductance capital G per unit length,  
Again we are dividing this equation by delta  x and take the limit as delta x tends to zero,  
we obtain the differential equation  which is written in equation number six,  
and equation six we obtain a second-order  partial differential equation  
and in module four we shall discuss about the  solution of three-dimensional wave equation   
G equals to zero, then the above equation or  if we observe equation eight we can see that  
and this is nothing but one-dimensional wave  equation where the constant small c square  
is possible to get wave equation or a hyperbolic  differential equation in electrical problem    
Now we are going to discuss  about the sound waves problem,  
Lastly in module five we shall discuss about  general solution of a wave equation    
x such that each point of that section has  the same longitudinal displacement xi x, t,  
The suffix zero here denote the value  of dp d rho in equilibrium state    
therefore the above equation reduces to the  form del two xi del t square equals to c square  
del two xi del x square  This is again  a wave equation in one dimension   
p zero is the value of the pressure in equilibrium  state is equal to minus c square rho zero  
del xi del x where rho zero is the density  of the gas in the equilibrium state    
Firstly we shall discuss about occurrence of  wave equation in many problems in physics in  
is to be determined subject to the condition  del xi del x equals to zero at x equals to zero  
and x equals to a  So these are the boundary  conditions for this particular problem    
Now, we are going to discuss about sound  waves in space  Suppose the sound wave  
in a gas has the velocity v which has  components u, v, w at a point x y, z  
and p rho are the pressure density respectively   
s is the condensation of the gas and c square  equals to dp d rho at equilibrium state    
module one, for that discussion we need to  go to the slide show  So we are going now  
Now, we are going to start module two of chapter six  This module is devoted to the solution
From here, we got the expression if you take, if you observe the expression for capital
U we have chosen w as one, so for that this terms becomes zero del w del x, so capital
are going to slide presentation  The one dimensional wave equation is given by del two u del t
So, it is written here  So, it is written in equation number fifteen  Now, we have to integrate
x plus y is equals to x bar plus y bar, so for that, so for this characteristics the normal, this
is the angle between the normal to the characteristic with the x axis, so for that the cos of nx
becomes one by root two, cos of ny becomes one by root two and subsequently the value
of ds is minus root two dx and this is equals to minus root two dy 
So, substituting all these we get integration over AP del u del x cos nx minus del u del
y cos ny ds equals to minus integration A to P del u del x dx plus del u del y dy, so
Cauchy problem of one dimensional wave equation and we obtains this solution using Riemann’s
The derivation can be seen from the e-text of this module 
We have already used the method of separation of variable to find solution of different
all we shall solve this one dimensional wave equation using canonical transformation  From
differential equation  Now, we are going to use that method to find solution of one dimensional
wave equation in Cartesian coordinate system, plane polar coordinate system and spherical
polar coordinate system 
Now, we are going to our slide show  We have one dimensional wave equation and we are trying
to find the solution of that equation using separation of variables method  For that purpose
we write the solution u as product of two function capital X and tau where X and tau
are functions of small x and small t respectively  Now, substituting the expression for u from
Now, we separate the function capital X and capital tau in this way and to assume that
small k as our separation constant  In the first case we assume our separation constant
as some positive constant  So we assume k is equals to mu square where mu is a real number 
So, substituting that we obtain two separate equations for capital X and tau and
it is easy to solve both the equation and the solutions are given here capital X is
c one cos hyperbolic mu x plus c two sin hyperbolic mu x and tau is also linear combination of
cos function and sin function, hyperbolic functions 
in the second case we assume our separation constant as zero, then the equations for capital
X and tau becomes del two X del x square equals to zero del two tau del t square equals to
zero and the solution of this equations are capital X is c five x plus c six and tau is
equals to c seven t plus c eight, where c five, c six, c seven and c eight are constants 
are xi equals to x plus ct and eta equals to x minus ct 
So, the solution can be written as u is equals to these are product of capital X and capital
tau which is written in equation number nineteen  Now, in the last case we assume the separation
constant k as some negative number, so we assume k as minus mu square and the solution become
u equals to sum c nine cos mu x plus c ten sin mu x into c eleven cos c mu t plus
Now, I am going to discuss the solution in plane polar coordinates  The wave equation
in plane polar coordinate takes the form which is written in the equation number twenty one 
Now, in this equation we assume time periodic solution, so for that purpose we write the
solution in the form u is equal to capital R into e to the power i omega t 
So, substituting this expression for u in the equation twenty one, we obtain the equation
for capital R as d two R dr square plus one by r dR dr plus omega square by c square R
functions of order zero and of first kind and second kind respectively 
c one J zero omega r by c plus iY zero omega r by c plus c two into J zero omega
function, so capital R can be written as c one H zero one omega r by c plus c two H zero
two omega r by c 
and they are defined in this way which is written here  Therefore, in terms of Hankel’s
function the solution can be written as u is equals to c one H zero one plus c two H
coordinates system case where the equation wave equation can be written in the form which
is given in equation number twenty three 
so for that purpose we are writing u as some function capital R into e to the power i omega
t, so if you substitute this in twenty three the R equation becomes this d two R dr square
plus two by r dR dr plus omega square by c square R equals to zero  This is not Bessel
So, for that purpose we give a transformation which is shown here capital R is equals to
omega r by c to the power minus half into capital F  So, the equation in terms of capital
F becomes this  So, this is Bessel equation of order half, therefore its solution is the
of order half 
Now, in terms of capital R or the value of capital R can be written as capital R is one
the constant A and the constant B are define as A is equal to square root c by omega A
and the operator del del t is equivalent to del del xi minus del del eta 
dash and B is equal to square root c by omega B dash 
Now, you can note that the value of J half can be written in terms of sin function as
J half equals to square root two by pi x sin x and J minus half x is square root two by
omega r by c plus B cos omega r by c 
And the solution also can be written in complex form in this way, capital R equals to one
by r c one e to the power i omega r by c plus c two e to the power minus i omega r by c  So,
this is the solution of wave equation in spherical polar coordinate system 
of one dimensional wave equation  We have chosen one dimensional wave equation because
Therefore, in module two of chapter six, we obtain solution of one dimensional wave equation
using separation of variables method, it is to be motioned that the solutions obtain by
can be seen in our e-text  Thus, we end module two of chapter six 
trying to transform the equation from x t to xi eta 
it is easy to find solution of this equation  The general solution of this equation is u
psi into k times x minus ct is also a solution of the one dimensional wave equation, where
it is easy to handle and for some physical situation it is sufficient to consider the
plus minus omega t is called the phase of the traveling wave and the term x plus minus
ct are known as characteristics of the one dimensional wave equation 
In chapter four, we have seen that Cauchy type initial value problem is over determined
to find solution of a Laplace equation  But in case of wave equation Cauchy type initial
value problem gives an unique solution and that solution is called D’Alembert’s solution 
Now, in our next slide we're going to discuss about the D’Alembert’s solution of one
dimensional wave equation 
Suppose we have the Cauchy type initial value problem which is written by equation four
and five, equation four is nothing but one dimensional wave equation and equation five
problem as one dimensional problem  We shall solve one dimensional wave equation using
psi are arbitrary function 
Since phi and psi are arbitrary  Now we're using the initial condition, the first initial conditions
equals to phi plus psi, so in this equation we put t equals to zero so that gives phi
x plus psi x equals to eta x and the second initial condition, del u del t equals to nu
four different methods 
to nu x and these equation can be solved to get the solution which is written in equation
number seven 
So, solving that we get phi x minus psi x equals to one by c integration over zero to x nu
eta x minus one by two c integration zero to x nu xi d xi 
Firstly, we shall solve it using canonical transformation, in the second method, we shall
after simplification as u equals to half eta x plus ct plus eta x minus ct plus one by
to c integration x minus ct to x plus ct nu xi d xi  The solution which is written in
equation number nine is known as D’Alembert’s solution of the one dimensional wave equation 
In chapter three, we have already discuss the Riemann method or Greens function method to
find solution of a partial differential equation  There I mentioned that this method is very
important to find solution of a one dimensional wave equation  Now I am going to present how
Now, in wave equation we first give a transformation y is equals to ct and the equation reduces
to the form del two u del x square equals to del two u del y square  Suppose we have
the condition u is equals to eta x, y and del u del n equals to nu x, y on C that means
find the D’Alembert’s solution of wave equation, then we shall solve this equation
the value of the variable u and the normal derivative of u are prescribed on some curve C,
and let gamma is the projection of C on x  y plane 
Suppose, we have to find the value of u at some point x bar y bar of the wave function
u at the point P, and the characteristics of the equation ten through the point P are
The figure is shown here, so we are interested to find the value of u at the point P having
coordinated x bar y bar and the two characteristics are PA and PB and the value of u are prescribed
in the curve C, the C is shown here 
using the Riemann-Volterra method and lastly, we shall use the method of separation of variables
B, which you can see in this figure, this is the first line it intersects the curve
Now, think about the operator L which is del two del x square minus del two del y square 
So, here we have to find the solution of Lu equals to zero and you can easily verify that
this operator capital L is self-adjoin  Now we calculate this double integral over sigma
And this can be again written in this form del del x of w del u del x minus u del w del
this is the double integral or the surface integral  Now, this surface integral is equals
to find the solution of one dimensional equation 
Now, the Green’s function w must satisfy some conditions which are written here 
The w must satisfy Lw equals to zero and del w del n equals to zero on AP and BP,
First, we shall use canonical transformation to find the solution  For derivation now we
Now, I am going to start module three of chapter six  In this module, I shall discuss about
and the velocity del u del t at time t is equal to zero is given by the function g 
Since, the deflection is a single valued periodic function of theta of period two pi 
So, if we look at the solution, which is given in equation number five, since this is periodic
in theta, so value of these quantity will remain same, if we replace theta by two pi
plus theta so to get the same result, to make it periodic in theta, we should have lambda
is equals to some integer m  Therefore, we get the values of lambda as m, where m is
some integer 
to one by c square tau d two tau dt square 
Again, if we look at the solution which is written here, in this solution, we know that
the Bessel function of second kind which is denoted by Y lambda is undefined at R equals
So here, we have taken c two equals to zero  Now, if we use the boundary condition u at
r equals to a is equal to zero, that gives the equation Jm mu a equals to zero 
So, first we separate the function of t from the function of X and Y and to assume the
it is given that the value of u at time t is equal to zero is equal to f  So, that condition
b mn sin m theta and these condition can be obtained from the general solution putting
t is equal to zero, that means from this solution 
Now, in this solution, if you apply the initial condition del u del t is equal to g at time
separation constant as minus mu square to obtain a periodic solution  Now, the equation
mn, b mn, c mn and d mn 
and Fourier series  So, to obtain the values of a mn, we need to multiply the first
a for r and integrate over zero to two pi for theta and then using the orthogonality
property of Bessel function and the cosine function we can obtain the expression for
in spherical polar coordinate system  The wave equation in spherical polar coordinate
of variables method for that we are writing solution u as product of R theta and tau 
So, if you substitute u these expressions expression in seven, we obtain the expression
which is written in the last line  So, as usual, we first separate the function of t
that means tau, first and we have taken the expression to the right side and to get the
periodic solution, we assume the separation constant as a negative number minus mu square
where mu is a real constant 
separate the function capital X and capital Y in the last line one by X d two X dx square
at this equation, it is easy to find the solution of this equation, if we start from the tau equation,
the solution is combination of sin function and cosine function and solution
can be written here as tau is equal to some constant c five cos omega t plus c six sin
omega t, where omega is c into mu 
to the dependent variable capital R, it is possible to reduce the equation to Bessel
equation  So, this is the necessary transformation  So we use these transformation capital R equals
to small r to the power minus half into capital S  Now, the equation in terms of capital S
becomes which is shown here and these equation is known to us, this is famous Bessel equation
plus mu square equals to minus one by Y d two Y dy square is equal to lambda square
of order
R can be written as capital R is equal to Small r to the power minus half into Sr and
not in the standard form but if we do the substitution cos theta equals to mu dash,
in terms of mu dash the theta equation can be written in the form one by mu dash square
into d two theta d mu dash square minus two mu dash d theta d mu plus n into n plus one
say where lambda square is the another separating constant 
theta equals to zero and this is famous Legendre equation and we know the solution of Legendre
equation are
Now, in terms of theta the solution becomes capital theta is equal to c three Pn cos theta
plus c four Qn cos theta  And we have already got the solution for tau, which is written
in the last line 
So, the required solution can be written in the form which is given in equation number
nine, which is u is equal to r to the power minus half sum over n, this is linear combination
of Bessel function of first kind and second kind multiplied with the function of theta
capital theta plus tau  So, this is our required solution 
Thus, in module three of chapter six, we have derived the solution of two dimensional wave equations 
In Cartesian coordinate system, we found the solution is double Fourier series 
case of spherical polar coordinate system, the solution is mixed, Bessel and Legendre series 
Now, we end this module 
equals to mu square minus lambda square and q square equals to lambda square and the constant
solution of Two Dimensional Wave Equation in different coordinate systems  Those are
mu square is equals to p square plus q square 
constants and they are determined from the supplied initial and boundary conditions 
Therefore, the solution of two dimensional wave equation in Cartesian coordinate system
Now, we shall take one example, where we need to solve two dimensional wave equation in
Cartesian coordinate system together with some given initial and boundary conditions 
Cartesian coordinate system, plane polar coordinate system and spherical polar coordinate systems 
For that purpose we consider a physical problem where we consider the vibration of a membrane,
which is stretched between the lines x equals to zero, x equals to a, y is equal to zero
and y is equal to b 
And the initial condition is given by u at x equals to zero is equal to zero, u at x
equals to a is equal to zero, u at y is equal to zero is zero, and u at y is equal to b
So that is written here c one is equal to zero and if we use the condition u x zero
three equals to zero, so that is also written here c three equals to zero  We have two more
For all the cases, we shall use the method of separation of variables to find the solution 
initial conditions, which are u at x equals to a equals to zero, and u at y is equal to
b is equal to zero 
be equals to m into pi, where m is some integer  Or in other words, we can say that p is equals
to c into square root of p square plus q square  So, that equals to pi c into square root m
square by a square plus n square by b square 
values of these constants can be obtained using the other conditions  Now, we consider
that the membrane starts from rest with initial position f x y, that means, u is equal to
f x, y at time t is equal to zero and the velocity that means del u del t at time t
The wave equation in Cartesian coordinate system is written here del two u del t square equals to
So, from this expression, it is clear that it represent a double sin Fourier series 
Now, to obtain the coefficient A mn, we need to multiply both the sides of this expression
Or the required solution can be written in the
by b square 
c square del two u del x square plus del two u del y square  In separation of variables method
Now, we are going to find solution of two dimensional wave equation in plane polar coordinate
given by equation number four  Here we are using the same strategy means we are using
the separation of variables method to find the solution, for that purpose we are writing
the solution u as product of capital R capital theta and tau 
Then, we substitute the solution to equation four to obtain the relation which is written here,
theta d two theta d theta square equals to one by c square tau d two tau dt square 
So, first we're separating the function tau from the function of R and theta and to get the
periodic solution we are assuming the separation constant as a negative number, which is here
we write the solution u as product of capital X capital Y and tau
is minus mu square, so the equations becomes which is written in the last line 
Now, we are separating the function of R and theta and we are assuming the separating constant
as lambda square  So, assuming lambda square as our separation constant, we obtain the
plus mu square minus lambda square by r square capital R equals to zero and the theta equation
is given by d two theta d theta square plus lambda square theta equals to zero and the
equation for tau is d two tau dt square plus mu square c square tau equals to zero 
and we substitute the solution to equation one to obtain the expression which is written
c three cos lambda theta plus c four sin lambda theta 
Similarly, we can obtain the solution for tau as tau is equal to the linear combination
c two, c three, c four, c five, c six are arbitrary constants and the values of these
constants can be obtained from supplied initial and boundary conditions  Therefore, the required
solution of the two dimensional wave equation in plane polar coordinate system is u is equal
Now, we are going to discuss an example where we can use the solution of wave equation in
plane coordinate polar coordinate system together with some initial and boundary conditions 
in the next line one by x del two X del x square plus one by Y d two Y dy square equals
﻿Now, I am going to start module  four of chapter six  In this module,  
the theta equation is not familiar to  us, but if we do some substitution,  
that means if we put cos theta equals to  some variable mu and if we write the equation  
in terms of mu that means if we change  the independent variable from theta to mu,  
we shall obtain Legendre equation, rather  we can say that we will get an associated  
Legendre equation  So, it solution is the linear  combination of associated Legendre function    
If you give a transformation to the dependent  variable in such a way that capital R equals to  
r to the power minus half into capital S,  it can be shown that capital S will satisfy  
Bessel differential equation of order n  plus half  So, the general solution for  
where J and Y are Bessel function of first kind  and second kind and top order n plus half    
can be represented by the equation  given by equation number one    
Therefore, the solution capital R can be  written as capital R equals to r to the power  
minus half into S  Therefore, solution of wave  equation in spherical polar coordinate system  
can be written in the form, which you can  see in this slide  In the last section, we  
have discussed about solution of homogeneous wave  equation using separation of variables method    
But, it is also necessary to find solution of  inhomogeneous wave equation because these type  
of equation arises in electromagnetic theory  and other branches of mathematical physics   
Now, we shall use Duhamel’s principle to  find solution of inhomogeneous wave equation  
in terms of the homogeneous wave equation  Now,  we are going to our slide presentation    
In this section, I shall discuss Duhamel’s  principle for wave equation  Here, I shall show  
that how the solution of inhomogeneous wave  equation is related to the general solution of  
homogeneous wave equation  Consider the Euclidean  three dimensional space R three and a point x,  
y, z belongs to R three  Suppose, v is  function of x, y, z, t and lambda    
Lambda is some parameter which satisfies  the partial differential equation  
del two v del t square minus c  square napla square v equals to zero  
that means, v satisfies the homogeneous wave  equation together with initial conditions v,  
if you take the differentiation of u with respect  to t, so this is differentiation under the sin  
respectively  Now, substituting  this solution to equation one,  
lambda lambda t lambda, again differentiate  del u del t with respect to t again    
So, left hand side at del u delta t square, right  hand side is again differentiation under the sin  
of integration  So, the first element is del  v del t at the point lambda equals to t    
x, y, z, t minus lambda lambda d  lambda  And the value of del v del t  
Therefore, the value of del v del t at x,  y, z, zero, t is equals to capital F x, y,  
the value of del two v del t  square is c square napla square v  
we can substitute the value of del two v del  t square as c square napla plus square v,  
the differential operator with respect to x, y and  z  So, we can take out this differential operator  
minus lambda lambda d lambda  So, that is nothing  but u  So, in the next line we can write it as F  
x, y, z, t plus c square napla square u   Therefore, u satisfies the  
wave equation inhomogeneous wave equation,  which is written in equation number seven  
and you can prove that value of u at x, y,  z, zero is zero and del u del t at x, y, z  
zero is also zero  Therefore, the solution of wave  equation, not wave equation this is inhomogeneous  
wave equation can be written in terms of the  solution of the homogeneous wave equation,  
d two Y dy square plus one by Z d two Z  dz square equals to one by c square tau  
which is given by equation number six   In this way, we can find the solution of  
inhomogeneous wave equation that means, u  in terms of the solution of the homogeneous  
we have discussed about the solution  of three dimensional wave equation,  
we use separation of variables method to find  solution of homogeneous wave equation    
We have discussed three separate cases in  Cartesian coordinate system, the solution  
is mixed Fourier function  In case of  cylindrical coordinate system, we obtain  
mixed Bessel and Fourier function, where  as in case of spherical coordinate system,  
we obtained the solution as mixture of  Bessel, Legendre and Fourier function   
We have also derived the solution  of inhomogeneous wave equation  
d two tau dt square   So, first of all, we are  
using Duhamel principle  There we have shown how  to write solution of inhomogeneous wave equation  
separating the function of t from the function of  x, y and z  So, that's why we write the expression  
in t tau in the right hand side  Now,  to get a periodic solution, we assuming  
the separation constant as a negative number  so in this case, the value of the separation  
we shall discuss about solution of  three dimensional wave equation   
constant is minus omega square by c square   Now, using this separating constant,  
we again separate the function of z from the  function of x and y and that is written in the  
d two Z dz square minus omega square by c  square  We are assuming here the separation  
constant as n square  In the last line, we are  separating the function of x and function of y,  
which is written here, one by capital X d  two X dx square equals to minus one by Y d  
Therefore, all the equations for  capital X, capital Y, capital Z and tau  
can be expressed in the form  which can be seen in this slide   
The module is divided into two section,  in first section we shall find solution of  
at the equation for capital Y, its  solution is also linear combination  
of sin function and cosine function   So, the solution for y can be written as capital Y  
is equals to c five cos rz plus  c six sin rz and the solution for  
tau can be written as tau equals to c  seven cos omega t plus c eight sin omega t   
And it is clear from the solution that  it is periodic with respect to time  
and its period is two pi by omega   So, the solution of the  
original equation or the three dimensional wave  equation can be written as u is equal to capital X  
into capital Y into capital Z into tau  which is given here in equation number two,  
where the constants p, q, r z, r  omega are given by the equation  
wave equation using separation of variables  method and in the second section we shall use  
q square equals to n square minus p square r  square equals to omega square by c square minus  
n square and p square plus q square plus r  square equals to omega square by c square    
Now, we are trying to find the solution of  wave equation in cylindrical coordinate system   
The wave equation in cylindrical coordinate  system can be expressed as it is given in equation  
del u del r plus one by r square del two u del  theta square plus del two u del z square    
Now, to apply the separation of variables method  we write the solution u as product of capital R,  
capital theta, capital Z and tau and we  substitute the solution to equation three  
r square theta d two theta d theta square  plus one by Z d two Z dz square equals to  
Duhamel’s principle to find solution of  in homogeneous wave equation  Now, we are  
one by c square tau d two tau dt square   So first we're separating the time variable  
and we are assuming the separation constant  as minus omega square by c square to obtain  
a periodic solution of the given equation  Now,  using that separation constant, in the next line  
separating constant minus n square   Again, we're separating the function of  
going to the slide presentation for deriving the  solution using separation of variables method    
the equations for r theta z tau can be written  in the form which you can see in this slide    
So, if you observe the tau equation so it's  very easy to find solution of this equation   
So, its solution is a linear combination of sin  function and cosine function  So, this is periodic  
with period two pi by omega  So, the solution for  tau is tau equals to some constant c seven cos  
Now, if you look at the theta equation, its  solution is again a linear combination of sin  
r dR dr plus n square minus m square by r  square into capital R equals to zero and  
I have already discussed the method of separation  of variables to find solution of Laplace equation,  
this is famous Bessel equation of order m   So, its solution is a linear combination of  
Therefore, the solution of wave equation in  cylindrical coordinate system is given by  
u equals to capital R into capital  theta into capital Z into tau  
which you can see in equation number four   And in this solution, the constants  
these constants can be obtained from the initial  and boundary condition of the given problem   
Now, I am going to discuss the solution of wave  equation in spherical polar coordinate system,  
the wave equation in spherical polar coordinate  system is given by equation number five    
heat equation and also wave equation in  one dimension and two dimension 
As usual, we are assuming the solution u as  product of four functions capital R, capital  
theta, phi and tau where these are function of  small r, small theta, small phi and t respectively   
So, substituting this solution to the original  equation phi, we obtain the relation which  
you can see in the last line   So, first of all we are separating  
the solution is time periodic, so the separation  constant is taken as a negative number   
So, that separation constant for this  problem is minus omega square by c square   
So, using that separating constant  
we then separate the function of phi  from the function of r and theta    
So, in the first line you can see that we are  separating phi from the other two variables r and  
Now, I am going to apply this method to find solution  in three dimensional Cartesian coordinate system   
theta and we are assuming the separation constant  as m square  Now, using this separation constant  
in the next line we are separating the  function of r and function of theta and  
the separation constant for this case is n  into n plus one  Now, all the equations means,  
the equation for capital R, capital theta, capital  phi and tau are given by these four equations    
So, if you observe these equations, so  let us first start with the tau equation   
So, from tau equation you can see  that the solution is periodic in time   
and if you look at the phi equation, a solution  is also the linear combination of sin function  
and cosine function  So, capital phi is equals  to c five cos m phi plus c six sin m phi    
Now, if we look the theta equation,  
The wave equation in Cartesian coordinate system  
Today I am going to start chapter seven  This chapter is devoted to the solution of partial
one and this is valid for real p greater than minus one 
to one divided by two pi i integration gamma minus i infinity to gamma plus i infinity
there is a pole of the function at the point p is equal to minus one  So value of the integral
is is equal to residue at the pole p is equal to minus one and we can calculate the residue 
Its value becomes e to the power minus x 
So applying inverse Laplace transform, we are getting back our original function e to
as fx equals to one divided by two pi integration minus infinity to plus infinity f bar p e
and in the same module we shall define inverse integral transform  In module two, we shall
transform and then again inverse Fourier transform  And we shall show that we can get we will
get the original function  So for that, we take the function e to the power mod x  The
Fourier transform of this function is f bar equals to integration zero to infinity e to
power minus one minus ip x dx plus integration minus infinity to zero e to power one plus
ip into x dx  The first integral gives one divided by one minus ip, and the value of
the second integral is one divided by one plus ip  So after simplification, the expression
for f bar p becomes two divided by one plus p square 
Now the inverse formula or the inverse Fourier transform of this f bar p is fx equals to
one by pi integration minus infinity to plus infinity e to the power ixp by one plus p square dp 
show some application of Laplace transform to find solution of a differential equation 
So, if we evaluate that integral we will get its value as e to the power minus
x for x greater than zero and its value is equals to e to the power x for x less than
zero  So combining these two results, we can say that fx equals to e to the power minus mod x 
Inverse formula for Fourier sine and cosine transform are defined as- Inverse Fourier
Fourier cosine transform is defined as fx equals to two by pi integration zero to infinity
f bar p cos xp dp 
If fx equals to minus x then its sine transform is integration zero to infinity e to the power
minus x into sin px dx  So after integration, we get its value is equal to p divided by
one plus p square  If you take the cosine transform of the same function e to the power
In module three, we shall give application of Fourier integral transform  In module four,
minus x, we obtain integration zero to infinity e to the power minus x cos px dx is equals
to one divided by one plus p square 
of the given function e to the power minus x  Now if we apply inverse sine function of
this function, then value of fx is equals to two by pi integration zero to infinity
can say that it is possible to get back the original function a for using the inverse
sine transformation 
In the similar way, a it is also possible to find the original function if we apply
the inverse cosine transformation  So for to establish that, now we are taking the transform
we shall give application of Mellin transform and Henkel transform  And lastly in module
variable f bar p as one by one plus p square  So this is nothing but cosine transformation
of the function e to the power minus x  Now, we are applying inverse cosine transformation
to this function  So fx is equals to two by pi integration zero to infinity one by one
both sine transformation and cosine transformation, and then applying inverse of sine transformation
and inverse of cosine transformation, it is possible to get back the original function 
Now I am going to define inverse Henkel transformation  The inverse Henkel transformation is defined
Henkel transformation of this fx is given by f bar p is equals to integration zero to
five, we shall discuss the application of finite integral transform to find solution
Now, if we apply inverse Henkel transformation to one by p, we get fx equals to integration
zero to infinity one by p into p Jn xp dx  And after integration we are getting our original
function one by x 
This is inverse Mellin transformation  It is defined as fx equals to one divided by
two pi i integration gamma minus i infinity gamma plus i infinity f bar p x to the power
minus p dp for x greater than zero  fx, for this transformation we are using the function
e to the power minus x  And the henk- Mellin transformation of e to the power minus x is
f bar p equals to integration zero to infinity e to the power minus x x to the power x minus
p minus one dx  This is the, the famous gamma function so its value is gamma p 
of a partial differential equation 
Now, we are using inverse Mellin transformation to get the value of fx  And so value of fx
is one divided by two pi i integration gamma minus i infinity to gamma plus i infinity
gamma p x to the power minus p dp  And here we are using the formula gamma p into gamma
one minus p equals to pi divided by sin pi p  And using that formula, we can get back
Now, I am showing some important results on integral transform  So, these are the results
regarding Laplace transform  The first one you can see this is this gives the Laplace
transform of the any nth order derivative of a function f  So its value equals to p
to the power n f bar p minus p to the power n minus one f zero minus p to the power n
minus two f dash zero dot dot minus f n minus one zero, where f bar p denotes the Laplace
So, first of all, I am going to start module one of this chapter  For that we need to go
transform of the function fx 
is linear  So Laplace transform of c one f one plus c two f two plus c n fn equals to
Laplace transforms of f one, f two, fn respectively 
The third result this is called the scaling property which shows that Laplace transform of
function of alpha x equals to one by alpha f bar p by alpha  And the third fourth one
this is the shifting property  So Laplace transform of e to the power minus lambda x
fx is equals to f bar lambda plus p  And the next property which shows that Laplace transform
of f x minus x dash into H x minus x dash is equals to e to the power minus p x dash
to the slide presentation  We define integral transform of a function fx by the integral
into f bar p, where Hx is the heavy side function 
And the next result which is known as convolution theorem or convolution property which shows
that if f one p is the Laplace transform of the function f one and f two p is the Laplace
transform of the function f two, then f one into f two f one bar into f two bar is equal to
Laplace transform of the function phi x where phi x is given by integration zero to
x f one x dash into f two x minus x dash dx dash or it may be written in this way zero
to x f one x minus x dash into f two x dash dx dash 
And the last result it shows the Laplace transform of an integral  So if phi x is the is a function
integration zero to x fx dash dx dash, then Laplace transform of phi x is equal to one
by p f bar p 
And this is the table of some Laplace transforms and all these results can be derived easily 
And the similarly, we can show some properties of Fourier transform  So,
if F denotes the Complex Fourier transform of the function small f, then the Fourier transform
of the nth derivative of the function f is given by minus ip to the power n f bar p,
where f bar p is the Complex Fourier transform of the function small fx 
And the second result it shows the linear property of Fourier transform  And the third
power iap into f bar p  And the fourth property gives the mth order derivative of f p is equals
limits of this integration may be finite or infinite  The function k, which is function
differential equation using integral transform  The study of integral transform has been started
of Fourier transforms  So, using the definition of Fourier transform, we can establish these
results easily 
Thus, in module one of chapter seven, we have defined integral transform  We have also defined
Inverse integral transform  We defined four different type of integral transforms  Those are Laplace transform, Fourier transform,
Mellin transform and Henkel transform  We illustrate integral
transform taking some examples  Taking some functions we applied integral transform 
Then we applied inverse integral transform and we showed that it is possible to get back
the original function  Now, we end module one of chapter seven 
finite, f bar p is termed as finite transform of the function fx 
Laplace transform of the function fx is defined as f bar p equals to integration zero to infinity
fx e to the power minus px dx  So in Laplace transformation, the value of a is finite,
that the Laplace transform of the function fx exist if fx is continuous or piecewise
in nineteenth century when Laplace Fourier discovered Laplace transform, Fourier integral transform,
Now I am going to define Fourier integral transform, which is given by equation number
fx must satisfy Dirichlet's condition in minus infinity to plus infinity  It is to be mentioned
that Dirichlet's condition means fx should satisfy the two conditions, one of them is
fx must have finite number of finite discontinuity within any finite interval within minus infinity
And the next and second condition to fx is fx must be absolutely integrable
within the interval minus infinity to plus infinity  So if fx satisfies these two conditions, Dirichlet's
etcetera  The integral transform is very easy and effective method 
In the similar way, we can define Fourier sine or cosine transform  The transformation
is given in equation number four  The Fourier sine transformation is given by integration
zero to infinity fx into sine px dx whereas Fourier cosine transformation is given by
integration zero to infinity fx cos px dx 
There is another popular transformation which is known as Henkel transformation
jnpx is the Bessel function of first kind and of order n where n is greater than minus half 
number one, fr equals to order of r to the power minus k as r going to infinity
This method is used to find solution of differential equation and integral equation 
subinterval of zero infinity 
There is one another popular transformation which is known as Mellin transformation where
finite interval in zero infinity 
In the last section, we have defined four different types of integral transformations 
They are Laplace transform, Fourier transform, Henkel transform and Mellin transform 
In practice, we use integral transform to find solution of a differential equation 
Suppose we have a differential equation in which U is our dependent variable and t is one of
In this chapter our motivation is to find solution of differential equation particularly
the independent variable  Using integral transform, we transform one of the independent variable,
say the t variable, to another variable, let the transform variable is p  And
the transform dependent variable is U bar 
find the solution for U bar compared to the solution for U  So after getting the equation
for U bar, we try to solve to find the value of U bar as function of p  After getting U
bar as function of p, we need to apply inverse integral transform to find the value of U
as function of t  That’s why it is important to know the inverse integral transform together
with integral transform 
Now, in this section, we are going to discuss about inverse integral transform in our slide
partial differential equation using integral transform  We shall use most commonly used
presentation  The inverse Laplace transform is defined as fx equals to one divided by
two pi i integration over gamma minus i infinity to gamma plus i infinity f bar p into e to
the power px dp  And fx equals to zero for x less than zero 
So if you observe the integral, this is a contour integral and f bar p is a complex
valued function in general  The value of the integral depends on the nature of the function
a single valued function, it may have finite number of poles or infinite number of poles 
p is equal to gamma 
integral transform namely Laplace transform, Fourier integral transform, Mellin transform
Generally, this line is closed by an arc of a circle which is represented by gamma in the figure 
the line capital R in such a way that all the poles of the function f bar p lies on
the left of the line  And it can be shown that the value of the integral over the circular
arc gamma as capital R tends to infinity is zero  Therefore, the value of the integral
which is written in equation number seven is equals to one divided by two pi i integration
gamma minus i infinity to gamma plus i infinity f bar p e to the power px dp  It is evaluated
along the line capital L 
different way  So in either case, if it has it is a single valued function or it has some
and Henkel transform to find solution of partial differential equation 
branch point, the value of the integral is to be evaluated using Cauchy's residue theorem,
which says that, the value of the integral one divided by two pi i integration fp e to
Now, I am taking one example, where we shall show that we shall first use Laplace transform
to transform the function fx to the function f bar p  Then we shall use inverse Laplace
transform to get back the original function fx that means e to the power minus x  So we
are taking, for example, here the function e to the power minus x  The Laplace transform
of this function by definition is f bar p equals to integration zero to infinity e to
the power minus x e to the power minus px dx  So, this is integration zero to infinity
e to the power minus p plus one x dx  So after integration, it gives one divided by p plus
The entire chapter is divided into five modules  In module one, we shall define integral transform
We know that many problems of physical interest are described by ordinary differential equation
two equation, that gives the trivial solution, A equals to zero and B equals to zero  Therefore,
from the general solution which satisfies the given boundary condition, we
plus pi square c square by l square  Now, to get back the function u or the variable u
as function of t, we apply inverse Laplace transform and we obtain the solution as u
In the previous problem, we have considered non-homogeneous initial condition and homogeneous
boundary condition  In the present problem we are solving the same problem, wave equation,
but for this case the initial conditions are homogeneous whereas the boundary conditions
system is given by del u del t equals to kappa del two u del x square, where x greater than
are non-homogeneous  So, the given equation is del two u del t square equals to c square
del two u del x square where x lies between zero and l, t greater than zero and the initial condition
u x, zero equals to zero and del u del t at t equals to zero is zero and the
boundary conditions are u zero, t equals to a sin omega t and u l, t equals to zero 
So, if you take the Laplace transform of the given equation, we obtain the same equation
which is written in the first line of this slide  And if we put the values of u x, zero
to p square u bar where p is the transformed variable and u bar is the Laplace transform
to A e to the power px by c plus B e to the power minus px by c 
zero and t is greater than zero  And we are also looking for the solution which is bounded
Now, we need to find the values of A and B  So to find the values of A and B, we need
to apply the boundary conditions  So if we look back, the boundary condition, it is given
that u at the point x equals to zero, t equals to A sin omega t and u at x equals to l equals
to zero  So if we apply Laplace transform to this condition, the condition becomes,
conditions gave the equation A plus B equal to a omega by p square plus omega square and
A e to the power pl by c plus B e to the power minus pl by equals to zero  And solving these
two equations, we can obtain the values of A and B which are written here 
Now, if we substitute the values of A and B in the general solution, that means in the
expression for u bar, we can get the functional value of u bar or the expression for u bar
which is written here a omega by p square plus omega square sin hyperbolic p into l
minus x by c divided by sin hyperbolic pl by c 
And we know the formula for inverse Laplace transform is u x, t equals to one divided
by two pi i integration gamma minus i infinity to gamma plus i infinity e to the power pt
into u bar xp dp  This is a contour integration  Now to evaluate this contour integration,
we need to think about the function u bar and if you look at this function, the function
u bar has singularities at the point where p square plus omega square equals to zero
or in other words, it has singularities at the point p equals to plus minus i omega 
equals to zero and it satisfies the boundary condition u zero t equals to some function
It also has singularities at the point where sine hyperbolic pl by c equals to zero 
Therefore, the function u bar has singularities at this point p is
equal to plus minus i omega and p is equal to plus minus i pi n c by l  And all the singularities
are simple poles 
Therefore, u x, t can be written as sum of the residues at these simple poles  So, we
have denoted the residues in this form where R zero plus, R zero minus are the residues
of e to the power pt u bar at p is equal i omega and p is equal to minus i omega respectively 
that means e to the power pt into u bar at p equals to i pi nc by l and p equals to minus
of t which is equals to ft here 
i pi nc by l respectively 
this slide  The first expression gives the residue of e to the power pt into u bar at the point p
is equal to i omega  And the second expression it gives the residue of the function
e to the power pt into u bar at the point p is equal to minus i omega  And after simplification,
the value of R zero plus plus R zero minus becomes this which you can see in the last
line of this slide 
And the similarly, we can find the value of Rn plus, this is the residue of the function
are calculated here using Cauchy's residue theorem and this is the simplification which
its value is which is given here two a omega c l by omega square l squared minus n square
pi square by c square sin n pi x by l into sin n pi c t by l 
Therefore the required solution of the given differential equation is this  u x, t equals
to this is the residue at p is equal to plus minus i omega  That means this is R zero plus
plus R zero minus and this is the expression for Rn plus plus Rn minus 
is homogeneous and boundary condition is non- homogeneous  Thus in module two of chapter
seven, we have learnt how to find solution of heat equation and wave equation using Laplace
transformation  The Laplace transformation can be applied to find solution of other differential
equation which are linear  Not only that, these transformation can be applied to find
solution of integral equation and difference equation  Now, we end this module 
where u bar is the transformed variable or dependent variable  That means u is transformed
or partial differential equation together with initial or boundary values 
to the variable u bar and the independent variable t is transformed to the variable p 
Therefore, now u bar is function of x and p only 
to ft  So if we apply Laplace transform to this condition, that will give u bar zero
our problem becomes we have to solve an ordinary differential equation which is given by d
linear second order differential equation  And we have to solve this equation together
with the initial condition u bar zero p equals to f bar p 
These type of problems are called initial value problem or boundary value problem or mixed
A into e to the power minus square root p by kappa into x plus B into e to the power
we assume the value of the constant capital B as zero  Therefore, the solution becomes
We also have the boundary condition u bar zero p equals to f bar  So if we use this
is e to the power minus square root p by kappa into x 
initial-boundary value problem  The method of Laplace transformation is used to find solution of these type of
t  Now, to apply inverse transform to u bar, you can notice that u bar is product of two
functions  So, to get back u as function of t, we need to apply convolution theorem  So
to apply convolution theorem, we need to know the inverse transformation of f bar as well
the inverse transformation of g bar  In this case, the inverse transformation of f bar
p is ft  It is known to us 
But we need to find inverse transformation of g bar p, where g bar is given by the exponential
function which is written here  But, its not easy to find the inverse transformation of
these exponential function thats why we write g bar in this form p into one by p e to the
power minus square root p by kappa into x which is equals to p into h bar p, where
h bar p is one by p into e to the power minus square root p by kappa into x  We write the
problems  The method of Laplace transformation is used to solve linear system of equations 
equation in this form because the inverse transformation of h bar p can be obtained
easily which is shown here 
The inverse transformation of h bar p which is denoted by ht is equals to Laplace inverse
transformation of one by p e to the power minus square root p by kappa into x and its
value is complementary error function with argument x by two into square root kappa into
t becomes p into h bar p  Therefore, Laplace inverse transformation of
the value h dash t which is written here 
Thus, in module two of chapter seven, we shall discuss about how to find solution of a differential
Consequently, we can find the value of L inverse g bar p is equal to x by two t square root
pi kappa t e to the power minus x square four kappa t  That equals to gt say  Now, if we
go back to the expression for u bar, the value of u bar is product of f bar into g bar where
inverse Laplace transformation of f bar and g bar are known to us 
Now, we apply convolution theorem to find the value of u as u is equal to integration
tau, so if we substitute these values, we get the expression which is written here 
So, this is our required solution 
The physical problem is described by, which is written here there is a string which is stretched
equation using Laplace transform  In this module we shall solve one dimensional heat
the displacement of the string in the form u is equal to lambda sin pi x by l and we
also assume that the string is released from rest at time t is equal to zero 
And we want to find the displacement of any point on the string at any time t 
Therefore, displacement will satisfy the wave equation which is written here del two u del t square
equals to c square del two u del x square, where zero less than x less than l and t is
greater than zero  And we have also the initial condition u x, zero equals to lambda sin pi
x by l and del u del t at time t equals to zero is zero  We have also the boundary conditions
u zero, t equals to u l, t equals to zero 
Now we take Laplace transform of the given equation  So, if you look at the equation,
equation and wave equation using Laplace transformation method 
we are taking Laplace transform with respect to the variable t  So, left hand side is equals
right hand side is equals to c square d two u bar del d x square 
of del u del t is zero  So if you substitute these values, the first equation can be written
This is not homogeneous  So, the general solution of this problem is given by u bar equals to
complimentary function plus particular integral  Now the complimentary function of the homogeneous
Now, we are going to our slide presentation  First we shall solve one dimensional heat
plus pi square c square by l square 
So, this is the general solution of the in-homogeneous ordinary differential equation, where A and
B are arbitrary constants  Now, we have to find the values of A and B using the supplied
condition  Now to find the values of A and B, we need to apply the boundary conditions 
From the given boundary conditions, we apply Laplace transform to get u bar zero, p equals
to zero and u bar l, p equals to zero  if we use the first boundary condition, we obtain
A plus B equals to zero and if we use the second boundary condition we obtain A e to
the power p l by c plus B e to the power minus p l by c equals to zero  Now, if we solve these
equation using Laplace transformation method  The heat equation in Cartesian co-ordinate
Now, I am going to start Module three of chapter seven  This module deals with application
x tends to infinity, it follows that B is equal to zero because in this expression,
So, B cannot be a non-negative or nonzero number  So, the only option is b is equal to zero 
mod xi T divided by mod xi  If you apply this condition  This gives the value of capital
A as two u zero into sin mod xi T by mod xi 
So, substituting this value of A, now our required solution becomes u bar equals to
two u zero sin mod xi T by mod xi, e to the power minus x square root mod xi by two kappa,
We have also the initial condition for u, u at t equal to zero is equal to f x and we
one minus i  So, this is the solution for xi greater than zero  Similarly, for xi less
than zero, we can obtain the solution in the form u bar equals to two u zero sin mod xi
T divided by mod Xi e to the power minus x square root mod xi by two kappa into one plus
i 
is the formula of inverse Fourier Transform  So, u x, t equals to one divided by two pi
integration minus infinity to plus infinity u bar e to the power minus i xi t into d xi 
Now, we break the interval into two parts, one is for negative values of xi and the other
is for positive values of xi 
So, in these two intervals, we substitute the values of u bar and substituting these
xi, e to the power minus x square root mod xi by two kappa into e to the power i, x into
square root mod xi by two kappa minus xi t plus e to the power minus i x into square
root mod xi by two kappa minus xi T  And these can be simplified to cosine function 
So, in the next line, the term can be replaced by cosine function, which can be seen in this
in Cartesian coordinate system, del two u del t square equals to c square del two u
del x square where x has infinite range and t is greater than zero  And we have also the
initial condition u at t equals to zero is f x  And del u del t at t equals to zero is
g x and we also have u and del u del x tends to zero as mod x tends to infinity 
respect to x  So, after taking Fourier transform, the equation becomes d two u bar dt square
constants  Now, to obtain the values of these arbitrary constants, we need to apply the
Now, if we apply these two condition in the general solution, we obtain A plus B equals
complex Fourier transform of the given equation with respect to variable x  So, we multiply
equals to half f bar plus i by xi c g bar 
So, substituting the values of A and B in the general solution here, we obtain u bar
as half f bar into e to the power i xi ct plus e to the power minus i xi ct minus i
We need to find the value of u, as function of x and t  So, to obtain u, this is a time
to take the inverse Fourier Transform of u bar  Thus, we take inverse Fourier Transform
of u bar  So, u is equal to one by two pi minus infinity to plus infinity u bar xi t
e to the power minus xi x d xi 
the Laplace equation with e to the power i xi x and then integrate over x from minus
know the expression for fx, this is the inverse Fourier Transform of f bar xi 
So, f x equals to one by two pi integration minus infinity to plus infinity f bar xi e
to the power minus i xi x dxi  So in this expression, if you take the argument of f
as x minus ct, so, value of f x minus ct is equals to one by two pi minus infinity to
plus infinity f bar e to the power minus xi into x minus ct  So, x will be replaced by
x minus ct in this expression  Similarly, the value of f x plus ct can be obtained from
infinity to plus infinity 
the expression of fx by replacing x by x plus ct 
Fourier Transform of g bar  So, g eta is equals to one by two pi minus infinity to plus infinity
And this is the expression for g eta  So, this equals to one by two pi minus infinity
by two pi  Now we interchange the order of integration  So, it's minus infinity to plus
And we can find the value of this integral and value of this integral becomes here, which
The first term gives minus xi square u bar xi, y and the second term is plus integration
is written here, e to the power minus i xi into x minus ct minus e to the power minus
Thus, it is possible to find the D'Alembert solution of wave equation using Fourier transform method 
Thus, in Module three of chapter seven, we have learned how to find solution of Laplace
equation, heat equation and wave equation using complex Fourier transformation 
There is also sine Fourier transformation and cosine Fourier transformation, which can be applied
minus infinity to plus infinity d to u d y square e to the bar, i xi x, dx equals to
applied to find solution of integral equation  It has application in statistics also 
This method is very useful to find frequency of a signal in electrical engineering 
Now, we end this module 
of Fourier transform to partial differential equation  In this regard, I want to mention
which is given by the integration, in this integral if we interchange the differential
and integral operator, then it gives d to d y square of integration minus infinity to
plus infinity u into e to the power i xi x, dx  So, that is nothing but u bar 
So, the second term in the expression is d to u bar d y square and the first term is minus xi
square u bar equals to zero 
Now, this is the resultant equation  So, this is an ordinary
power xi into y plus B into e to the power minus xi into y, where A and B are arbitrary
the power xi y, for xi less than zero  Thus, for any xi we can write the solution in the
form u bar is equal to C into e to the power minus mod xi into y 
to the solution, u bar equals to C to the power minus mod xi y, this gives, the value
required solution u bar, which is function of xi and y, is equal to f bar xi into e to
the power minus mod xi into y 
Mellin transformation, Hankel transformation can be defined in terms of complex Fourier transformation 
for u bar we need to apply inverse Fourier Transform to find u as function of x and y 
u bar  So, the formula is written here, u is equal to one by two pi integration minus
And we have also substituted the value of f bar xi, which is written here minus infinity
in the next line, this is equals to one by two pi minus infinity to plus infinity f eta, d eta
x minus mod xi into y, d xi 
Therefore, it is relevant to discuss about the application of Fourier transform to partial differential equation 
and the value of the second integral is one divided by eta minus x whole square
Now, we shall consider heat conduction equation and we shall apply complex Fourier transform
to find solution of this equation  So, the given equation is the heat equation, one dimensional
heat equation in Cartesian coordinate system, which is given by equation one, del u del
t equals to kappa del two u del x square where x lies between zero to infinity 
And this equation is satisfied with the given condition  This is the boundary condition u at x equals
to zero t cause to u zero for mod t less than capital T and equals to zero for mod t greater
than capital T  And we also have the solution is bounded 
In this module, we shall solve the Laplace equation, heat equation
That means, u tends to zero as x going to infinity and mod t going to infinity  Thus,
we have to solve the conduction equation together with the condition which are given by two
Since t has range from minus infinity to plus infinity, we are taking Fourier transform with respect
to t  So, for that reason, we are multiplying the equation by, e to the power i xi t and
then integrate over minus infinity to plus infinity  The first term, if we look at the
left-hand side of this expression, we're applying in the next line we are applying the integration
by <?> first<?>  So, for that we are assuming e to the power i xi t as our first function 
So, according to that rule first function into integration of second function that is
u over minus infinity to plus infinity minus integration of derivative of first function 
and wave equation using Fourier transformation method  Now, we are going to slide show 
So, that gives, e to the power i xi t into i xi  And integration of second function that
is u dt is equal to the right-hand side  Here, we again interchange the operator integration
If you look back the condition three, u tends to zero as x tends to infinity and mod t tends
to infinity  So, if we apply that, we get the term in the square bracket is zero 
So, this term is zero and the second term is minus i xi into This is nothing but Fourier transform
of u with respect to t  For this problem, we are denoting that by u bar  So, left hand
in this form also D two u bar dx square plus i xi dy by kappa u bar equals to zero 
First, we shall start with Laplace equation, the Laplace equation in Cartesian coordinate system
Now, this is a second order ordinary differential equation in x  And the solution of this equation
this condition, condition two, this is the boundary condition 
So, if we apply Fourier transform to that, it gives u bar zero, xi is equal to integration
the value of u is u zero within the interval minus T two plus T  So, outside
that interval the value of the integral becomes zero  So, the limits of the integration become minus
T to plus T 
is given by del two u del x square plus del two u del y square equals to zero  Here we have
So, after integration we get its value is equals to two u zero sin xi t divided by xi,
is applicable for both xi greater than zero and xi less than zero  Now, if we look at
condition if we apply Fourier transform, we obtain u bar x, xi goes to zero as x goes to infinity 
root mod xi by two kappa into one minus i plus B e to the power x into square root mod
sin by two kappa into one minus i  Now, using the condition u bar x xi tends to zero as
considered infinite range for x and y is greater equals to zero 
Welcome participants 
is calculated separately for each financial year ,
with the rules that even if it is broken year it will end on 31st March
of that particular year, and accordingly the previous year
and assessment year will be calculated 
So thus one particular year has nothing to do with the second year as far as the
total calculations are concerned 
It is standalone calculations will be there for each year 
So thus income tax is an annual tax  The tax rate,
which would be applicable, actually relates to the assessment year tax rate 
Suppose I'm earning the income my previous year is 2018-19 
Today, let us discuss the basis of charge 
, while I calculate the income tax on my income
of the previous year 2018-19 I will refer to be tax rates
which are proposed or which are available
for the year or applicable for the year 2019-20 assessment year 
So the tax rate of assessment year is applicable 
Next, the rates are fixed by the finance act 
What is the finance act  Every year nowadays on February one
that is the first day of February, the union finance minister
presents the union budget  The budget
is accompanied by a finance bill 
As provided under Section four of the Income Tax Act 
, when the finance bill is debated in the parliament,
and it is passed by the parliament
it becomes a finance act  It is a common feature
that every year the union finance minister presents the tax rates
in the finance bill itself  , you get the tax rates for
each assessment year as suggested by the finance act of that particular year 
Tax is charged on person, we have already defined
that who are the person as we have defined in includes an individual,
a farm, a company, an HOF,
an association of persons or body of individual, a local authority
This is the premise on which the Income Tax Act is bill 
or any artificial juridical person 
So income tax is payable by the person  It is a tax on total income 
<PETSo</PET>, there is no term called taxable income or something like that 
The income tax that defines total income how it is calculated 
In my previous discussion, we have already seen what is the total income 
May I repeat, total income is calculated by deducting the deductions
available under Section 80 C to 80 U
from the gross total income  what is gross total income 
Gross total income is the aggregate of all five heads of income 
, just to explain again, when all five heads of income are aggregated
Section four talks on the basic infrastructure, basic premise
we get the gross total income  From the gross total income
we deduct the deductions available under Section 80 C to 80 U,
and then we get the total income  On this total income,
income tax is chargeable, and the income tax rate is fixed by the finance Act
and the tax rates that are applicable for that particular assessment year 
Provisions as on April one of the assessment year are applicable 
That's why the union budget
accompanies the finance bill and in the Finance Act
the changes in the income tax rate have some provisions are mentioned 
And accordingly the rules for assessment year are applicable
on which the entire Income Tax Law is made 
to that particular previous year 
, just to summarize again, how to compute the total income 
We first calculate the income from salaries,
income from house property, profits and gains of business and profession,
capital gains and income from other sources 
If there is any set up for carry foreward classes,
that is also adjusted and ultimately we get the gross total income 
From the gross total income, we make the deductions
which are available under Section 80C to 80U 
And we get the total income which is liable to income tax </p>
Let us see the features as referred by section four of the Income Tax Act 
, how the tax liability is computed 
The total income is already calculated, will calculate the tax on total income
by charging the applicable rates
which are there for the relevant assessment year,
will deduct the rebate under Section 87 A 
We get income tax after rebate under Section 87 A 
If there is any surcharge, will add the surcharge, surcharge is applicable
in specified cases  We get the tax and surcharge 
There is an education cess which is applicable 
And also some rebates are given under Section 86, 89, 90, 90 A and 91 
Number one, it is an annual tax that is every year it is calculated on annual basis 
all these rebates are deducted, then we get the net tax 
From that amount of tax
as you know, we'll be discussing something about the advanced tax 
Normally the SSE has already paid some amount of self assessment tax 
There will be some amount of tax which might have been
deducted at source or collected at source 
And there are some taxes which are already paid in advance 
Advance payment of taxes also stipulated by the Income Tax Act 
When these three are deducted from
the tax which you have already calculated, we get the net tax liability 
We have already discussed the previous year assessment year 
The net tax liability is to be payable to the government 
If we pay in advance or in excess,
the income tax department will refund it to the assessee 
And if it is being paid less, the excess amount
needs to be paid to the income tax authorities 
Thank you 
, it is an yearly feature  , income tax
Welcome participants, today we will discuss
are subject to pay income tax,
because section two subsection 31 is a broad one
which involves or which takes into its purview, all kinds of entities 
Next important definition, or the term
which I have been using now is Assessee ,
who is an Assessee? Section 2 sub section 7 of
the Income Tax Act defines a person
by whomany tax or any other sum of money is payable under the Act 
We have different kinds of assesse's 
The first category of Assesse's just now, I have told that a person by whom
while discussing various provisions of income tax laws 
any tax or any sum of money is payable under the act 
Second category of Assessee includes any person against whom any proceedings is going on
under the any court of law, that person may not be liable to pay income tax,
but income tax related proceedings
is or are going on in any court of law,
then also that person will be regarded as Assessee 
Third category is known as representative Assessee 
That is, these persons are liable for somebody else income,
like the legal representative of a diseased guardian of a minor 
These are the persons who are liable to pay income tax
Previous year is the year in which
on behalf of some other persons, so they are known as a representative Assessee 
The fourth category is known as Assessee in default 
These are the persons who need not
pay income tax as per their individual capacity is concerned,
but because they are given certain duties
if they failed to comply with the duty or perform the duty, 
if the default is doing the duty, they will become the Assessee
under the Income Tax Act  Suppose, a particular DDO
or finance officer or an accountant is given the duty to deduct tax
from salaries of employees every month 
the assessee earns his or her income 
, if the person who is given that particular esponsibility
is deducting income tax from the salary of his or their employees
regularly as per income tax law and deposits that particular money
into the government treasury, then he or she is performing
his or her duty perfectly  , what happens if
that particular person has not deducted income tax, while he or she paid
the salary to the employees of the organization or having deducted the amount 
They have not deposited the money to the government exchequer 
In that case, they are in default of their respective duties 
The income tax department will not run after
Assessment year is the year in which Income Tax Department
the hundreds of employees who work in that organization 
They will make that particular accountant
or the DDO as a responsible for the income tax 
Then that particular accountant or that particular officer will become assessee
and technically we call them as Assessee in default 
Thus, we get the four categories of assesse's 
the first category is the person by whom
any tax or any other sum of money is payable under the act 
Second category is that against the such kind of persons,
some proceedings are going on in the court of law 
assess or evaluates the tax to be paid by the taxpayer 
Third is that the representative assesses that these persons are liable
to pay tax on behalf of some other person 
And fourthly, assessee in default that these persons are actually not assessee's
but they will become Assessee if they default in performing their respective duties 
Next important definition is income 
Which is a very, very important one as far as the income tax is concerned,
because income tax is charged on the income of a person 
Section two subsection 24 defines the term income
and this definition is inclusive and not exclusive 
Some features of this income are there must be some definite and regular source 
For example, the current year 2018-19 is the previous year
There are different forms of income,
the income tax act recognises the income,
either receipt or accrual receipt whichever is earlier 
There is an interesting concept that legal versus illegal income 
Income Tax Act does not bother
about whether the income is legal or illegal 
An illegal income, illegal income is also subject to income tax 
The regarding the legality or illegality,
other acts are there where that particular persons will be prosecuted,
but income tax is charged on the illegal income also 
that a person earns his or her income during this particular year 
In case of disputed title, again, the income tax is not bothered
that who is the legal owner of that particular title 
Income tax will be charged on the person who is recipient of the income at the moment 
Income Tax set also takes into consideration relief
or reimbursement of expenses that they are not regarded as income 
So the income tax under the definition
or under Section 2 sub section 24 takes into consideration various suspects 
And there are many litigations, court cases
heard these by the honorable courts and accordingly the definition
has become inclusive one  , let us see that
The income tax department will not disturb the person
there are certain heads of income on which income tax is chargeable 
Income Tax Act recognizes five heads of income,
a person may earn his or her income from various sources,
but any income must come under any of the five heads 
These heads, the number one first one includes income from salaries,
the persons who are in employment, get salaries 
, Income tax that makes a separate
provisions for income from salaries 
Second head of income is income from House property, those people who own houses
or house properties and earned their income by way of gains from these properties
during the current year to pay or to charge income tax in this particular year 
it will fall under the second head of income, income from House properties 
Third one is the broad one with income from business or profession 
That is the various sections are there for computation of income for
business or profession  Next trade is capital gains,
that is a person may earn his or an income by selling capital assets
or by selling shares, debentures etc 
, any kind of gains or losses
which occur for such transactions,
they will come under computation of income tax
under the head capital gains  And lastly income from other sources 
But they will evaluate and assess the tax
various definitions as given under the Income Tax Act 1961 
A person can earn income by way of interest on deposits put in different banks
dividend from shares, lotteries, crossword puzzles, etc 
, the last head is a broad one, which talks about
income from other sources , these are the five heads of income
on which income tax is charged 
, number one, it is income from salaries 
Number two, it is income from House property 
Number three, it is business or profession  Number four, it's capital gains
and number five other sources 
, there is a concept called total income 
once this particular year is over  For example, the year
The total income of an Assessee
is the gross total income as reduced by the amount
deductible under sections 80C to 80U 
When we add up all these five heads, that is salaries
house property, business profession, capital gains, other sources,
when we add up with a submission is known as gross total income 
From this gross total income, there are various deductions
as provided under the income tax act
mostly under Section 80C to 80U 
When these deductions are deducted
financial year 2018-19  It starts from first April 2018
from gross total income, we get the total income 
And this is the total income on which income tax is chargeable 
In our next discussion, we'll be discussing
how to calculate tax on various heads of income 
Thank you
and ends on 31st March 2019  A person earns his or her income
during this particular year, we can say this is the previous year 
The next year which starts from first of April 2019
and ends with 31st March 2020  in this year,
the income tax department will evaluate, will calculate
the tax to be paid by the taxpayer
on the income earned by him or her during 2018-19 
We can say that assessment year follows the previous year 
These definitions are very much necessary
To again repeat previous year is the year
in which the person earns his or her income 
And the assessment year is the year in which the income tax department evaluates,
calculates the tax to be paid by the taxpayer on the income
earned during the previous year  Normally, the previous year is
the financial year that the year starts from first of April and ends on 31st March 
But in case of a broken year, like
a business has started on 15th of August  In that case,
the previous year will be 15th of August 2018 and will end on 31st March 2019 
There was a rationalization in income tax laws
to understand the income tax laws
and now the all previous year must end on 31st march of each year 
Suppose a business is started on 31st March itself
then, for that particular year, the previous year will be
only for one day, that is 31st March 2018 to 31st March 2018 
And from the next year it will follow the complete financial year 
This is the assessment year and previous year 
So, normally as I told you, that income tax department does not
disturb the taxpayer during the previous year, they will assess
evaluate the tax only once the previous year end 
, income is earned in year one, assessed to tax only
and when we will proceed in this particular course further 
after completion of year one, that is in the next year, year two,
the year one is known as the previous year, and year two is known as
the assessment year  This is the general rule 
But there are exceptions to this general rule 
I can cite five cases, five examples where
the assessment year is same as the previous year 
That is the income tax department will not wait to
get the year one end and then calculate  They will calculate
and demand the tax from the taxpayer in the very year in which the income is earned 
Case number one, we refer to Section 172
, make yourself clear about the concepts, which we will be
shipping business income of non residents ship owners
who do not have any representive in India 
In that case, the income tax will be charged
in the very year in which the income tax is earned 
If the income tax department has the knowledge
that some persons are leaving India for good
with no intention to come back to India,
in that case, the previous year and assessment year will be the same 
Assessment of association of persons
body of individual or any artificial juridical person
discussing now  To begin with, let me start with the concept called
which is formed or established only for a limited period
then also the previous year and assessment year will be the same one 
In case of persons who are likely to transfer their asset to avoid tax 
They are also liable to pay income tax on the very year of income 
And lastly, in case of discontinued business
the previous year and assessment year will be the same 
Except is these five situations  The normally the income earned by
the Assessee in year one is assessed to tax or subject to tax in year two 
This is the definition of assessment year and previous year 
, in my discussion, just now, I was using the word called persons 
assessment year and previous year 
, Income Tax Act has defined the word persons in detail 
The Income Tax Act says that income tax is payable by a person 
And the question is who is a person?
Section two subsection 31 of the Income Tax Act defines a person 
It includes an individual which normally we are here 
A Hindu undivided family HUF, HUF is a special entity created by Hindu law
where the head of the family is known as karta
and the other members are copper sinners 
, Hindu undivided family is an entity
of under the Income Tax Act  So income tax file can be maintained
, What is the difference between these two terms?
in the name of Hindu undivided family 
Thirdly a company, a company is registered under the Companies Act 2013 
A firm that is a partnership firm whether it is a partnership firm
or a Limited Liability Partnership 
Next, an association of persons or body of individual 
Then a local authority like municipality, board or corporation 
And lastly,every artificial juridical person not falling
in any of the groups which I have just now mentioned 
This is so broad that the deity also falls
under this particular definition , you can say that all kinds of entity
These terms we'll be using colloquially and very frequently
For future to take corrective actions 
Fourthly, tax planning helps in minimizing tax liability
in short term as well as in the long term 
Tax management helps in avoiding
payment of interest, penalties, prosecution etc 
We can say that tax planning is optional 
Tax management is essential for every tax paying entity 
In this week, we summarize that we have learned
the various nitty gritties of income tax as well as
the ways for minimizing the tax liability legally 
to various tax laws and procedures 
To summarize, we can say that the ways of tax evasion
should not be adopted  Tax avoidance, although not illegal 
She's also not desirable, while
a person should go for the techniques and tools for tax planning,
as well as any taxpayer or any good citizen should go for tax management 
Thank you very much 
We'll meet you in the next week with a new chapter 
Sri Arun Jaitley the union finance minister,
while presenting the union budget 2018-19
lamented that India is a tax non compliant society
that majority of the Indians who can afford to pay tax,
but they do not pay income tax  A statistics was published in 2015-16 figures
that only 3 7 crore individuals filed income tax 
Out of these only 76 lakhs showed income above five lakhs 
And out of this 76 lakhs the irony is that
56 lakhs are salaried class  That means,
Welcome to the course direct tax laws and practice 
people who can afford to pay income taxgiven a chance
they are willing to remain outside the tax net 
, there is a normal tendency to reduce the payment of tax liabilities 
The tax liabilities can be reduced by various ways 
I can discuss four ways in details  Number one is the tax evasion 
Number two is the tax avoidance  Number three is tax planning 
And fourthly, I will highlight various ways for tax management 
Regarding the tax evasion  Tax evasion is the way to reduce tax liability 
But one should remember this is illegal
and whenever the person is caught, he will be punished under civil
Thank you for enrolling into the program 
and criminal procedures  So this tax evasion is not
at all desirable, and no one should adopt this particular means 
Secondly is the tax avoidance  Tax avoidance is per se, not
illegal, but not desirable  also  There are various ways
where a person can legally avoid the payment of tax 
But it doesn't help the country in their growth or in their development 
as far as possible, the tax avoidance routes
should not also be adopted by taxpayers 
Third one, which is the tax planning, which is legal, and which is desirable
also  It's a win win situation  The Income Tax Act
We will discuss various nitty gritties of
make ample provisions for the taxpayer to reduce their tax liabilities 
One of the common example is that 80 section 80C 
Whereby a taxpayer can save money into particular desired avenues 
And if the money is saved in those avenues,
then the taxpayer can save a substantial amount of income tax 
, the money where it is being saved 
This money is also used by the government
for various development purposes and capital formation purposes 
, tax planning is a win win situation 
Whereby the taxpayer saves a substantial amount of tax 
direct tax laws and practice in this particular course 
As well as he contributes for the development and growth of the country 
In the entire course, we'll be discussing various ways
for tax planning, and we will give tips whereby
a taxpayer can save their income tax by resorting to various avenues as
specified in tax planning  Fourth one is Tax Management 
Tax Management is actually compliance to tax laws 
It relates to maintenance of accounts, audit
that is the timely audit of accounts, the payment of tax, filing of returns, etc 
In this particular course, will also highlight
various aspects of tax management 
The basic objective as has been told
Whereby a good citizen knows that how to comply with the tax laws and procedures
and goes for the better tax management 
Thus, we have learned the difference between tax evasion,
tax avoidance and tax planning  ,
that while tax evasion is undesirable
and not at all expected from a good citizen 
Tax evasion can be resorted to by overstating the expenditure
understating the income, not disclosing the income earned by the assessee 
, these are all risky ventures 
A good citizen should not adopt these practices,
is that to familiarize these participants with the various tax laws 
because it will amount to excessive amount of penalties
and the chance of prosecution 
Second one is tax avoidance  Just to summarize,
that it is the way by taking various loopholes in the act or various
avenues in the act whereby a person avoids the payment of tax 
Which is not illegal, whereas I repeat,
this is not so much desirable also  The most desirable is the tax planning,
like selecting an appropriate business plan,
investing in desired projects, etc  Whereby the taxpayer
helps the country to grow at the same time reduces his or her own tax liabilities 
And our main purpose is to make the
And there are various consultants who will give
advice on the tax avoidance rules or tax planning rules 
Tax planning and tax management is what all wants now a days,
like at the one hand, no one wants to pay more tax 
At the same time none wants to evade tax also,
as the implications are very strict 
That's why people should adopt for tax planning and tax management,
as both are the best options to lower the tax burden
without affecting the spirit of law  There is difference between
tax planning and tax management while the objective of the tax planning
students understand the nitty gritties of tax laws
is to minimize the tax liability 
The objective of tax management
is to comply with the provisions of
income tax lawand its rules  Tax planning includes tax management,
while tax management deals with filing of return on time,
getting the accounts audited, deducting the tax at source,
paying the tax on time, etc  Tax planning relates to future
but tax management relates to past, present as well as future 
Past, it includes assessment, proceedings, appeals, revisions, etc 
While present it includes filing of return, payment of advance tax etc 
as well as to make them compliant
Direct_Tax_439
This week we'll be learning income from other sources 
This head is a broad one and encompasses
any income which cannot be taken
in any of the previous sets of income
that is, it is neither income from salary;
it is neither income from house property
neither capital gains or profits
and gains of business or profession  Section 56 of the Income Tax Act
deals with the basis of charge and it includes quite a large number of income 
It includes dividend that is dividend earned by the assessee 
But remember, dividend from Indian companies are not chargeable to tax
under section 10 because the company itself pays the dividend 
The basis of charge also says that
at the income from other sources include winning from lotteries,
employees contribution towards staff welfare scheme,
interest on securities, rental income of machinery,
plant or furniture, rental income of letting out of plant,
machinery or furniture Some received under keyman insurance policy
and also gift if it exceeds rupees 50,000 in the previous year 
, all these are added under the head income from other sources 
Welcome learners  In this week
There are certain deductions which are available under section 57 
And these deductions include commissions or remuneration payable
for realizing the dividend or interest,
deduction in respect of employees contribution towards
staff welfare scheme, repairs, depreciation
in case of letting out of plant machinery etc 
And also in case of family pension
a standard deduction is given that is 33 3% of the pension
or rupees 15,000, whichever is less 
, besides this section 57 also allows any other expenses,
we'll be learning the last head of income,
if these are incurred for earning that particular income,
but as it it cannot give a blanket exemption like this 
, there are four conditions which need to be satisfied 
Number one, such expenses must be spened exclusively
for the purpose of earning that particular income 
It must not be in the nature of capital expenditure 
It must not be in the nature of personal expenses of the assessee
and it must be paid in the relevant previous year
not prior or nor subsequent 
, remember section 58 also says that there are certain amounts
that is income from other sources  If you remember,
which are not deductible under this section,
like any expenses which are of personal nature,
these are not allowed to be exempted 
, this is a summary of our discussion of
income from other sources 
there are five heads of income 
We have seen income from salaries 
We have seen income from house property,
profits and gains of business and profession
and also last week about the capital gains 
Welcome participants  Today we will discuss about the background
by Sir James Wilson in order to meet the losses sustained by
the British government on account of Sepoy Mutiny, and from since then,
it has become a common feature in India 
We get the act in 1860, which includes the income tax as a formal system 
And the most comprehensive income tax law was the Income Tax Act 1922 
Income tax became a primary source of revenue
for the central government since 1922 
Then, India got independence in 1947  Professor Nicholas Kaldor,
an economist was invited to India to study
the taxation system of the country 
of income tax in India and the history of<>lp income tax 
Based on the recommendations of Professor Kaldor
the wealth tax act 1957, the expenditure Tax Act 1957
and the gift tax act 1958 were introduced 
Actually Professor kaldor advocated for expenditure tax rather than income tax 
But income tax 1961 came into existence with effect from
first of April 1962  Based on the recommendations
of the law commission, and the inquiry committee 
The Income Tax Act has become a very interesting feature
in the country's economy  Presently,
the majority we try to get majority Indians under the tax net 
Income tax in India we can trace back to the ages of ancient literature 
There is a permanent account number given to most of the citizens of the country 
Which is a 10 digit alphanumerical number,
which was launched in 1994  It acts as a unique identifier
and enables the income tax department to link all transactions
like tax payment, TDS that is tax deducted at source, TCS,
tax collected at source, income tax return, high value transaction etc 
to individual taxpayers  And we can see the day
when pan will be closely interlinked with Aadhar
so that all transactions can be linked to income tax 
The income tax department in India
The Manusmrti presents itself as a discourse given by Manu 
is governed by the central government 
The administration of income tax in India
is controlled by the Apex body Central Board of direct tax 
Under it, we have a director general of income tax or chief commissioners of income tax 
Then we have commissioners of income tax 
Then commissioners of income tax appeals,
additional director of income tax, aditional commissioner of Taxes 
We have joint director and that is the joint commissioner of taxes 
We have deputy director or Deputy Commissioner of taxes, Assistant Director,
income tax officers, and ultimately we have got inspector of income tax 
And we can get a reference of income tax in Manusmriti 
The Income Tax Act 1961 makes ample provision
for the aggrieved citizens that is a aggrieved taxpayer for making
different kinds of appeals  That is, if a taxpayer
is not satisfied with the activities or the decision of any income tax authority,
there is a system for appeal 
First, authority of appeal is the Commissioner of income tax appeals 
If he is not, or she is not satisfied with that decision,
she or he can go to income tax appellate tribunal 
Then ultimately we have got High Court and the honourable Supreme Court is there 
, there are different layers of making the appeal 
Kautilya's Arthashastra is an ancient Indian treatise
Indian income tax follows a very equitable rule 
There are different kinds of taxes and system all over the world 
This tax can be either proportional that the income tax amount
will depend directly proportional to the income of an assessee or a person 
On the other hand, it can be regressive,
that is, as you earn more, you have to pay less or third one is progressing
that as one earns more, they are to pay more amount of income tax 
Indian Income Tax Act 1961 follows the progressive rate of taxation 
That is, a person with lesser income has to pay less tax 
While a person with higher income has to pay more amount of income tax 
on statecraft, economic policy and military strategy 
Currently we have got an exemption limit
of rupees 250,000 that is up to rupees 250,000
a person need not pay any amount of income tax 
The budget of 2019-20 has made a tax rebate,
full tax rebate to the people who are earning up to rupees five lakhs 
But otherwise, the normal rates are gradually increases to
5% that is 10%, 20% and 30%  That means,
as the person earns more income, the tax rate also increases 
Income Tax Act 1961 makes ample provision for tax incentives
and tax penalties  We can say that Income Tax Act 1961
Kautilya in his book, Arthashastra, has referred
as a balanced one, the tax incentives are ample 
A taxpayer if he or she follows the rules given in the Income Tax Act
the provisions in the Income Tax Act, the sections which are there,
whichencourages a taxpayer to invest in particular avenues
to make certain expenditures, which helps in national building 
Then various kinds of tax incentives are there 
At the same time for those tax evaders
who evade payment of tax or who are non compliant to the tax laws
it makes immense provisions for tax penalty 
Thus, the income tax is a comprehensive tax law in India 
the text to be collected by the king from the subjects 
It is a challenging feature, that majority of the Indians
have not come into the tax net till now, but gradually with the
inception of various digital policies, as taken by the Government of India 
More and more people are coming into the tax net 
In our next discussions, we'll be learning
other basic concepts of Income Tax Act 
Thank you 
In modern India, the income tax was first introduced in 1860
As I told you about the aggregation of agriculture income
then it will attract the aggregation clause of agricultural income 
After agricultural income, let's see that what are the other incomes
which are exempted from income tax 
Number two is the amount received by a member
from the income of an HUF,
Because HUF itself is a person and the tax paying entity 
, when the HUF pays the tax,
that portion of income which a member receives from HUF,
he or she did not pay income tax on that income 
Same as the way of a partnership firm 
with non agricultural income, the rule says that
As the partnership firm itself pays the tax 
,the share of the profit when it goes to a particular partner,
he or she did not pay income tax on that share of profit 
Interest on notified securities and bonds issued to non residents 
Interest on savings certificates to non residents 
Remuneration received by individuals, who are not citizens of India 
These are all exempted incomes  The list of exempted incomes is long enough 
As I've told and it includes awards for literary,
scientific and artistic works and other awards
by the government, pension received by recipient of gallantry awards,
there are two conditions which need to be satisfied for this partial integration 
income of a member of a scheduled tribe
who are in specified areas 
Most of the northeastern states come under this
section 10 (26) and our people staying in
scheduled tribe people staying in Arunachal, Meghallaya, Nagaland etc 
need not pay any amount of income tax
if the income is generated in that specified area 
Specified income of a Sikkimese individual 
tea boards subsidy, other subsidies like rubber, coffee,
cardamon, etc  Income from units of from the administrator
Number one, the net agriculture income should exceed Rs 5000 per annum 
of specific undertaking, specified company, mutual fund
under section 10, sub section 35 
Income of educational institutions, income of hospitals
till assessment year 1999-2000there was blanket
exemptions in these two institutions 
But as the government found that many of such institutions are established
for profit motive, and then since the assessment year 1999-2000
this blanket exemption is withdrawn 
Section 10 sub section 23C has been imposed
and there are certain conditions are there 
Secondly, the non agriculture income should exceed
If the institution satisfies those conditions,
then only exemptions will be provided from Income Tax Act 
There are tax holidays for newly established units
in special economic zones  Special economic zones are
created by the government to boost entrepreneurship,
to boost industrialization in a particular region 
Suppose a unit has begun or begins to manufacture
or produce articles or things or provide any service in any SEZ
during the previous year, relevant to the assessment year 2006-07
or subsequent assessment year, but not later than
the maximum amount not chargeable to tax 
assessment year 2020-21  , such
established units will enjoy tax holiday
under section 10A of the Income Tax Act,
section 13 A of the Income Tax Act gives exemption
from income earned by a political party from House property, capital gains
or other sources  They will also earn income
by way of voluntary contribution  But because of Section 13A,
this political parties are exempted from payment of income tax 
Same way, section 13B has been inserted to give exemption
to electoral trust  These are some of the main features of
At this moment, it is five lakhs for resident
the exempted income as provided by the Income Tax Act 1961 
Thank you
that is very senior citizen, three lakh for residents senior citizen
and 250,000 for all other individuals and HUFs 
, if these two conditions are satisfied,
standard deduction, deduction for entertainment allowance
and deduction for professional taxes paid 
So in the three items under Section 16 are deducted from gross salary,
we get the income from salary 
The salary is taxable,
and there are different terms by which a salary may beknown 
And income tax act tried to encompass all this kind of terms 
It includes the basic salary,
there may be besides salary there will be
some payment in the form of dearness allowance, dearness pay
income from other sources 
a person may receive advance salary,
a person may receive arrear salary 
He may have leave encashment while in service,
leave incashmenttat the time of retirementor leaving the job,
salary in lieu of notice,
fees and commission,bonus, gratuity 
He might be receiving or he she or she might be receiving
pension, pension may be monthly pension,
commuted pension,pension may be under
the new pension scheme 
Today,we'll be discussingin details
He or she may be received
annuity from employer there may be some
contribution from employers side in excess of a specified percentage 
There will be retrenchment compensation  The list is long enough
and the gross while calculating the gross salary,
all such incomesare calculated
to find outthe amount oftaxable income 
how income is calculated under the headsalaries 
There are three sections in the Income Tax Act
for computation of income under the head salaries,
section 15 talks about the chargeability
of income under the head income from salary 
Whereas section 16 talks about the deductions
from salary income and section 17
discusses various meanings of salary perquisite,
Welcome friends,to the discussion of the first head of income
profits in lieu of salary etc  
, these are the three sections section 15, section 16,
section 17,which are devoted to the computation of income
under the head salaries 
Before we discuss the methodology for computation of
income under the head salaries,
let us clear certain important concepts which are related to salaries 
Number oneto come under the head salaries,
the income must have a relationship between employer and employee
that means the person who gives the income should be employer
under the Income Tax Act 
and the person who receives the income should be employee 
, if there is no employer employee relationship
between the giver and taker, the income cannot come
under the head salaries even though the income is known assalary 
For example, salary to a partner,
a partner in a partnership firm is a not an employee of the firm,
rather,he or she is one of the owners of the firm 
So that's whythe salary of a partner received from the firm
cannot be treated as salary incomeas
the condition of employer employee relationship is missing 
Just to recapitulate as we already discussed,
So that salary to a partner will come underprofits and gains
of business and professionof that particularpartner 
Secondly, Salaries and Wages 
There is no difference between the term salaries and wages,
though they are may be some
meaning difference in meaning in Oxford dictionary 
But as far as the Income Tax Act is concerned,
salaries and wages are treated at part 
It may happen that salary may be received from
more than one sources During a previous year
there are five heads of income
an employee may receive salary from more than one sources,
income tax will be charged on the total salary received by a person
during the previous year 
That personmay be in full time
or part time employment,but income tax is not concerned with this 
Foregoing of salary that if an individual
forgoes his or her salary for a particular period,
in that case salary is calculated on due basis,
and as such income tax is chargeable
on the salary forgone by him or her 
under whichthe income tax is calculated Number one,
But in case of surrender of salary,
then if the salary is surrendered
for a specific cause or for a cause, which is raised by the government,
in that case, income tax is not chargeable
on the surrendered salary  In case salary payee's paid tax free,
the employee or the assessee has to take back is to add back
the income tax partand then income tax will be computed on the total
income of the person 
The place of accrual of salaries also important
which determines
income from salaries 
the income of salary of a particular person 
Section 15 of the Income Tax Act deals with the basis of charge for salary 
It says that salary is chargeable to tax
on due basisor receipt basis, whichever is earlier 
That means,if the salary is received in advance,
income tax will be payable  In case of arrear salary,
as the salary was not due at that point of time,
which received afterwards,the salary,
the income tax will be paid
on the year of on the time of receiptof the arrear salary 
Number two, income from House property 
Section 17 of the Income Tax Act
has categorizedsalary into three part  It defines salary
under Section 17(1), it defines perquisites
under Section 17(2),
and profits in lieu of salaryunder Section 17(3) 
,we'll be discussing one by one in detail
about the meaning of these terms 
Section 17(1) define the term salaryand it includes
it is an inclusive definition
and includes monetary as well as non monetary items 
Number three,profits and gains of business and profession 
For computation of salary,
we have to first find out the basic salary of the person
with itthe allowances are added
with it,the value of perquisite are added
with it, we add profits in lieu of salary and ultimately we get
the gross salary, which is aggregation of basic salary
allowances, perquisites and profits in lieu of salary 
From gross salary, the deduction is provided
under Section 16 of the Income Tax Act 
Andsection 16 at this moment gives three kinds of deduction,
Number four,capital gains and number five
Section 17 (3)discusses the profits in lieu of salary 
Rs 36,000  Secondly,
excess of rent paid over 10% salary,
rent paidis 31,500, 10% of salary is 22,850
and that's why the amount stands as Rs 8650 
And third condition is as it is in Kanpur,
so 40% of salary which comes at Rs 91,400 
, out of these three amount Rs 36,000,
Rs 8650and Rs 91400 the least is Rs 8650
and as such8650 is exempted under Section 10 (13A)
of the Act and the balance amount of Rs 27,350
GPF,PPF insurance policy etc 
is chargeable as house rent allowance 
are not includedin the definition of profits in lieu of salary
and any amount received prior to employment
or after cessation of employment also are not included
in the definition of profits in lieu of salary 
Let's see the meaning of allowances 
Besides basic salary,an employer may give benefits
to the employeein two ways, either in cash or in kind 
If it is given in cash, this is known asallowances,
if it is given in kind, these are known as perquisites 
Profits in lieu of salary includescompensation due
, let's see the different allowances and
the taxability of the allowances 
There are three categories of allowances,
one is fully taxable allowance, that is, these allowances are fully taxable 
There are fully exempted allowances,
that is these allowances are not chargeable to tax 
And thirdly,partially exempted allowances,
that is part of this allowances is taxable and part is exempted 
Direct_Tax_821
Allowances which are fully taxable
or received from employer on termination,
includescity compensatory allowance,
entertainment allowance in most of the cases it is taxable
for government employees up to Rs 5000 it is deductible 
There are other allowances which will be known as tiffin allowance,
fixed medical allowance, service allowance 
, in this way there may be different kinds of allowances
which arefully taxable under the Income Tax Act 
Allowances which are partly taxable
number one happens to bethe house rent allowance 
It is very interesting that if an employee
compensation due or receive from employer
is in receipt of house rent allowance
and resides in a rented house,
in that case,he or she may be allowed exemption under Section 10 (13A) 
, there are three conditions being provided 
Number one,actual HRA received,
number two,excess of rent paid over 10% of salary
and number three, 40 percent of salary,
but if the house is situated in any of the fourmetros,
now we can say the presidential citieslikeKolkata,
Mumbai,Chennai and Delhi
on modification of terms of employment,
in that case it is 50% of the salary 
Again I am repeating number one, the actual HRA received;
number two, excess of rent paid over 10% of salary
and number three, 40 percent of salary or
50% of salary as the case may be 
Among these three, the list
will be exempted under Section 10 (13A) 
Herethe meaning of salary
for these HRA purposes when I was talking about 40% of salary
50% of salary or 10% of salary,
any payment dueor receivedfrom employer
what does the salary mean?
Interestingly the meaning of salary is different for different different purposes 
For this HRA purpose,
it includesbasic salary
plus dearness pay or dearness allowance,
if the terms of employment so provides
and thirdly commission,if commission is paid
as a fixed percentage of turnover 
In that case salary eansthe aggregate ofthese three 
Let us discuss a problem
or former employerexcept exempted part of gratuity,
on house rent allowance 
Mr A,a resident of Kanpur
receives Rs 2,02,000 per annum
as basic salary during the previous year 2017-18 
In addition,he gets Rs 20,200 per annum as dearness allowance,
forming part of basic salary
for computation of all retirement benefits,
7% Commissionon sales made by him
andRs 36,000 per annum as house rent allowance
are also given to Mr  A 
HRA, commuted pension,
Sales made by Mr  A during the relevant previous year
is Rs 90,000  He pays Rs 31,500 per annum as house rent 
We have to determine the quantum of house rent allowance
which is exempt from tax 
Let's see the solution 
First we have to calculate the salary
for the purpose of computing house rent allowance,
which is exempt from tax
and it works out to be Rs 2,28,500
that is, we calculate the basic salary
retrenchment compensation,RPF that is recognized provident fund etc 
Rs 2,02,000 plus dearness allowance
Rs 20,200, dearness allowance will be included because it is a part of salary
and commission at the rate of 7% on Rs 90,000
which comes out at Rs 6300  Commission is taken into
calculation of salary because commission is given
as a fixed percentage on turnover 
,out of the house rent allowance received by Mr A
Rs 36,000 the three conditions
are given and the least of these threewill be exempted from tax 
Number one,the actual house rent allowance received
Payment from approved superannuation fund
The important points in HR exemption calculation is number one,
So uncommuted pension
are like salary which are paid monthly,
commuted pension is given in one lump sum
at the time ofretirement  A person is free
toget a part of the pension as uncommuted,
a part of the pension as commuted 
Section 10(10A) provides exemption
in respect of commuted pension 
As per section 10(10A)
the payment in respect of commuted pension is exempt,
but if it is provided for the part of the year,
specified there in 
Its treatment is discussed like
number a,employees of the central government,
local authorities,statutory corporation,
members of defence services
any commuted pension received
is fullyexempt from tax 
In case of non government employees,
any commuted pension received is exempt from tax
in two circumstances, first one,if the employee
in that case, we can calculate on monthly basis 
is in receipt of gratuity,
then one thirdof the total commuted pensionis exempted 
But if the employee does not receive any gratuity,
then one half of the total
commuted value of pension isexempted 
Besides HRA,there are other special allowances
to meet the expenses relating to dutiesor personal expenses 
Section 10 (14) provides exemptions
either fullyor partially
to these special allowances 
These special allowances or benefits,
are not being nature of a perquisite specially granted to meet expense
incurred wholly, unnecessarily and exclusively
we have to know the salary  We have to know
in the performance of duties of an office or employment 
But for theallowances under this category,there is no limit
on the amount which the employee can receive
from the employer, but whatever amount is received,
should be fully utilizedfor the purpose
for which it was given to him to avail the exemption,
otherwise, the unspent amountistaxable 
The special allowances
may includetravelling allowance,convenience allowance,
helper allowance, uniform allowance,
the HRA, which is received by the employee 
daily allowance, research allowance etc 
, the amount which is utilized
for this purposeis fullyexempted,
otherwise the unutilized amount will be taxable 
There are some allowances, which are prescribed
for the purpose of Section 10 sub section 14(ii)
and the Income Tax Act has given a list of such allowances
and also the amount which can be claimed
as exemption from such allowances 
Specialallowances like special compensatory
Number three we have to know
hilly allowance,the exemption limits differs,
it may befrom Rs 300
as high as Rs 2200 or anything like
border area allowance,special contingency allowance
because of on the basis of the toughness of the location,
the allowanceslimits are also enhanced 
Children and education allowance is the common allowance which is being given
by the employer to the employee,
the exemption limit is Rs 100 per month
per childto a maximum of two children,
the amount of rent paid by the employee 
but if such children residein hostels,
in that case, the exemption limit will be
Rs 300 per month per child for a maximum oftwo children 
, in this way there are
compensatory field area allowances of
2600 per month in specified areas is exempted,
compensatory modified
field area allowances Rs 1000 per month
is exempted and the list is long
and enough There is an insurgency allowance
And number four,the place where the house is takenon rent 
and the exemption limit is Rs 3900 per month 
Whereas, in case of transport allowance,
it is Rs 1600 per month 
There is also underground allowance 
For thisan amount of Rs 800 per month is exempted 
Direct_Tax_987
Regarding transport allowance
till assessment year 2018-19
Rs 1600 per monthwas exempted for all employees
other than specially abled because they had a higher amount of exemption 
,if we know these four figures,
Butto the normal people,
this 1600 per monthexemption under transport allowance is not available
from the assessment year 2019-20 
, allowances which are fully exempt 
Allowances to High Court judges,
allowances receivedfrom United Nations organization,
compensatory allowance under Section 222(2) of the Constitution,
sumptuary allowance, allowances payable to outside India 
These are some of the allowances
which are totally or fully exempt from income tax 
in that case, we can calculate
Let's discuss the term Pension 
Concise Oxford Dictionary defines pension as a periodic payment
made speciallyby governmentor a company
or other employers to the employee
in consideration of past service
payable after his retirement  The pension is of two types,
commuted pension and uncommuted pension 
Commuted pension is a lump sum,
which is givento the employee
at the time of his or herretirement 
the exemption as provided under Section 10 (13A) of the Income Tax Act 
Uncommuted pension are paid monthly 
Uncommuted pension refersto pension received
periodically normally monthly  It is fully taxable
in the hands ofboth government and non government employees 
In case of commuted pension,
commutation means interchange,
that is commuted pension means lump sum amount
taken by commuting the whole or part of the pension 
Many persons converttheir future right
to receive pensionin a lump sum amount receivable immediately 
If it is providedon annual normally does calculate on an annual basis,
It will be interesting to do aproblem
, let's see case 4  whileMr  C
receives gratuity In that case, maximum amount exempt from tax
will be one third of Rs four lakhthat is Rs 133,333 
As the amount received in commutation of pension
is less than the maximum amount exempt from tax
nothing is chargeable to tax 
one third of his pension commuted for Rs 90,000 
, let's see what would happen
for calculation of taxable pension 
While uncommuted pension is chargeable to tax,
commuted pension is exempted from tax
in the case of government employee 
Therefore, whatever the amount of commuted pension,
that is the commuted pension of Rs 92,000 is exempt from tax 
The amount of uncommuted pension
is calculated as under
on taxable amount of pension 
uncommuted pension up to February 2019
that is Rs 900 into 8 Rs 7200 
An uncommuted pension for the month of March 2019
total pension was uncommuted pension was 900 ,
one third is commuted so he will get two thirds of these 
So two third into Rs  900 into one month,
it comes to Rs 600  , the total is 7800 
on this amount income tax is chargeable 
Now see case 2  Mr  B
retires from a private firm B limited on August 31, 2018 
Let's see an example 
He gets pension of Rs 1000 per month
up to January 31, 2019 
With effect from February one 2019he gets
60% of pension commutedfor Rs 1,70,000 
The question is, does it make any difference
if he also receives gratuity
of Rs 4000 at the time of retirement?
Let's see the solution 
In this case Mr  B is a non government employee 
So while uncommuted pension is fully chargeable to tax,
Determine the taxable amount of pension
like salary, commuted pension is partly chargeable
to and partly exempt from tax The amount of pension
will be taxable as under
regarding the uncommuted pension
that is from August 31, 2018 to January 31, 2019,
1000 per month into five Rs 5000 
An uncommuted pension from February 1 to march 31 for two months,it is Rs 800 
, total uncommuted pension chargeable to tax
is Rs 5800 Regarding the commuted value that is 60% is commuted
is Rs 1,70,000  , we can calculate the
for the assessment year 2019-20 in the following cases:
commuted value of full pension
that is 1,70,000 into 100 by 60 
, we get the value of full pensionis 283,333 
, suppose Mr B does not receive gratuity 
In that case the amount exempt will be
one halfof the total commuted value of pension
that is half into 2,83,333
that is Rs 1,41,667 will be exempted 
, the chargeable amount of commuted pension will be
1,70,000 minus 1,41,667 that is Rs
case oneMr  A retires from the central government services
28,333 is chargeable to tax 
Suppose Mr  B receives gratuity,
the amount exempt will be one third of the commuted value of pension
that is 1/3 of 2,83,333
which is 94,444  , the commuted value of pension
which is chargeable to tax a salary
is Rs 1,70,000minus 94,444 that is 75,556 
, let's seecase three 
Mr  C retires from C Ltd on March 31, 2018 
C Ltd paysRs 2600 per month
on June 30, 2018  He gets pension
as pensionbut does not pay any gratuityon the request of Mr 
C limited pays Rs one lakhin lieu of commutation of
25% of pension on February 28, 2019 
In such case, what would be the taxable amount?
Let's seethat the amount of pension taxable as
salary will be computed as uncommuted pension
from April 1, 2018to February 28, 2019
that is Rs 2600 into 11 is Rs 28,600 
Uncommuted pension from March 1, 2019
to march 31, 2019 that is Rs 2,600,
of Rs  900 per month, up to February, 2019
75% of it for one month, it is 1950 
, total uncommuted pension chargeable to tax
will be 30,550 Regarding commuted pension,
commuted value of 25% of the usual pension is Rs one lakh 
,the commuted value of full pension will be
one lakh into hundred divided by 25
that is Rs four lakhs  , maximum amount exempt from tax
ishalf of Rs four lakh
as Mr  C does not receive gratuity,
, half of Rs four lakh is Rs two lakh 
that is Rs  900 into 8 
But as the amount received in commutation of
pensionis less than the maximum amount exempt from tax
nothing is chargeable to tax 
, maximum amount exempt from tax
in caseMr  C receives gratuity
will be one third of total commuted value of pension 
, one third into Rs four lakh is equal to Rs 1,33,333 
But as the amount received in commutation of pension
is less than the maximum amount exempt from tax,
nothing is chargeable to tax 
With effect fromMarch 1, 2019,he gets,
Now let's discuss about section 10(10),
which is recognized by the Commissioner of income tax 
One is unrecognized provident fund 
Which is not recognized by the Commissioner of income tax 
There is statutory provident fund or general provident fund 
We call it SPFor GPF
which is normally applicable to the government employees
and there is open to all which is known as public provident fund 
There are different types of tax treatments
for these four types of provident fund
likeemployer's contribution
The rule is thatany death-cum gratuity
it is a benefit which is received byan employee 
In that case,it attracts the income taximposition,
but in case of recognized provident fund
any amount up to 12% of salary is not taxable 
That means any amount in excess of 12%is taxable
in case of unrecognized provident fund,
employers contribution whatever amount
the employer contributes, it is not taxable 
In case of recognized provident fund, it isfully exempted 
But in case of public provident fund,
is exempt from tax to the extent of least of the following 
normally the employer does not provide
contribution on public provident fund,
public provident fund is created by the employeeon their own 
Regarding employees contribution,
employees contributing, spending some amount for good reasons 
So, that's why he or she should be eligible
for deduction under Section 80C 
Let's see whether he or she is eligible or not 
In case of recognized provident fund,
the entire moneywhich he or she contributes to recognize
Number one,Rs, 10 lakhs it is enhanced to Rs, 20 lakhs
provident fund is eligible for deduction 
In case of unrecognized provident fund, it is not eligible 
In case of statutory provident fund
and public provident fund in both these cases
whatever amount the employee contributes,
the amountis eligible for deduction under Section 80C 
Regarding the interest credited,
in case of recognized Provident Fund,
the amount in excess of 9 5% per annum is taxable 
In case of statutory provident fund and public provident fund,
fromMarch 29, 2018  Number 2,actual gratuity received,
it is fully exempted And in case of undrecognized provident fund,
it is not taxable at the moment 
At the time of retirement,
when a person's received lump sum amount,
in case of recognized provident fund,
it is exempted in almost all cases
except a very few cases if the employee
has not completed five years of service
in those cases it may be taxable,
otherwise in majority of cases, it is nottaxable 
number 3, 15 days salary
In case of public provident fund also it is exempted 
In case of GPF or SPF,
it is exempted,but in case of unrecognized Provident Fund,
the employers contribution
and interest their own is fully taxable
in the year in which the amount is received by
the employee from unrecognized provident fund 
based onthe last 10 months average salary drawn
for each completed year of service
or part thereofin excess ofsix months 
Salary for this purpose means basic salaryand dearness allowance
and number of days in a month
which talks on exemption from gratuity 
for this calculation is taken as26 
For the non government employees
who are not covered under the payment of gratuity act,
there are also three conditions provided
number 1,Rs 10 lakhs 
Number 2 gratuity actually received 
Number 3 half month salary
that is based on last 10 months average salary
for each completed year of service 
Here,we ignore the fraction
Retirement gratuity received
and salary for the purpose means basic salary
and dearness allowance,if provided in the terms of employment
for the retirement benefitsforming part of the salary
and also commissionif it is given as a fixed percentage on
turnover Salary includes fees, commission,
perquisites, or profits in lieu of salary 
And also it includes advanced salary,
leave salary, leave encashment etc 
, let's discuss the amount
which is received by a person
under the pension code regulations applicable to members of
as encashment ofunutilized earned leave
at the time of retirement 
Just to note thatif this amount is received
during service, it is fully taxable,
but if it is received at the time of retirement,
then exemption is available under Section 10 sub section (10AA) 
For government employees,
the leave salary received at the time of retirement
is fully exempt from tax 
For non government employees there are four conditions 
defence serviceis fully exempt from tax 
Number one,the leave salary actually received 
Number 2 10 months salary
on the basis of average of last 10 months,
cash equivalent of leave notavailed 
An earned leave entitlement can not exceed 30 days
for every year of actual service 
And number 4, there is a limitof Rsthree lakhs 
Out of this four the least is exempted
under Section 10(10A A)from the amount received as leave encashment 
Section 10(10B) provides exemption from the amount
Central State Government employees, any death cum
received as retrenchment compensation 
The retrenchment compensation will be exemptunder Section 10(10B) 
There are two conditions 
Number one,the amount which is calculated
in accordance with the industrial disputes act 1947
orthe amount not less than Rs  five lakhs
as may be notified by the central government,
whichever is lower  So that amount is exempted
under Section 10(10B)  Voluntary retirement receipts,
lump sum payment or otherwise received by an employee
retirement gratuity is fully exempt from tax 
at the time of voluntary retirement would be taxable
as profits in lieu of salary 
However,it will be exempt under Section 10(10C),
subject to certain conditions 
The eligible undertakings are public sector company,
any other companyand authority established by a central or state government,
a local authority, a cooperative society
and university established or incorporated under a stateor central
or provincial actan Institute of Technology,
an institute of management of central government,
For non government employees there are two categories
any state government, central government
or any Institute of special importance,
all these are eligible undertakings under this section 
Direct_Tax_1270
The limit, the maximum limit of exemption
should not exceed rupees five lakhs 
Before we discuss about perquisites and his valuation,
let's clear the concept of provident fund 
Provident fund is created
forthe future security of an employee
one, is non government employees covered
andthe credit balance in a provident fundconsists of
employees contribution, Interest on employees contribution,
employer's contribution, interest onemployers contribution 
So with all these four
the provident fund is created
and which helps the employee
at the time of his or her retirement
as he or she getsa lump sum amount
from this particular fund  There are different types of provident fund 
One isthe recognized Provident Fund,
under the payment of gratuity act 1972 
Let us now discuss about perquisites 
Secondly, where the accommodation is provided
byany other employer
number one,where the accommodation is owned by the employer 
In that case 15% of the salary
will be taxablein cities whose population
exceeding 25 lakhs as per 2001 census,
but it would be 10% of salary in cities
having population exceeding 10 lakhs but not exceeding25 lakhs
as per 2001 census 
About it will be 7 5% of salary in other cities
Number one the rent free accommodation 
in respect of the periodwhich the said accommodation is provided 
, this is the rule forunfurnished house 
for a bigger cities,
it is 15% of salary for a medium cities 
It is 10% of salaryand for other places,
it is 7 5% of salary is the valuation  And as usual, it will be increased by
10% of original cost of furniture
or actual rent on furniture in case of furnished houses 
Where the accommodation is taken on lease in that case,
actual lease amount or rent
Which is given by the employer to the employee 
or 15% of salary whichever is lower is taken as the valuation 
, all such valuation will be reduced by the amount
which is charged from the employee as rent by the employer 
In case of furnished house in all cases
10% of the original cost of furniture
or actual rent of furniturewill be added
to this valuation  where the accommodation is
provided by the employer in a hotel,
in that case 24% of the salary paid
or payableor the actual charge paid
Secondly,the concessional accommodation,
whichever is lower will be
valuation of the house or the accommodation
and it will be reduced by any amount of rent which is charged from the
employee and there is no question of
furnishing as because the accommodation is provided in a hotel 
The meaning of salary includes pay,
allowances, bonusor commission payable monthly or otherwise,
or any other monetary payments by whatever name called
from one or more employers,but it does not include
the dearness allowance or dearness pay if it is not a part of salary,
third payment by the employer in
employers contribution to provident fund,
allowances which are exempt from tax, value of perquisites,
any payment of expenditure specially excluded
under provision of Section 17(2), butthese excluding these
all other allowances, pay, bonus, commission etc 
are included for the purpose of salary
in calculatingthe valuation for rent free accommodation 
Music
respect of an obligation to the employeethat means any amount,
whichwas otherwise to be payable by the employee
is paid by the employer such benefitsor such
extra benefits which are being given by the employer to the employee
is taxable as perquisites in the hands of all employees 
Payment by the employer in respect of an obligation of an employee 
Perquisites is the extra additional benefit,
That means the any amountwhich would otherwise
have to be paid by the employee is paid by the employer,
such amount is taxable in the hands of
employee as a perquisite
and it is applicable to all kinds of employees 
I can give a small example, that if a domestic servant
is engaged by an employee at his or her own home,
and the employer reimburses the salary to the
of the servant,it means it is an obligation
which the employee would have to be discharged,
which is given by the employer
but the employer is paying the money in that case,
it is an obligation of the employee paid by employer 
The list of taxable perquisite includes
any specified security or sweat equity shares
allottedto the employee by the employer at a concessional price
or any amountof contributed
to the approved superannuation fund etc 
Perquisites exempt in all cases,
there are certain benefits or perquisites 
These are exempted from tax 
to the employeein addition to basic salary 
That is, even if these benefits are received by the employee,
these are not at all taxable  The list is long enough 
It starts with telephone,
transport facilities, refreshments etc 
Music
Let's discuss the perquisites which are taxable only
in the hands of specified employees 
Now, who are the specified employees  Specified employees,
may be one who is the director employee,
that the employee of a company who is also a director
If these benefits are given in terms of cash,
or an employee who has got substantial interest in the company,
substantial interest means any employee
who has got the beneficial ownership in equity shares
carryingvoting rights of 20% or more
and thirdly, employees drawing a salary of
rupees 50,000plus, that is income chargeable under the head
exceeds rupees 50,000  Such employees are known as
specified employees  The perquisites which are exempted
from non specified employees include service of sweeper,
gardener, watchmen, personal attendant
these are known as allowances which we have already discussed 
supply of gas electricity, water for household purposes,
education facility for employees family members,
leave travel concession, medical facility,
car or any other automotive convenience,
transport facilities by a transport undertaking 
So, for non specified employees,
this particular perquisites are exempted 
, let us discuss the valuation of perquisites 
There is a problem in perquisites,
in case of allowances, these are given in cash,
But if this is given in terms of kind
but in case of perquisites, these are given in kind 
So, when some benefits are given in kind,
there is a problem of valuation of the benefitsin terms of money 
, let's see the valuation of residential accommodation 
Music
For the purpose of computing income
chargeable under the head salary,
the valuation of perquisites provided
by the employer directly or indirectly to the employee,
employeeor any other member of household
or in kind these are known as perquisites
shall be determined in accordance with rule three
sub rule one of rule three 
Let us discuss the valuation of rent free accommodation
under different circumstances 
Number one,where the accommodation is provided by the central government
or any state governmentto the employees
either holding office or post in connection with the
affairs of Union or the state,
in that case for unfurnished house,
the valuation will be the license fee determined by the central government
or colloquially we may call it perks 
or any other state governmentin respect of
accommodationin accordance with the rules
framed by the government and as reduced by
the rent actually paid by the employee 
, it is the license fee, which is the main in case of
any government employees 
Iffurniture is also provided,
in that case 10% of the cost of furnitureor
if the furnitures are taken on rent
then actual rent will be added to the valuation 
There are some perquisites which are taxable in all cases 
Let's see the valuation of motorcar
of gift voucher or token in lieu of such gifts  It is the sum
equal to the amount have such gifts  However, if the value of
such gift or voucher is below rupees 5000 in aggregate during
the previous year, in that case, the value of perquisites will be
taken as nil  Sometimes the employer also provides or
reimburses the credit card expenses, the amount of
expenses, including membership fees, annual fees provided by
the employer or otherwise paid or reimbursed by such employer
shall be taken to the value of perquisite, chargeable to tax as
reduced by the amount, if any paid or recovered from the
employer on running and maintaining the motorcar during
employee for such benefit  However, if such expenses are
incurred wholly or exclusively for official purposes, it would
not be treated as a perquisites  Regarding the club
expenditure that any amount of expenditure incurred or
reimbursed by such employer on that account  the amount so,
determined shall be reduced by the amount if any paid or recovered from
the employee for such benefit or amenity  however,
where the employer has obtained corporate membership of the club
and the facility is enjoyed by the employee or any other member
of his household,the value of perquisite shall not include the
the relevant previous year, including remuneration if any
initial fee paid for acquiring such corporate membership 
Regarding the use of movable assets, which are facilitated by
the employer to the employee, in case of laptops and computers,
there is no valuation that is the value of perquisites
should be taken as Nil  But in case of other movable assets,
other than laptop computers, then 10% of the actual cost of
such asset or the amount of rent or charge paid that is are being
payable by the employer will be taken as the valuation of
perquisite In case of any other benefit or amenity, the value
of any other benefit or amenities, service, right or
paid by the employer to the chauffeur as increased by the
privilege provided by the employer shall be determined on
the basis of cost to the employer under an arm's length
transaction as reduced by the employees contribution, if any 
, this is a blanket provision that is made under
the Income Tax Act 1961  However, there will be no
taxable perquisite in respect of expenses on telephone, including
mobile phones, actually incurred on behalf of the employee by the
employer  That is, if an employer pays or reimburses
telephone bills, or mobile phone charges of employees, including
private uses, there will be no taxable perquisites 
amount representing normal wear and tear is charged to tax  but
 Valuation of specified security or sweat equity shares the fair market value of any
specified security or sweat equity shares being an equity
share in a company on the date on which the option is exercised
by the employee shall be the valuation where any amount has
been recovered from the employee, the same shall be
deducted to arrive at the value of perquisites  Valuation of
specified security not being an equity shares in a company  For
this purpose the fair market value of any specified security
not being an equity share of a company on the date on which the
option is exercised by the employee shall be the value as
the most complexity comes if it is used partly in performance of
determined by a merchant banker on the specified date 
duties and partly in private purposes  In that case, if the
engine of the car is up to 1 6 litre, then 1800 per month will
be the valuation of the motorcar, if the engine capacity
is more than 1600 cc or 1 6 litre capacity, in that case,
the valuation will be 2400 per month, if the chauffeur is also
when the motorcar is provided to the employee, by the employer,
given, in that case, rupees 900 per month will be added 
Additionally if the expenses of running and maintenance for
private or personal use is made by the Assessee, then the valuation
will be rupees 600 per month for cars up to 1600 cc and rupees
900 per month, for cars more than 1600 cc  Let's see the
valuation of domestic servants  the value of benefit to the
employee or any member of the household resulting from the
provision by the employer of the services of sweeper, gardener,
watchman, personnel attendant shall be the cost to the
employer and the actual cost in such case shall be the total
it is a very important perquisites   And for this particular
amount of salary paid or payable by the employer or any other
person for such services as reduced by any amount paid by
the employee for such services  But there is a note that when a
house is owned by the employer, an employer incurs the
expenditure for maintenance of garden  it is not taken as
perquisites in the hands of employee, because it is for the
upkeepment off employers house  the employer, himself or herself
has appointed the servant  It is not a personal benefit to the
employee  For validation of gas, electricity or water supplied by
the employer  If payment is made to an agency, supplying gas,
benefit, it is valued as per the rules under Income Tax Act 
electricity, water etc  The value of benefit to the employee
shall be determined as the sum equal to the amount paid on
account by the employer to the agency supplying gas,
electricity or water  If the supply is made from the
resources owned by the employer, the value of perquisites would be
the manufacturing cost per unit incurred by the employer  And if
any amount is charged from the employee that amount will be
reduced from this valuation  Valuation of free or concessional
educational facilities
 The sum equal to the amount of expenditure incurred by the
Number one where the motor car is owned or hired by the employer
employer in that behalf or if the educational institution is
maintained and owned by the employer, or if free educational
facilities are allowed in respect of educational
institutions, by reason of being in the employment of that
employer, the value of perquisites shall be determined with
reference to cost of such education in a similar
institution or in near locality, where any amount is paid or
recovered from the employee on that account  the value of
benefit shall be reduced by the amount so paid or recovered 
However, where the educational institutions itself is
and is used wholly and exclusively for the performance
maintained and owned by the employer, and free educational
facilities are provided to the children of the employee or such
free educational facilities are provided in any institutions by
reason of his or her inemployment of that employer
then there will be no perquisites , if the cost of such
education or value of such benefit per child does not
exceed rupees 1000 per month  Regarding free or concessional
tickets, value at which the benefit or amenities offered by
such employer to the public and reduced by the amount if any
paid or recovered from the employee for such benefit or
of official duties by the employee  It is not a
amenity, then this would be the valuation  But however,
there will be no such perquisites to the employees of
an airline or railways 
Valuation of other fringe benefits and amenities like
interest free or concessional loan, interest computed at the
rate charged per annum by the State Bank of India as reduced
by the interest, if any is actually paid by the employee
will be the valuation  However, no value would be charged, if
loans are made available for medical treatment in respect of
prescribed diseases like cancer, TB or where the loan amount of
perquisites at all, as the employees is not getting any particular
loans are not exceeding to the aggregate rupees 20,000 ,then
this is not a perquisites at all  Regarding traveling touring
and accommodation, if these expenses are paid or
reimbursed by the employer and if such facilities are
maintained by the employer,
or if the expenses are paid if it is an official tour, or if
the official tour is extended as vacation, the valuation will be
as per the cost incurred by the employer for extending the
benefits to the employee  Regarding the provision for
providing free or concessional food or non alcoholic beverage,
own benefit  But if it is exclusively used for private and
during the office hours in the business premises or in the
official premises, through paid vouchers, which are not
transferable and in the case it does not exceed rupees 50 per
men or if it is the tea or snacks which are provided during
the working hours, free food and non alcoholic beverage, if these
are provided in a remote area or offshore interrelations in that
case, these are exempted perquisites, that is free food
or non alcoholic beverage, if it is more than rupees 50 per meal 
In that case only it would attract the taxation and the
perquisites will be valued accordingly  Regarding the value
personal use, then actual amount of expenditure incurred by the
Before we close the discussion on perquisite, Let me refer to
2018-19  If we see the solution, the basic salary is Rs 4,86,000
allowance is also fully taxable 33,100 
Education allowance received by him is 2340 for three children,
but the exemption amount will be for two children and which comes
to Rs 1560  The exemption limit as already has been
discussed is rupees 100 per month per child for a maximum of
two children, in this case it would be 1560 and from 2340 ,1560
will be exempted and 780 rupees will be taxable  House rent
allowance he received is 46,200  But, there are three conditions
be taxable from the assessment year 2019-20 as this exemption
which is given under Section 10(13)A, number 1,actual HRA
received ,number two, excess of rent paid over 10% salary and
number 3, 40 percent of salary  If we calculate these three, we'll
find one is 170 rupees  , 170 rupees being the least amount
will be exempted from 46,200  , the balance amount of 46,030
is taxable  Reimbursement of medical expenditure exempted up
to Rs 15,000 but he has received 18,890  , balance
Rs 3890 is taxable  Reimbursement of expenditure on
books and journals for official work is not treated as a perquisite 
, the value will be nil  And regarding the car is as it is
has been withdrawn  Next, the premium paid to the effect of an
for official as well as personnel use of 1200 cc which
is less than 1600 cc  , it would be 1800 per month for 12
months and as driver is given, so, Rs 900 per month will be
chargeable extra  , total valuation of car comes 32,400
Say, if we add up the basic salary, dearness allowance, city
compensatory allowance, Education allowance, the texable
portion, house rent allowance the taxable portion, then
reimbursement of medical expenditure and valuation of
car  The gross salary comes at Rs 6,94,500 
insurance on the health of such employees  Amount paid towards
expenditure incurred outside India for medical treatment  Up
to rupees two lakhs it is not taxable, but in some cases it
may be taxable  , these are the rules for valuation of
medical facilities  , we may summarize
the deductions from salary which are available when we add up the
basic salary allowances, value of perquisites ,profits in lieu
of salary, we get the gross salary  From gross salary, the
the medical facilities when these are not taken as perquisites
deductions are available under Section 16  Number one is the
standard deduction, which is provided under Section 16,
subsection 1  it is rupees 40,000 but from assessment year
2020-21 this is increased to rupees 50,000  Second one is the
entertainment allowance under Section 16, subsection 2  It is
only available to government employees to the extent of
rupees 5000  And thirdly, it is Professional Tax, it is fully
deductible on payment basis  , from gross salary, these three
deductions are available under the head salary  Regarding
entertainment allowance as deductions, i have already
that is the value of medical treatment in any hospital
told that this is available only in case of government employees 
And the least of the following three is exempted number one,
one fifth of the basic salary, number two, entertainment allowance
actually received and thirdly, rupees 5000  the least
of these three is exempted under the head entertainment allowance
under Section 16  Professional Tax is a tax which is levied by
the state government in which the employees working  
Professional Tax or taxes on employment levied by a state
under Article 276 of the Constitution is allowed as a
deduction only when it is actually paid by the employee
maintained by the employer  Secondly, reimbursement of
during the previous year  There is a recent amendment  the
finance minister Arun Jaitley, the finance minister
introduced standard deduction in the budget of 2018-19 effective
from 2019-20 giving salaried class something to rejoice about 
The standard deduction of rupees 40,000 replaced the transport
allowance exemption of rupees 19,200 ,medical reimbursement of
rupees 15,000 per month 
,
Interestingly the provision of standard deduction was there
earlier in the finance Act 2005  And they are usually deducted
expenditure actually incurred on medical treatment at any
from the gross salary  , the government has proposed the
amendments and accordingly the standard deduction is
reintroduced  And from the assessment year 2020-21 the amount will be
rupees 50,000  Sometimes the salary is received in arrear, when
a huge amount is received in subsequent year as arrear of
salary 
The Assessee can claim relief under Section 89  And he can or she
can spread the income over the years for which the income is
actually received as an arrear salary 
Thereby,
hospital maintained by the government, local authority, any
some amount of tax can be reduced  To end
the chapter of income from salary  We can say that the
meaning of salary is different for different purposes for HRA,
for gratuity, leave encashment, RPF it means basic plus DA
or dearness pay, if it is a part of salary plus commission, if it is
given as a
fixed percentage on turnover 
but for valuation of rent free or concessional accommodation
,it is basic plus DA or dearness pay plus commission plus bonus plus fees
plus taxable allowances, monetary benefits etc  For
other hospital approved by the government for the purpose of
entertainment allowance, this is the basic only  for employees
that is under the payment of gratuity Act, it means basic
plus DA or DP,If it is received by the employee  We will see a
comprehensive problem of salary  Mr  A age of 55 years is in the
teaching staff of a private college in Bangalore owned by B
limited  During the previous year 2017-18, he gets the following
emoluments: Basic salary Rs 4,86,000 ;dearness
allowance Rs  92,300 so dearness allowance is forming
part of salary, city compensatory allowance Rs
33,100 ,children allowance Rs 2,340  he's being paid at the rate
medical treatment of its employees  reimbursement of
of Rs 65 per month for three children, house rent allowance
Rs 46,000 ,rent paid Rs 58,000 and remuneration from
Bangalore University for acting as paper setter and examiner Rs
86,400  expenditure incurred by Mr A ,in this regard is Rs 3400 
he gets Rs 18,890 as reimbursement from the employer
in respect of expenditure incurred on medical treatment of
his family members from a doctor  Besides, he gets Rs 12,600 as
reimbursement from employer in respect of books and journals
purchased by him for discharging his official work  The employer
provides 1200 cc car for official and private purposes 
expenditure actually incurred for medical treatment to the
The entire expenditure on salary of driver and running and
maintenance of car, which approximately comes to Rs
92,300 is borne by the employer  He contributes 11% of his salary
in recognized provident fund, to which a matching contribution is
made by the employer  During the year ,he spends Rs 3000 on
purchase of books for teaching purposes, but this amount is not
reimbursed by employer  Besides he makes an expenditure of
Rs 60,000 as insurance Premium of own life insurance
policy since 2015, sum assured being Rs 15 lakhs 
determine the gross salary of Mr A for the assessment year
extent of rupees 15,000  But Incidentally, this amount will
under the head income from House property 
, if we see the definition 
We get four conditions for the chargeability 
Number one, the property should consist of any building
or land appurtenant thereto 
Number two, the Assessee must be the owner of the property 
That means, if he or she is not the owner of the property 
The income will not come under the head income from House property 
Suppose, a person has taken a property on rent
and it has been sublet to some other person,then,
Welcome learners This week we will be learning income from
the income from subletting will not come under the head
income from House property as because
the Assessee is not the owner of the property 
it would be treated under income from other sources 
Third condition the property may be used for any purpose,
but it should not be used by the owner  For the purpose of any business
or profession, carried on by him,
the profit of which is chargeable to tax 
In such case such income will come under
the profits and gains of business or profession 
House property, section 22 to 27 of the Income Tax Act
And fourthly, property held as stock in trade for first one year,
the annual value will be taken as nil  ,these are the condition for
chargeability for any income to be included under
the income from House property  Before we go for any other discussion,
let us clear one concept called composite rent 
The owner of a property may sometimes receive rent in respect of building
as well as the other assets like say furniture,
plant and machinery, or for different purposes for the services
provided in the building  For example, lift, security,
power, backup, etc  The amount so received is known as
are devoted to income from House property 
composite rent , what is the tax treatment for composite rent,
the composite rent has to be split up in two parts 
Number one, the sum attributable to the use of property
is to be assessed under Section 22 as income from house property,
that means any income which is related to the property itself 
And number two, the sum attributable to the use of
services is to be charged to tax under the head profits and gains
from business or profession or any other or the head under
income from other sources as the case may be 
, there is a problem of splitting up of the composite rent,
, to be eligible to come under the head income from house property,
if the let out building and the other assets are inseparable
in that case, the income prom composite rent
will not come under the head income from House property,
but if the the let out of building and other assets are separable,
then the building part will come under the head
income from House property and the use of other assets,
the income from use of other assets will come under the head
either profits and gains of business or profession
or income from other sources  Income from house property situated outside India 
, if a person receives income from House property,
any income must satisfy certain conditions,
Which is situated outside India, in case of a resident in India 
That is in case of a resident and ordinarily resident
income from property situated outside India is taxable 
Whether such income is received in India brought to India or not,
but in case of non resident or resident but not already resident in India 
Income from property situated outside India
is taxable only if it is received in India 
Before we see the computation of income tax for house property income 
Let's see what are the house property income which are exempt from tax 
There are certain incomes which are earned from house property
Which are given under Section 22 of the Act 
but are exempted from tax number one , income from farm house
that is, it is an agricultural income  it is not taxable 
Secondly, income of one palace of an ex ruler,
we had different ex rulers before annexation to India 
the Government of India when the Income Tax Act was enacted 
It was decided that the ex ruler will be given a choice 
any one palace of an ex ruler will be exempted from income tax 
Then property income of a local authority,
property income of an approved Scientific Research Association 
Property income of university or educational institutions,
It says the annual value of any property
property income of hospital or medical institutions,
property income of a trade union, house property held for charitable purposes
Property income of a political party ,
property used for business or profession 
And lastly, one self occupied property
from Assessment year 2020 -21  It will be too
self occupied property held by the Assessee 
, these are the house properties whose incomes are
explicitly exempted from tax under the Income Tax Act 
comprising of buildings or land appurtenant thereto
of which the assessee is the owner is chargeable to tax
under Section 23, the determination of annual value 
There are deductions under Section 24, subsection 1
and there are two deductions  Number one standard deduction 
Which is 30% of the nav , discuss in detail,
an interest on borrowed capital 
When these two deductions are made from net annual value 
We get ultimately the income from House property 
, let's see the determination of annual value
for different types of house properties 
Before we see the different types of house properties and its determination 
That has clear one concept called expected rent 
The determination of annual value goes for
Expected rent is actually dependent on three factors or three figures,
so to say, number one municipal valuation 
We will mention it as MV in our further discussions 
Secondly, fair rent of the property 
Fair rent says that what is the normal rate of such
kind of property in the locality and standard rent of the
property SR  standard rate is if the rent control Act
is enforced, then the standard rent of the property
and expected rent is the higher of municipal valuation or fair rent
subject to maximum of standard rent, the expected rent
calculation of net annual value or NAV,
cannot exceed standard rent, it is the higher of municipal valuation and fair rent 
, let's see a situation where the property is let out
throughout the previous year In that case, the gross annual value
will be the higher of expected rent and actual rent
received or receivable during the year 
Let us take one example  Suppose there are five houses, house one, house two,
house three, house four and house five and we have municipal value 
Municipal value of house one is 80,000, house two 35,000,
house three 65000, house four, 24,000 and house five ,80,000 
In this way, the fair rent 90,000 ,60,000, 65,000 ,25,000, 75,000 
which is the gross annual value minus municipal tax paid in the previous year 
standard rent suppose in case of house one standard rate is not
applicable because rent control Act is not applicable in that locality 
But for house two there is a standard rent of 75,000
house three is 58,000, house four suppose standard rent
is not applicable because when Control Act is not applicable,
and house five,78000then actual rent received or receivable
in case of house one ,72000 in case of house two ,72000
in case of house three, 60000, in case of house four, 30,000,
in case of house five,72000 
Now, from this example, if we want to calculate the
But let us see in detailand let us see the format of
expected rent and GAV Then how should we do
that first let us plot the municipal valuation
and then it is the fair rent 
In case of house one the municipal value is rupees 80,000,
fair rent is 90,000  , higher of one and two that is municipal valuation
and fair rent is 90,000, standard rent is not applicable
in that case expected rent will be
higher is number three higher of one and two
that is rupees 90,000 and actual rent received and receivable is 72,000 
, gross annual value will be higher of expected rent and actual rent
computation of income from House property
that is 90,000 and 72000  Higher of these two is 90,000 
Taking the example for house two, municipal valuation is 55,000 
Fair rent is 60,000 So, higher of one and two,
that is 60,000, standard rent is 75,000 
, expected rent is higher of one and two is 60,000 
It cannot exceed the standard rent that is 70,000 ,75,000 
, expected rent will be 60,000 
Actual rent received is 72,000  , gross annual value is
higher of expected rent and actual rent it comes 72,000 
,In this way, there are house three, house four and house five 
as the format shows, it starts with gross annual value,
Suppose in case of house five, the higher of municipal valuation
and fair rent is 80,000 but standard rent is 78,000 
, the expected rent is 78,000  It cannot exceed standard rent 
Actual rent is 72,000  , gross annual value in case of house Five
is rupees 78,000  , this is an example 
And we think that this example will make clear
the concept that is how gross annual value is determined 
from gross annual value, municipal tax is deducted
, when municipal tax is deducted from gross annual value,
we get the net annual value  From net annual value 
If we see again the steps 
This is the case of property held as stock in trade 
In case of house property, A portion is let out and
portion is self occupied  Income from any portion of a property
which is let out shall be computed
separately under the let out property category
and the portion of our part, which is self occupied
shall be computed under the self occupied category 
There is no need to treat the whole property as a single unit
for computation of income from House property 
Municipal valuation, fair rent, standard rent,
the actual rent received or receivable, unrealized rent,
if not given separately shall be apportioned
between the let out portion and self occupied portion
either on plinth area or built up space
or on such other reasonable basis 
Property taxes or municipal taxes if given
on a consolidated basis can be bifurcated, as attributed to
each portion or floor on a reasonable basis 
In Many cases, the discussions which we have carried out so far,
the income is taken as a notional income instead of real income 
Thus under this kind of income 
period of months in that particular period it is taken as 12 months for each cases
There are circumstances where notional income is charged
to tax instead of real income 
For example, the Assessee owns more than one house property 
Where one house property or two house property or as the case may be,
will be taken as self occupied
and the gross annual value will be taken as Nil 
Other house properties will be taken as deemed to be let out
and their gross annual value will be charged separately as the expected rent 
What they expected rent is the notional income,
as in the case of later property also if the expected rent exceeds
and loss due to vacancy are given for five house property 
the actual rent, then the expected rent is the GAV
and expected rent is of course notional 
In case of a house property, as a stock held as a stock in trade 
, the income has to be computed on notional basis
by taking the expected rent as the GAV after one year,
from the financial year, in which certificate of completion of construction
of the property is given 
Namely A ,B, C, D, E  , in this example, we have taken
a loss due to vacancy as well as unrealized rent 
, our purpose is to see how
the gross annual value is calculated when
there are standard rent is present, unrealized rent is there
and also there is a vacancy allowance 
, if we see that how it is being determined in step one 
Step one, we have to find out the reasonable expected rent of the property 
We will find out the expected rent,
which is the higher of municipal valuation and fair rent 
Which shows like this for five house properties A B, C, D, E 
Step two, we will see rent received after deducting the unrealized rent 
, we will deduct the unrealized rent from
the actual rent received and these are the figures 
Step three ,higher of step one And step two,
and accordingly in case of house A, it is 108000 ,house B 110,000,
house C, 89000, house D, 112,000, house E, 108000 
Step four we have to see lost due to vacancy
Step two, find out the rent actually received or receivable
in 1st house there is no loss, 2nd house ,2000,
3rd house 3000, 4th house 4000, and 5th house there is no loss of vacancy 
, GAV the gross annual value is step three minus step four 
,in case of house one,we see it house one,108000,house B,it is 108000,
house C is 86,000, house D 108000 and house E 108000 
, this example should clear the concept of expected rent,
the rent received after deduction of unrealized rent
and also the treatment of loss due to vacancy 
Second condition where let out property is vacant for part of the year 
That is where let out property is
from here we will deduct the unrealized rent 
vacant for part of the year owing to the vacancy,
The actual rent is lower than the expected rent 
Then the actual rent received or receivable is the gross annual value 
but the expected rent and received or receivable
is lower than the year because of the vacancy 
Then only expected actual rent received or receivable will be the GAV 
In other cases, if the actual rent received or receivable
is more in that case, it will be taken as the GAV 
In case of self occupied property or unoccupied property 
what is an unoccupied property  the expression unoccupied property
But it is before deducting the loss due to vacancy 
refers to a property,which cannot be occupied by the owner
by reason of his employment or business or profession at a different place 
And he resides in such other place
as in a building not belonging to him, in that case
it the house property will be taken as unoccupied property 
, where the property is self-occupied for own residence
or unoccupied throughout the previous year, the Annual value
will be taken as Nil , provided no other benefit
is derived by the owner from such property 
The benefit of exemption of one self occupied house
Step three, find out which one is higher 
is available only to individual or HUF and now this will be to
self occupied house for assessment year 2020 -21 and no deduction
for municipal Taxes is allowed  in respect of such property,
whose annual value is taken as nil  ,
where a house property is let out for part of the year
and self occupied for part of the year
that is, if a single unit of a property
is self occupied for part of the year
and let out for the remaining part of the year 
Then the expected rent for the whole year
Step four, find out the loss due to vacancy
shall be taken into account for determining the gross annual value 
The expected rent of the whole year shall be compared
with the actual rent for the let out period
and whichever is higher shall be taken as gross annual value 
However, the municipal tax for the whole year is allowed to be deducted
provided it is paid by the owner during the previous year 
In case of deemed to be let out property 
It is given Under Section 23, subsection 4,
that where the assessee owns more than one property,
or two properties as the case may be from assessment year 2020-21 
and Step five is step three minus Step four,and which will actually give us
For self occupation,then the income of
any such property at the option of the Assessee
shall be computed self occupied property, and the annual value will be taken as Nil 
The other self occupied or unoccupied properties
shall be treated as deemed to be let out properties 
The option can be changed year after year
in a manner which is beneficial to the Assessee 
In case of a house property which is held as stock in trade 
Section 23, subsection 5, deals with this,
the gross annual value  Let us take one example,
that in some cases, property consisting of any building
or land appurtenant thereto may be held a stock in trade
and the whole or any part of the property may not be let out during the
whole or any part of the previous year 
In such cases, the annual value of such property
or part of the property shall be taken as Nil 
The benefit would be available for the period up to one year
from the end of the financial year,
in which certificate of completion of construction of the property
is obtained from the competent authority 
where the municipal valuation, the fair rent,the standard rent,
let's see the treatment of unrealized rent 
for the amount which he could not collect from the tenant 
He has to satisfy four conditions  Number one,it is to be proved that
the tenancy is bona fide that is the agreement between the landlord
and the tenant was made in good faith  Number two,
the defaulting tenant has vacated, the property or steps have been
taken to compel him to vacant the property  Number three,
the defaulting tenant is not has vacated the property as well as
is not in occupation of any other property of the Assessee 
And fourthly, the Assessee has taken all reasonable steps
to institute legal proceedings for the recovery of the unpaid rent,
It is an addition to the explanation given under Section 23  subsection 1 
or satisfies the assessing officer that the legal proceedings would be useless,
and it means that throwing good money for bad money 
, let's see about the property taxes, municipal taxes 
Which is allowed as a deduction from gross annual value 
Property taxes are allowable as deduction from the gross annual value
subject to two conditions, number one, it must be borne by
the Assessee or the owner  if it is borne by the tenant,
then it cannot be claimed as deduction from the gross annual value
and number two, it should be paid during the previous year 
, the municipal taxes are allowed on the basis on the payment basis 
The amount of rent received or receivable
, if the property taxes levied by a local authority
for a particular previous year is not paid during the year,
no deduction shall be allowed  But if the payment is made
for the past years, that is the area taxes or if it is paid for the
future years that is advance, payment of tax 
All these are deductible provide on the basis of the payment 
, in case of property situated outside India,
taxes levied by local authority of the country
in which the property is situated is deductible 
, this is the municipal tax, which is deductible on payment basis
should not include any amount of rent, which is not capable of being realized 
and the payment must be made by the owner
and the expenses of the taxes is to be borne by the owner
then only it can be deducted from gross annual value 
, there are certain deductions general deductions,
like in case of salaries, we have seen this section 16 
In case of house property, it is section 24 
There was reforms in house property income earlier the list was long enough,
but now, there are only two items, which are there 
Under Section 24, number one standard deduction
and number two interest on borrowed capital 
As we say that in case of bad debt, which is a deductible
Regarding standard deduction,
there is a flat deduction and is allowed irrespective
of the expenditure incurred earlier before reforms,
ground rent,collection charges, etc The list was long enough,
which the Assessee used to claim  But now there is no such other deductions,
a standard deduction is given and the Assesseewill be
ours is given 30% of the net annual value as a reduction 
But this deduction is not available in case of self occupied property
or in case of any property held stock in trade 
which is not let out during the whole or any part of the year up
expense under Section 37 of the Income Tax Act 
to one year from the end of the financial year 
,this is something about the standard deduction,
which is 30% of the net annual value 
, let us see the interest on borrowed capital 
Interest on borrowed capital is allowed
as a deduction under Section 24 Subsection B 
Interest payable on loans borrowed for the purpose of acquisition,
construction, repairs, renewal
or reconstruction can be claimed as a deduction Interest payable on
fresh loan taken to repay the original loan raised earlier
Unrealized rent is also deductible
for the aforesaid purposes is also
allowed or admissible as a deduction 
There is a concept of pre construction period interest 
normally loan is taken and the interest is payable
during the construction period also, when the property is not
available for any income, the property is not ready for earning income 
, for the pre construction period, that is the period
prior to the previous year in which the property is acquired or
construction is completed interest payable on borrowed
capital for the period prior to the previous year
provided certain conditions as prescribed in rule four are satisfied 
in which the property has been acquired or constructed,
that is the pre-construction period interest can be claimed as deduction
over a period of five years in equal annual installments,
commencing from the year of acquisition or completion of construction 
, interest for the year in which the construction is completed,
that is the interest relating to the year of completion of
construction can be fully claimed in that year
irrespective of the date of completion, but in case of
pre construction period, it is one fifth that is
for a period of five years, it can be deducted in equal annual installments 
, what are the conditions that when an assessee
wishes to claim deduction for unrealized rent
, in case of deduction in respect of
Deduction at the rate of 30% under standard deduction is allowable
and it is taxable even if the assessee is not the owner of
the property in the financial year of received or realization 
There is a confusion regarding co-owned property 
Section 26,makes ample try to make it clear to the assessees
that where the property is owned by two or more person
and whose shares are definite and ascertainable than, the income from
such property cannot be taxed as income of an AOP 
The share of income of each of Co owner is determined in accordance with
section 22 to 25 and is included in the individual assessment 
acquisition or construction, the maximum limit is rupees two lakhs 
In case of flats where the house property is owned by co owners,
and its self occupied by each of the co-owners,
the annual value of each of the co-owner will be nil 
And each co-owner shall be entitled to a deduction of
rupees 30,000 or rupees two lakhs,
as the case may be under Section 24 Subsection B
on account of interest on borrowed capital 
And where the house property owned by the co-owner is let out
and the income from such property shall be computed
as if the property is owned by one owner
If a certificate is also produced, but if the loan is taken ,
and thereafter the income,so computed shall be
apportioned among each co owner as per, the specific share 
Section 27 of the Act talks about the deemed ownership 
, as per section 27 the persons though not legal owners
of a property are deemed to be the owners of for the purpose of
Section 22 to Section 26  Like transfer to a spouse
transfer to a minor child, holder of an impartible estate,
member of a cooperative society,person in possession of
a property, though not a legal owner and person having right
in a property for a period of less than 12 years will be taken as
even if after 1499 for the purpose of repair, renewal,
the deemed owner But however, in case of person having right
in a property for less than 12 years,
in case of the person acquiring the rights,by way of lease from month to month
or for a period of not exceeding one year 
Such person will not be treated as legal owner 
As we have told you that we are learning these things
for accurate tax calculations  
As well as to save some amount of tax 
Let's see there are certain tax planning hints 
Like prior to financial year 2019 -20 
construction, reconstruction etc 
If more than one self occupied household is owned by the taxpayer,
only one house is considered and treated as a self occupied property
and the remaining house are to be taken to be let out 
The choice of the property to choose as self occupied
is up to the tax payerand from the assessment year 2019 -20 onwards 
The benefit of considering the house as self occupied
has been extended to two houses 
, an assessee can claim
his two properties of self occupied and remaining
as let out for income tax purposes 
Then the maximum amount of interest that can be claimed is rupees 30,000 only 
If the interest is paid out of India, tax is to be deducted 
, be careful when pay interest paid out of India 
Municipal taxes is paid on payment basis 
, try to pay the municipal tax and claim the deduction on the year of payment 
Interest payable on outstanding installments 
It may be claimed as deduction under Section 24 
Even if it is not paid 
, the rupees two lakhs is the enhanced amount of
deduction that can be claimed
Under interest on borrowed capital  if the loan is taken
after 1499 and the property is that is the loan is taken for
acquisition or construction  for the purpose of
one self occupied property  Where the annual value is taken as nil
claiming deduction for rupees two lakhs, the assessee should furnish
a certificate from the person to whom any interest is payable
on the capital borrowed specifying the amount of
interest payable by the assessee for the purpose of such acquisition
or construction of the property 
, there is the ceiling of rupees 30,000 or rupees two lakhs,
this does not apply to the let out or deemed to be let out property,
then is the ceiling prescribed for the self occupied property
is not applicable to deemed to be let out property
or let out property that in those cases, there is no limit 
or the two self occupied property from the assessment year 2020 -21 
Interest is allowable on accrual basis not on payment basis
that is deduction under Section 24 (b)
for interest is available on an accrual basis 
If benefit is not paid, it can be claimed as deduction 
An unpaid purchase price would also be considered as
capital borrowed and interest paid on unpaid interest is not deductible 
, these are the some of the issues in case of
interest on borrowed capital  If we see the deductions
from income from House property, we can see it under two categories 
One is for the let out property
The Assessee will be allowed a deduction on account of interest
and the other is for the Self occupied property property  
For let out property, there are two deduction,
standard deduction under Section 24, subsection a 
Which is 30% of the net gross annual value
and for interest on borrowed capital,
there is no limit if the house is let out or deemed to be let out 
For self occupied property, we have to see
if the house is purchased before 1-4-1999
or after 1-4-1999  in case a house is self occupied
and the loan is taken for reconstruction, repair ,renewals etc 
including one fifth of the accumulated interest of the pre-construction period 
The maximum limit is rupees 30,000  If the house is taken for construction
for acquisition, then we have to see whether the loan is taken
before 1-4-1999 or after 1-4-1999  If the loan is taken before 1-4-1999,
then it is 30,000  But if it is taken after 1-4-1999
in that case, the loan that is the interest can be claimed up to rupees two lakhs 
, let's see the computation of income from House property
for a let out property  From our earlier discussion if we again
recapitulate the discussion ,step one, we have to compute the expected rent 
Expected rent is the higher of municipal valuation and fair rent,
but it is restricted to standard rent 
Under two categories, number one,
Step two, let us compute the actual rent received or receivable 
From here we will deduct unrealized rent if any 
Step three is the gross annual value, which is the higher of expected rent
and actual rent received or receivable 
If the actual rent received is less than the expected rent because of
vacancy, then AR is the gross annual value 
But if actual rent is less than expected rent because of some other reason,
then expected rent will be the gross annual value 
Step three, the gross annual value is the higher of expected rent or actual rent 
Step four, we have to deduct municipal tax,
if the loan borrowed before loan is borrowed, before 1499,
then we get the net annual value 
Step six, we deduct deductions under Section 24(1) 
, there are two deductions as we have already discussed
standard deduction which is 30% of the net annual value
and interest on borrowed capital 
These two are deducted from net annual value and step seven, we get
the income from House property  self occupied property or
unoccupied property, Here the annual value is taken as nil 
, here only deduction under Section 24(1),
there is only one deduction, interest on borrowed capital is given
then the maximum amount of interest that can be taken as deduction is rupees 30,000 
and as we have already told that if it is the loan is taken for
repair ,renewals, reconstruction etc  The maximum interest is
a restricted to Rs 30,000  But if it is taken for
construction or purchase of the house acquisition of the house
and if the loan is taken prior to 1-4-1999 ,maximum is Rs 30,000,
but if it is taken after 1-4-1999, in that case,
It is rupees two lakhs will be the maximum amount
but provided the construction is completed within the five years
from the end of the financial year in which the capital was borrowed 
Section 25 talks about certain inadmissible deductions
If the loan is borrowed on or after 1499 
that is interest chargeable under this act 
Which is payable outside India shall not be deducted if
tax has not been paid or deducted from such interest 
And there is no such person in India
who may be treated as an agent 
In that case, the interest cannot be taken as deduction 
There is a provision for arrearsof rent
and unrealized rent received subsequently,
section 25, subsection A  So, if unrealized rent or any arrear is received,
It is taxable in the year of receipt/realization 
The actual amount payable and it is for the purpose of
Let us discuss one comprehensive problem
Higher is 3,50,000, but a standard rent is applicable here 
It cannot exceed standard rent, but in this case standard rent is five lakhs,
which is much much higher than the higher of
fair rent and municipal valuation 
,out of 3,20,000 and 3,50,000 the higher
3,50,000 will be the expected rent of the property 
Step two we have to see the rent received or receivable
after deducting unrealized rent, but before adjusting loss due to vacancy 
, here we have seen that rent received by
in case of house two is 4,20,000
The houses were vacant for certain period of months
an unrealized rent for the previous year is deductible it is 80,000
, 4,20,000 minus 80,000 we get 3,40,000 
Step three ,will be amount computed in step one and step two whichever is higher 
, out of 350,000 and 3,40,000,
higher is 3,50,000 , we deduct the loss due to vacancy 
Loss due to vacancy here it is clearly given as rupees 1,40,000 
, we deduct loss due to vacancy 1,40,000
, in step five we get gross annual value for house two
in step three minus Step four 2,10,000 
From here we have to deduct the municipal tax 
during the previous year  House one was vacant for two months,
Which is paid by the landlord and also borne by the landlord 
It is deducted on payment basis 
, 50,000 is deducted we get the net annual value as 1,60,000 
From net annual value there are deductions available under Section 24 
Two deductions  Number one,standard deduction that is 30% of the net annual value
that is 30% of 1,60,000 it is 48,000
and interest on borrowed capital as the borrowed capital is
taken for the construction of house two 
, it is allowable for house two 
, it is 1,40,000 ,in 140,000 total is
house two for four months  ,he has shown the
1,88,000 we deduct from 1,60,000 which is the net value
net annual value , that deductions are more in that case
we will get a negative income from house two,
house two income from house two will be minus 28,000 
If we calculate the gross total income of Mr  A 
, income from House property, house one
is 3,15,000,house two is minus 28,000, his income from
house property comes at 2,78,000 his business income
or income from profits and gains of business or profession is 10,82,000 
ultimately, we get the gross total income as 13,69,000 
calculation on loss of account of vacancy
municipal taxes paid,then repairs, insurance,
land revenue, ground rent, etc 
Interest on borrowed capital by a mortgage house 
he has mortgage house number one
Direct_Tax_2317
and interest on borrowed capital  The funds are used for
of income from house property
construction of house number two It's 1,40,000
and the nature of occupation is the house one is
for let out residents  House two is let out for business 
We have to determine the gross total income
of Mr  A for the assessment year 2018 -19 
Just have a look on the figures again
,let us see the solutions to the problem
first house one to calculate the gross annual value 
We first have to know the reasonable expected rent of the property 
For the assessment year 2018 -19 Mr  A submits
, step one we have to find out the reasonable
expected rent of the property, what is the higher of
municipal value or fair rent?
But if standard rent is there,
then it would be restricted to standard rent 
, if we see, in case of house one
fair rent is 3,50,000  Municipal value is 3,60,000
while standard rent is three lakh 
, higher of fair rent and municipal valuation is 3,60,000
but a standard rent is three lakhs 
the following information, his income from business
, the reasonable expected rental property will be three lakhs 
In step two, we will see the rent received and receivable
after deducting unrealized rent, but before adjusting the loss of vacancy,
if we see in case of house one, the rent is six lakhs rupees
and the unrealized rent is 10,000  ,
when we deduct 10,000 from six lakhs, we get 5,90,000 
while deducting unrealized rent we presume that
all conditions that are necessary for getting these deductions are satisfied 
, these conditions, we should know that
the tenancy was bonafide,
is rupees 10,82,000and he gives details of his property income 
the owner has put all efforts to collect the money 
The tenant has vacated the property and the tenant has
not in occupation of any other property of the owner 
, if such conditions are fulfilled,then unrealized rent can be deducted 
In this case, we presume all these conditions are satisfied 
Step three, the amount computed in step one and step two, whichever is higher 
So, out of three lakh and five lakh ninty thousand ,
five lakh ninty thousand is higher 
, from here if there is a vacancy loss 
We will deduct it in this case there is a loss of one lakh rupees,
He has two houses house one and house two 
,we deduct one lakh from Five lakh ninty thousand 
, we get four lakh ninty thousand, which is the gross annual value
of house one  We think that you should have a fairly good idea
for calculation of gross annual value when unrealized rent as well as
vacancy loss are there  ,
once we have calculated the gross annual value,
that we deduct the municipal tax,
municipal tax here given is 40,000 
One condition to be remembered in case of deduction of municipal tax that it is
deductible on payment basis not on due basis 
He has given the details of fair rent
If the municipal tax is paid in the year in which it is paid
in that year it is eligible for deduction 
It may be paid in advance it will be paid for past years 
But the condition is that it must be paid and secondly
the it must be borne by the landlord, if it is borne by the
tenant then the deduction is not available 
, when we deduct municipal tax from gross annual value,
We get net annual value  , there are general deductions
Under Section 24 which are available
in the head income from House property 
Municipal valuation,standard rent actual rent,
There are two deductions available under Section 24 
One is standard deduction,which is 30% of rupees 450,000 
, the rule is 30% of the net annual value 
, here 30% of rupees 4,50,000 is 1,35,000
Another deduction under section 24 is interest on borrowed capital 
Here, Mr  A has borrowed funds on the mortgage of house one
but he has used the loan for construction of house number two,
, this reduction is not available for
house number one simply because the house number one was mortgaged for the loan 
, the interest deductible here
unrealized rent of the previous year 2017-18 
for house number one is nil  , total deduction under Section 24
is 1,35,000 , when you deduct this 1,35,000
from net annual value 4,50,000 we get income from house one as 315,000 
, let us see the calculation for house two
we have to calculate the gross annual value 
,for calculation of gross annual value, we will go
step one, step two,step three, step four, step five like this 
Step one, we have to find out the reasonable expected rent of the property 
Which is fair rent or municipal value whichever is higher 
In this case fair rent is 3,20,000 Municipal valuation is 3,50,000 
Unrealized rent of the previous year 2016-17 
Computation of depreciation is dependent on certain factors 
And, number one, it is the block of assets,number two
written down value ,number three actual cost 
Depreciation is available in case of intangible assets
according to the 'straight line method', while in case of other assets,
It is on the written down value method 
What are the block of assets? block of assets has got different groups,
tangible assets being building ,machinery, plant or furniture,
intangible assets being know how, patents ,copyrights, trademarks, licenses
franchises etc  Income tax Act provides
requiring some degree of learning 
different depreciation rates for different block off assets  like building
if it is residential building the depreciation rate is 5%
if building is used in office or factory, it is 10%,
If building is the temporary erection etc  It is 40% 
it is block one, block two, block three  In case of block four
furniture including electric fittings, the normal rate is 10% 
And in case of plant and machinery, the general rate is 15% 
But plant and machinery in case of ocean going ships is 20% 
plant and machinery in case of buses lorries etc  is 30%
Plant and machinery in case of aeroplanes or computers it is 40%
The term profession includes vocation as well
and the block nine deals with the intangible assets
where the general repreciation rate is 25% 
Then we have to see the computation of written down value 
We can take an example of computation of written down value of an asset
for the assessment year 2018-19  Step one, were have to find out
the depreciated value of the block on April one 2017 
Step two, where to add the actual cost of the assets, which are
acquired during the previous year in during that particular year 2017-18 
And step three, we had to deduct the money received or receivable
in respect of the asset which is sold, discarded,
as defined in section two subsection 36 
demolished or destroyed during the previous year 
Like a painter, a sculptor, an author,
a chartered accountant or auditor, a lawyer,
a doctor, an architect, or even an astrologer
are the persons who can be said to be carrying on
a profession, but not the business 
However, it is not material whether a person is carrying a business
or profession or vocation since, for the purpose of assessment,
Welcome learners, This week we will learnt a very important head
profits are income of all these sources, are treated and taxed
alike  Besides necessarily means
a continuous exercise of activity,
nevertheless, profits from a single venture
in the nature of trade may also be treated as business 
, the term profits when we talk about in
profits and gains of business and profession 
The profits includes any income earned in cash or in kind ,
capital receipts or it may be involuntary receipts 
Its application of the gains
of income, that is profits and gains of business and profession 
in the trade whether it is immaterial and the
Income Tax Act also does not consider about the
legality or illegality of the income  even income earned
from illegal business is subject to tax 
An income from distinguished businesses are also taxed in separately
and ultimately we get the computation of profits 
In case of method of accounting, there is a tax accounting standard
and ICDS, that stands for income disclosure and tax accounting standards 
Section 28 of the Income Tax Act
discusses the income chargeable under this head,
It is known as PGBP  The meaning of business and
and it includes income from business, profession or vocation,
any compensation or any other payment due to or received by the Assessee,

like profits on import entitlement,
cash assistance against exports under any scheme of government of India 
Customs duty or excise duty, repaid or repayable as a duty drawback scheme,
profits on transfer of duty entitlement passbook scheme,
or duty free replenishment certificate all these are taken as business income
profession have been defined in the Income Tax Act 
and value of any benefit or perquisite
or any sum due to or received by a partner of a firm 
Which is chargeable under this head,
any sum received under keyman insurance policy 
Sum received on a acount of capital asset referred
to under Section 35AD  or any sum,
whether received or receivable
in cash or in kind under an agreement 
, while discussing the income for business or profession 
There is a term called speculative business 
The term business has been defined in section 2 subsection 13
, speculative business means,
a transaction in which a contract for the purchases
or sales of any commodity including stock and shares,
is periodically or ultimately settled
otherwise than by actual delivery
or transfer of the commodity or scrips 
such transactions are known as Speculative Transactions 
Transactions not deemed to be speculative transactions include
hedging contract in respect of raw materials, or merchandise 
Hedging contracts in respect of stock and shares,
and which includeany trade, commerce or manufacture
forward contract, trading in derivatives, trading in commodity derivatives, etc 
, let's see the computation of income from business 
Section 29  deals in a computation of income from
business or profession  While, section 30 to 37
deals with admissible deductions 
Section 40 deals with inadmissible deductions 
Section 40 A deals with expenses or payments, not deductible
on certain circumstances  Section 41 deals with profits chargeable to tax
and there are certain other provisions 
, section 32 to section 37 deals with admissible deductions 
or any adventure or concern in the nature of trade,
Like section 30 deals with rent, rates, repairs,
insurance for buildings, section 31
repairs and insurance of machinery, plant and furniture 
Section 32 deals with depreciation,section 32AD
deals with manufacturing industries set up in notified backward areas
of specified states that are eligible for a deduction
at the rate of 15% of the actual cost of new plant and machinery
acquired and installed during the previous year 
Before we go for other sections, section 32 needs to be elaborately discussed 
Section 32 deals with depreciation
commerce or manufacture  While the term profession
, there are certain conditions for claiming depreciation 
Depreciation is a very important deduction for income from business or profession 
Number one condition says that the asset must be owned by the assessee 
If the asset is not owned by the assessee 
If it is taken on lease or some other agreement 
It will not qualify for deduction for depreciation
then it must be used for the purpose of business or profession 
It should be used during the relevant previous year
and depreciation is available on tangible as well as intangible goods 
has not been defined in the Act, but it means an occupation
Let us discuss a problem on depreciation
of three buildings with cost during the year 7,28,700
and there is a sale of building L with 6,00,000 
,the written down value on March 31 is 8,38,900
block C with building rate of depreciation at the rate of 40% 
, the depreciated value we get at 16,90,000 
block seven we have furniture rate of depreciation with 10%
and there is a new cost that is which is being purchased at 56,000 
, total written down value is 56,000 
And then the block eight with the copyright rate of depreciation with 25%
and there was no opening balance, but we had a
is rupees 12,40,000  2nd block of plant again,
purchase this time 17,50,000  written down value is 17,50,000 
but there are two plants now D and E,
but this falls under the group of 40% depreciation
as a depreciated value of 2,60,000 
Plant F is the third block as the rate of depreciation is 30%
and the opening balance is 70,000 
,We have got three blocks of building Building A, B, C and D,
which fall in 10% depreciation rate 
We have a opening balance of 10,90,600 
another block of building E ,F, G, that is 5% block
Compute the written down value
and the depreciated value on the beginning of the year is 7,10,200 
And the last one is building H,I, J and k,
which comes under 40% depreciation and opening value for 16,90,000 
, after the april 1, 2017 
The company purchases certain assets
and accordingly the assets are categorized
as per rate of depreciation 
First one they had purchased Plant G  the date of purchase is
given as April 6 2017 ,rate of depreciation is 30%
at a cost of 6000  Plant H is purchased on May 11 2017
from the following information for the assessment year 2018 -19 
rate of depreciation 15% amount is 18,000 
Furniture on June 6 2017,Rate of depreciation 10%
actual cost 56,000  Car July 7 2017 rate of depreciation 15%
actual cost is 2,56,000  then there is a Building L,
it is purchased on September 26, 2017,
With a rate of depreciation 5% it is cost at 7,20,700 
Computer September 27, 2017 rate of depreciation is 40%
actual cost is 90,000  copyright September 30, 2017,
rate of depreciation 25% and actual cost is 17,50,000 
During the year, some assets are transferred 
We have block of assets,
, this list is also given  Plant B which was originally there 
It was sold on December 20,2017 at a price of 25,10,900 
Plan Dwas also sold on January 31 2018,
at a consideration of 12,000  building L
was sold on March 6 2018 at a sale consideration of
rupees six lakhs  ,these are the information
which are given and this is an idea
by which the written down value of assets can be calculated 
First we need the opening balance of different assets
as per block   We categorize as per
Six block of assets, the rate of depreciation,
nature of the asset as well as the rate of depreciation 
And also we need the details of purchases during the year
which we have already got  And the list of the assets which are transferred
during the year which we have also received 
, let's see the solution  How it can be
Calculated ?ultimately how can we calculate the written down value
of assets for different blocks 
, we have to calculate as per block wise
We will first see plant and machinery 
The block which had the depreciation rate of 15% 
percent as well as depreciation value on April 1, 2017 are given 
,block 1 plant and machinery rate of depreciation 15% 
Here there are three plants A, B and C 
We take the depreciated value
as per the book for A,B,C  the aggregate value is 12,40,000 
During the year same rate of depreciation of 15%
plant H was purchased and car was also purchased
at the same rate of depreciation 
, car also falls under the group block plant 
, total purchase is 2,74,000 
, when we add 2,74,000 with 12,40,000
, if we see the table
we get 15,14,000  
Then the sale consideration  let's see in 15% block
or which are the assets which are being sold,
we had plant A, plan B ,Plan C
plant H and the car in this particular block
out of this we have seen Plan B is sold at 25 lakh 
sale consideration of plant B
and it is sold at 25,10,900 
,sale proceeds of Plant B is more than that of the
calculated value, which we have 15,14,000 and that's why
there is a group of plant A, B and C
the amount deducted will be restricted to 15,14,000 
It cannot be more than that  ,the written down value
of block one will be nil  Same to same in case of block two 
It is plant and machinery with rate of depreciation of 40%
here we get two plants D and E opening balance was 2,60,000  
during the year a cost of computer was purchased on the same
depreciation rate 90,000 and plant B was sold at 12,000 rupees 
, the written down value at the end of the year is
3,38,000 there another plant of machinery
with 30% rate of depreciation 
which falls under same rate of depreciation ,15%
, you get the total value of the block
on the plant A was there it is 70,000 
With this we add the cost of Plan G have been the same rate of depreciation 6000 
, written down value at the end 76,000  there was no sale
from this particular block  Block-4 building with depreciated value,
We have four buildings here A B, C and D
with 10,90,600, and actually there are no addition
or no selling also   10,90,600 is the written down value 
block five are building with rate of depreciation of 5% 
, here we got 7,10,000 as the depreciated value
and the total depreciated value on April 1 2017
There are various admissible deductions we can continue with this,
Weighted deduction in respect of expenditure incurred on
notified agricultural extension project,
weighted deduction in respect of expenditure incurred by companies
on notified skill development project  then amortisation of
preliminary expenses under Section 35 D,
amortisation expenditure incurred under voluntary retirement scheme 
And also, section 36 has other deductions which include insurance premium
insurance premiums paid by the employer on health insurance of employees,
bonus and commission, interest on borrowed capital,
discount on zero coupon bonds etc 
that is expenditure on scientific research
The other deduction list is also long enough
it's contribution to the provident fund and other funds,
employer's contribution to on account of employee under pension scheme
allowances for animal or Bad debts, then expenses on family planning etc 
The list is long enough under this section 
Then section 37 deals with all or Residuary expenses 
If the assessee can prove that any expenses is incurred
for the business or for the furtherance of business
in that case he can claim deduction under Section 37 
under Section 35 and we can see the explanations under Section 35
, the Companies Act 2013 has made it compulsory for spending of CSR
by certain categories of companies 
, section explanation 2 to Section 37(1)
discusses about allowances and dis-allowances of expenditures on CSR 
Section 40 of the Income Tax Act deals with
inadmissible deductions, certain payments or certain expenses are not deductible
in certain circumstances under Section 40A
like payment to relatives or associates,
cash payment in excess of rupees 10,000,
Which is Nowadays is discouraged very much,
of the expenditure which is incurred for scientific research
disallowance of provision for gratuity,
contribution by employers to funds, trust etc  under Section 40 A 
Then profits chargeable to tax under Section 41 
It includes remission or cessation of trading liability,
balancing charge, sale of capital asset used for scientific research,
recovery of bad debt, etc  Withdrawal from reserves created,
brought forward loss etc  Another important aspect
in this particular chapter is for compulsory maintenance of accounts,
which is elaborately discussed under Section 44  AA,
of the Act that maintenance of books of accounts and other documents
and which goes as high as 150% of the expenses,
by notified professionals, maintenance of
books of accounts and other documents if the income
turnover income or turnover or gross receipts exceeds the prescribed limit 
In that case, the assessee is under compulsion
for maintenance of books of accounts  And the audit of
books of accounts of certain persons are also compulsory under Section 44 AB 
, it is obligatory on for a person or carrying on business or profession
to get his accounts audited before the specified date
by a chartered accountant if the total sales turnover
or gross receipts of the business exceeds rupees one crore
which are incurred on scientific research 
or hundred lakhs in any previous year for a business
and in case of a profession, the gross receipts exceeds rupees 50 lakhs 
Section 44 AD makes provision for
computing of profits and gains of business or profession
on presumptive basis for small businesses 
The presumptive taxation under Section 44 AD
covers all small business with total turnover gross receipts
up to rupees 200 lakhs that is rupees two crore
except the business of plying, hiring or leasing goods carriages,
covered under Section 44 AE, but for all other
Music
businesses small businesses up to rupees two crore turnover
they can take advantage of presumptive tax under Section 44 AD
and the payment of tax is very simple, the presumptive rate of
tax is 8% of the total turnover or gross receipts 
, we can see the proforma for computation of profits and gains
of business or profession  The base is the profits,
net profit as calculated under the profit and loss account 
Which is normally prepared by any business house 
We this we will add expenses which are debited to profit and loss account,
but which are not allowable under the Income Tax Act 
Continue with this admissible deduction from section 32 to 37 
, there are various expenses including
the depreciation which a company charges
because depreciation is calculated under Section 32 of the Income Tax Act 
, the expenses which are shown in the profit and loss account 
which are not allowable are added back
same way the expenditures which are allowable as reduction,
but not debited to profit and loss account is also deducted 
Which includes again the depreciation which is
calculated as per provisions same to same with some investment allowable etc 
Then we will also deduct any income
There is investment linked tax incentives under Section 35AD
which is credited to profit and loss account, but not taxable
under any other head  Those expenses are also deducted
and in case of any deemed income, those incomes are added back 
when we do all these four adjustments, ultimately we get
the profit and gains of business and profession 
contribution for Rural Development 35CCA,
Let us see a comprehensive problem 
where the amount of depreciation allowable is 37,300
and it includes depreciation on permanent sign board 
There are certain other information that advertisement expenditure includes
rupees 3000 being cost of permanent sign board,
income of 4500 accrued during the previous year
is not recorded in the profit and loss account 
Mr  A  pays rupees 6000 as premium on life insurance policy 
General expenses include rupees 500 given to Mr  A
for arranging a party in honor of a friend who has recently come from
Germany  rupees 1000 being contribution to political party 
That is how to calculate profits and gains of business or profession
Loan was taken from Mrs  A for payment of arrears of income tax 
, these are some of the information which are given and from there,
it is interesting to calculate
the profits and gains from business and profession 
Let's see the solution, how do we do
our base is net profit as per our profit and loss account,
which shows 2,50,000 
, the expenses which are shown here
in the profit and loss account, some of the expenses
will not be allowed that would be added back to this profit 
from the profit and loss account of an entrepreneur 
, let us see the adjustments the add back of
those items  number one, expenses for arranging personal property not allowed,
contribution to political party not allowed at this moment,
but they can also take advantage from other sections
Advanced tax, it will be deducted from tax payable afterwards
salary to Mr A interest on capital to Mr A,
interest on loan taken for payment of interest,
capital expenditure on advertisement 
Then there is excess depreciation,There are two ways depreciation could have been
added back and then the income tax
The profit and loss account of Mr  A for the year ending March 31 2018 
allowed depreciation could have been deducted or otherwise
we are doing it as excess depreciation there is 48,000 minus 37,300
10,700 we are adding back  
income not recorded in the profit and loss on 4500 
, from here we will deduct
some of the incomes which were shown
in the profit and loss account, but it should not come under the head,
business and profession , this would be deducted
interest on debenture and interest on company deposits 
, when we deduct it we get
From this, we're to ascertain the total income
the income for business and profession as 3,50,300 
We can also compute the net income of Mr A 
as profits and gains of business and profits we are getting
3,50,300  income from other sources
which includes interest on debenture, and company deposit 38,000 
,gross total income is 3,88,300 is an individual 
, he will claim deduction under Section 80 C
like payment of insurance 6000  payment of at 80GGC,
where he has made a contribution to political party of 1000 
he can deduct this and his net
and tax liability for the assessment year 2018-19 
income we can calculate at 3,81,300 
The profit and loss account is shown
, the profit and loss account shows the net profit of 2,50,600 
And there are certain other information,
Hello learners,
, these are the five cases which we have seen 
, let's see question number three 
Mr  P shared the following information
number 1 car acquired by him in March 2011 for Rs  1,00,000
was sold on fifth December 2018 for Rs  45,000 
Written down value of the block on 1 4 2018 was Rs  25,000 
, here the important term which you have to see is written down value
that means car is the depreciable asset 
Ornaments costing Rs  1,50,000 which was acquired
in August 2015 was sold for Rs  2,00,000 in October 2018 was
in the hands of Mr  Sharma?
purchased in 2015 
Self cultivated land in an urban area
was sold for Rs  15,00,000 on 4 1 2019
and its cost in 2002-03 was Rs  2,60,000 
He purchased a new piece of land for his own cultivation
for Rs  3,50,000 in June 2019 
, he has immediately he purchased
a new piece of land   This is also important for us 
House at Mumbai let out for residential purpose 
It was inherited by him in 1964: Sale Price is 22,70,000 
the question see a piece of land
Fair market value on 1 4 2001 is six lakhs 
Cost of improvement made during 2009-10 Rs  1,50,000 
Expenses of transfer Rs  25,000
this is one comprehensive example 
House hold furnitures costing Rs  40,000 in 2002 was sold
in March 2019 for Rs  50,000 
, from the above particulars,
we have to compute his total capital gain assuming that he has
no other income other than the mentioned above 
let's see one by one :car
then that date is also important May 2004,
As you know it is a depreciable asset,
even though it is held for more than 36 months,
but it is always will be short term capital gains 
45,000 minus 25,000 is 20,000 
Ornaments two lakh, it is also short term capital asset
less cost 1,50,000 so 50,000 is the benefit 
, 70,000 is the total short term capital gain 
Let's see long term capital gain,residential house 22,70,000
as it is held for more than 36 months
, it will be qualify for indexed cost of acquisition,
which is sold for 95,000
cost of acquisition was 6,00,000 into 280 the
current CII divided by 100 the CII of 2001-02 that is 100 
16,80,000 is the inflated cost of cost 
Cost of improvement same case 280 divided by the year in which the
improvement took place that year CII 148 
, 1,50,000 into 280 divided by 148 is 2,83,784
transfer expenses is 25,000 
, total is 19,88,784 when you deduct it from the sales
consideration 2,81,216 is the long term capital asset,
long term capital gain 
and this land which is purchased at Rs  95,000 in May 2004
Next comes so we have got the total and this is the
long term capital gain 2,81,000 sale consideration for
self cultivated land is also taxable 15 lakhs
indexed cost of acquisition as it qualifies for long term
capital as 280 divided by 105 6,93,334 
, capital gain is 8,06,666 
But here he can claim exemption under section 54B
as he has immediately purchased another land
, 3,50,000 is deductible so, the balance 4,56,666 is taxable 
, total long term capital gain is 7,37,882 and when we add up
and he sold in April 2017 for rupees 11,50,000 
with the 70,000  So total capital gain is 8,07,882 
, this is a comprehensive problem gives you an idea,
household furniture is not a capital asset,
hence its gain or loss is not taxable 
And section 54B, where the assessee claims
and income deduction of 3,50,000
includes the amount invested in new agricultural land 
, this idea gives you a fairly comprehensive view
of the capital gains taxation 
Next, see Question number four R shares
he sold in 2017, which he was purchased in 2004 
the following information for the previous year ending on
March 31 2018 
, he has got 1,2,3,4,5 kinds of assets 
shares, date of sale is 10th April 2017
for Rs  4,50,000, which he acquired
for Rs  1,70,000 in 2003-04 and the fair market
value on 1st April 2018 is 1,60,000 
Agricultural land in rural area
outside municipal Taxes specifically mentioned 
, it was sold in 25th of may 2017 for Rs  25 lakhs cost is 2,50,000
, he held the asset for more than 36 months or 3 years 
year of purchases 83-84 
Agricultural land in urban area
10th June 2017 he sold for 71 lakhs
was purchased for seven lakhs in the year 2006-07,
fair market value on 1 4 2018 is 3,60,000 
Debentures is sold on 10th April 2017
for rupees five lakhs, which was purchased for Rs  2,50,000
in 2003-04 and the fair market value was Rs  two lakhs 
Personal car which is sold on first July 2017 for rupees one lakh
at a cost of Rs  60,000 in the year 2007-08 
, it qualifies for long term capital gain 
1,2,3,4,5 let's see the taxable calculations where
before that let's there is an information that on July 31,2018
due date for furnishing return of income
are deposits Rs  30 lakhs under section 54B for claiming
exemption in future for purchasing agricultural land 
As you know that there is a capital gains deposit scheme 
, he deposited Rs  30 lakhs by withdrawing from the deposit
account he purchased agricultural land for Rs 27 lakhs
till June 9 2019 assuming that the income of R
from other sources
, let's see how the TAX is being charged?
let's discuss some problems of capital gains 
during the previous year 2017, 18, 19, 20  are Rs  95,000 and
1,80,000 respectively, where to find out the taxable
income of R further assessment year 2018-19 and 2020-21 
Crux of the problem is that he deposited Rs  30 lakhs
in the capital gains gains investment scheme,
but ultimately he utilized 27 lakhs 
And the issue is that if the full amount is not utilized the
balance amount is taxable 
, let's see the solution how it is being shown here 
, 1,2,3,4,5 we can show it in this column ways 
full value of consideration is 11,50,000,
Shares sale consideration is 4,50,000 ,indexed cost of
the acquisition it is held for more than 1 year
He qualifies for indexed cost of acquisition is 4,24,220
capital gains is 27,780 and there is no exemption 
, the balance 27,780 is taxable 
Rural agricultural land is not taxable, it is free,
it is not a capital asset at all 
, sale consideration is not taxable 
Urban agricultural land is of course, taxable from 71 lakh we deduct the
indexed cost of acquisition of 15,60,656 
but the expenditure incurred in connection with
, capital gain is 55,39,344
and never mind it he has deposited 30 lakhs in the
capital gains the deposit scheme 
, he can claim exemption under section 54 B
, the balance amount is taxable for the assessment year 1920 18,19 
Debentures he sold it for five lakhs
indexed cost of acquisition is 2,50,000 
, it is 2,50,000 is the capital gain
, balance 2,50,000 is taxable 
Personnel car is personnel asset it is not taxable
transport of capital asset is 10,000 
as it is not capital asset 
, let's see the computation of total income,
total income from capital head is 28,17,124
income from other sources is 95,000, gross total income is 29,12,124,
there is no deduction 
, taxable income for the assessment year 18-19 is 29,12,124 
, what happened the amount 30 lakhs which was deposited and which
was claimed as exemption in earlier years, ultimately he
utilize 27 lakhs 
, balance three lakhs is taxable in the later assessment year
, net sale consideration is 11,40,000 
with any other income 
, in the year assessment year 2021
these three lakh rupees will be taxable and
in that year the total net income for taxability is 4,80,000 
, these are the four problems and solutions
which we showed to you and hope that this gives you a
comprehensive idea of capital gains taxation 
Thank you very much 
, as it is a long term capital asset,
, we will calculate the indexed cost of acquisition 
How the indexed cost of acquisition is calculated?
the cost of CII on the year of purchase 113
while in 2017 it is 272 
272 divided by 113 into the cost of acquisition 95,000
And we hope that with this discussion, the concept of capital gain
it comes to 2,28,672 or Rs  673 and which is shown here 
, this is the indexed cost of acquisition 
, when we deduct the indexed cost of
acquisition from net sale consideration, we get long term
capital gain as 911,327  ,i am repeating
full value of consideration less any expenditure incurred on the
transfer of the asset here in this case 10,000 rupees was spent 
, net sell consideration is 11,40,000
we have calculated the indexed cost of acquisition
which is 95,000 into 272 divided by 113 and it comes to 228,673 
will be more clearer to you 
indexed cost of improvement is not there  it is Nil so long term
capital gains taxable is 9,11,327 rupees 
, this is problem number one at your solution 
let's see another problem 
M furnishes the following information about his
incomes during the previous year 2018-19:
Capital gain Rs  20,000 from a house
which he occupied for 1 year
before the date of sale on 30 6 2018 
Secondly, on 31st January 2018,
Let's discuss problem number one 
he sold equity shares of XYZ limited for Rs  2,20,000
through a recognized stock exchange, which were
purchased by him on 1 4 2002 and he sold it at 31 1 2018 
Securities transaction tax paid Rs  125 
Fair market value of the shares on 31 1 2018 was Rs  1,80,000 
Thirdly, he sold an agricultural land for Rs  6,50,000 on 30th april 2018 
The land was owned by him
since fourth July 2001 and was purchased for Rs 6000 
The land is situated with a population of 8,500 this is important for us 
The land is situated in a village with a population of
A piece of land was bought by Mr  Sharma in May, 2004
less than 10,000 that is 8500 
Next on 28 2 2019 he sold a flat for Rs  12,00,000
which was purchased by him on 1 1 1977 for Rs  50,000 
The fair market value of the flat was 4,20,000 on 1 4 2001 
He purchased in 1977 sold in 2018
for more than three years obviously 
, M is a resident of India 
Compute his taxable income from capital gains
for the assessment year 2018-19 
we have 1,2,3,4 cases,
for rupees 95,000 and the same was sold in April 2017
Let's see capital gain on sale of house,
the first house which is occupied for 1 year,
, it is a short term capital asset 
, straightaway short term capital gain is 2,20,000 
shares 2,20,000 cost of acquisition is 1,80,000
long term capital gain is 40,000 
But this game is exempted under Section 10(38) 
sale of equity shares 
Capital gain on sale of flat sale consideration is 12,00,000
indexed cost of acquisition is 11,76,000 
for Rs  11,50,00 
We have calculated the indexed cost of acquisition of 11,76,000 
in this way 4,20,000 into 280 by 100 it becomes 11,76,000 
, this way it is being calculated
, long term capital gain is 24,000 
, if we calculate that is the short term capital gain
and this is the long term capital again this is not taxable 
, total income taxable income from capital gain is 44,000 
, out of the five assets, if we see
the cost of acquisition in first case, we have seen that in this
case that is 1,80,000 this 1,80,000 has come
Where he has paid a brokerage rupees 10,000 
from this calculation which we have shown in the note 2 that
cost of acquisition is ,it will be higher of cost of share
60,000 was the cost of acquisition and lower of fair
market value on 31 1 2018 of 1,80,000 and sale price 2,20,000,
whichever is lower, of this lower is 1,80,000
and cost is 60,000 higher of these two
it is 1,80,000 is the cost of acquisition 
Secondly the rural agricultural land which is situated in the village
is not a capital asset and there will be no capital gain
on transfer of such agriculatural land 
The question is what will be the taxable capital gain
Welcome Friends,
Let us make it clear that there is no relationship between the term
citizenship and residential status 
An Indian citizen may be a non resident, whereas a foreigner
may be a resident in India
it depends on the rules for residential status 
Secondly for different kinds of persons
the residential status may be different 
The rules for individuals and HUF,
the rules are different from the rules for companies and other persons 
that's why we learnt that what are the residential status rules
Welcome to week two day one session 
for different kinds of persons 
Another interesting fact is that the residential status may be
different in different assessment year 
An individual may be a non resident in 2016-17 assessment year,
whereas he may be resident in assessment year 2017-18 
, there is no rule that a person
should be of the same residential status over the years 
Another interesting fact is that a resident in india
may be resident in India as well as he may be a citizen or resident
in abroad also 
Today we'll be learning the residential status and tax incidence 
, you only see what are the rules for residential status
and accordingly the determination of residential status will be there 
Section 6 of the Income Tax Act
defines the residential status 
We will now learn what are the rules for residential status 
There are basic conditions: Basic conditions are defined
under section 6(1) of the Act 
There are two basic conditions that a person or a individual
these are the rules for individual and HUF 
, he/she should be in India for a period of 182 days or more
Income Tax Act 1961 <lp  says that the tax incidence or the tax burden
during the previous year 
The second condition is that he should be in India
for a period of 60 days or more
and 365 days or more during 4 years preceding the previous year 
, let me go back to again these two basic conditions 
if an individual is in India for a
period of 182 days or more during the previous year he/she
will be resident in India  Or if the stay is less than 182 days 
Then we have to see the condition number two,
whether he stay or her stay during the previous year is 60 days or more 
falls on a assessee on the basis of his or her residential status
And we will also calculate his or her stay
during the four years preceding the previous year,
which should be more than 365 days 
If an individual satisfies any one of these two conditions,
he or she will be treated as resident in India 
But if an individual cannot satisfy in any of these two conditions,
two basic conditions, then his status will be non resident in India 
There are two exceptions of this rule
an Indian citizen, who leaves India
as a member of a crew of an Indian ship
during the previous year 
for the purpose of employment outside
Or an Indian citizen or person of Indian origin
engaged outside India in an employment or a business
or profession then condition number two, that is 60 days plus 365 days
during the four years will not apply 
, if their stay in India is not more than 182 days they will
be treated as non resident in India 
A resident individual, maybe
an ordinary resident or not ordinary resident 
For this purpose, we have to see the additional conditions,
this session will completely devote to learn
which is given under Section 6 (6) of the Act 
These additional conditions are number one,
he is in India for a period of 730 days
or more during the 7 years preceding the previous year 
Condition number two, he or she is a resident in India
for at least two years out of 10 years preceding the previous year 
If an individual satisfies both the additional condition
then he or she will be treated as a resident and
ordinarily resident in India 
how the resendential status is determined ?
And how tax incidence falls
on an assessee on the basis of his or her resedential status ?
Hello learners,
And the income tax department now is efficient enough
to refund that amount if more amount of TDS is there 
don't worry about the TDS at all  in case of TDS you
will get an entry at your 26 AS a form and from there you can
link it to your income tax return 
if more TDS is there, you will get the refund at once 
Deposits reporting of fixed
deposits or recurring deposits in your tax return 
I may suggest that as a good citizen, you must report the earnings
from fixed deposits and recurring deposits in your tax return regularly  
can advise others 
Even if there is no TDS from the side of the banker 
Let's see the family pension 
Family pension ,that is,
if one is collecting pension on behalf of someone who is diseased,
then you must show this income under the income from other sources 
There is a deduction of Rs  15,000
or one third of the family pension received,
which is lower from the filing a pension income 
This is added to the taxpayer's income and tax must be paid
at the tax rate that is applicable 
that the whole compliance of tax can be made accurately 
There is the winnings from lottery, game shows, puzzles
which come as you know windfall received 
if one receives money from winning from lottery 
Online TV shows etc 
it will be taxable under the head income from other sources 
The income will be taxable at the flat rate of 30%
And you know after adding cess it will become 31 2% 
, these are some of the issues I thought that let me
discuss with you before we close the discussions on
income from other sources 
Let's see the facts one by one 
Thank you 
First one is the savings bank account it's interest income 
If someone has observed that these sections
like section 15, section 16, section 17 deals with income from salary 
And then from section 22
it is income from house property
that is the second type of income
in between some sections are missing 
Let's discuss some interesting facts
Actually these sections are there when we had six sets of income,
interest on securities was the second head of income 
But with the rationalization of income tax,
this head of income had been abolished and now we
have only five heads of income  And that's why interest income
comes under income from other sources 
Regarding savings bank account we have to say that
interest that gets accumulated in your savings bank account
must be declared in your tax return
under income from other sources 
from the chapter income from other sources 
But note that bank does not deduct TDS on Savings Bank interest 
it is up to the taxpayer up to the assessee to show it
in the income tax return 
Interest from both fixed deposits and recurring deposits
is taxable while interest from savings bank account
and post office deposits are tax deductible to certain extent 
But all of these are shown in the income tax return
under the head income from other sources 
Interest income from a savings bank account
or a fixed deposit or from a post office savings bank account
Income from other sources is the last head of income
are all shown under the head interest
income under the head income from other sources 
let's see the deductions on interest income under Section 80 TTA 
Make it clear that for a resident individual age of 60 years or
less or HUF, interest earned up to Rs  10,000 in a
financial year is exempt from tax 
The deduction is allowed on interest income earned from make it clear
savings account with a bank 
savings account with a cooperative society
carrying on business or banking
and it encompasses all incomes which cannot be accommodated
and savings account with a post office 
Remember section 80 TTA the deduction up to Rs  10,000
is not applicable to senior citizens 
Senior citizens are not entitled to benefit
under Section 80TTA  for them there
is another section 80 TTB which I'll be discussing just next 
Let's say tax on fixed deposits 
Fixed deposits interest that one receives is added along with
other income that he or she has such as salary or professional income
and he or she has to pay tax on that income at the tax rate
in any other heads like income from salary,
that is applicable to him or her 
TDS is deducted on interest income when it is earned,
though it may not have been paid 
Bank will deduct TDS on interest accrued each year
on an FD of say five years  Therefore, it is advisable to
pay taxes on an annual basis instead of doing it
only when the FD matures 
Then they advise that income tax should be paid
on an annual basis rather than you wait for the FD to
mature at the end and then we will pay tax 
income from house property, business and profession capital gains 
Let's see about a senior citizen section 80 TTB 
Senior citizens with effect from 1st April 2018,
will enjoy an income tax exemption up to rupees 50,000
on the interest income they received from fixed deposits with banks,
post offices etc  under Section 80 TTB 
mind it 80TTB is exclusively for senior citizens
and it is on interest on fixed deposits with banks or post offices
and the deduction is as high as rupees 50,000 
, please advise senior members of this particular section 80 TTB 
Regarding TDS on fixed deposits, banks are required to deduct tax
it gives a wide spectrum of income,
when income from deposits held in all bank branches put together
is more than rupees 40,000 in a year  40,000 has
been made this year's budget  Prior to financial year 2019-20,
it was rupees 10,000 
from this year onwards, it was 40,000
and banks will deduct income tax from the interest on fixed deposit 
A 10% TDS is deducted if bank details are available 
If PAN details are not available then 20% will be deducted 
See those people those persons who earn less than
the exemption limit, they can avoid the TDS and by submitting
which are included under the set, but there are certain specific issues
the form 15 G and 15 H to the bank and requesting them not to deduct TDS 
But remember the people who are liable to pay tax
that is whose income is more than the exemption limit
should not submit 15 G or 15 H even if it is insisted by the bank,
Please 15H is for senior citizens, that is 60 years or older
and 15 G for everybody else 
One thing to remember that TDS is not
at all the tax which is done as a payment 
TDS is only an advanced things 
If your actual tax is less, you can very well show it in the return 
where the learners can take note of these things as well as
Hello, welcome learners
cash transaction the government has imposed
2% TDS for withdrawing cash from bank accounts 
Another important thing which is there is that ITR filing is made
mandatory in certain cases 
As per the current laws, a person is required to file ITR
if his or her total income exceeds maximum income not
chargeable to tax subject to certain exceptions like at this
moment 2,50,000 it becomes a limit 
But, even if a person does not reach that amount of income,
but if the amount deposited in current account held with bank or
more than Rs  5 crore have to pay a higher amount of surcharge 
Cooperative Bank exceeds Rs  1 crore in any financial year,
expenditure incurred on foreign travel
exceeds Rs  12 lakh in a financial year 
If an individual incurred an electricity bill
of Rs  1 lakh or more in a year Claiming capital gains
exemption on investment on house 
In that case even if their income does not reach the exemption limit 
Even then, this person's will be required to file
mandatorily the income tax return 
this is the new insertion
But for the lower level of income earners
parking and other charges come under the ambit of TDS
with effect from September 1, 2019,
any payment made towards buying of property including payments
made with respect to amenities such as club membership fees,
car parking fees, electricity and water maintenance fees etc 
We ascertained the amount of TDS to be deducted while making the payment 
Currently, tax is deducted only for the payment made
with respect to property and other payments made for
services are not included 
this is a particular step towards making Tax Compliance more wider 
individual whose taxable income
As well as TDS on payments exceeding Rs  50 lakh to contractors
that is individuals and Hindu undivided families
with effect from 1st, September 2019,
will have to deduct tax at the rate of 5%
for payments made to contractors and other professionals
if it exceeds Rs  50 lakhs in a year 
Presently, individuals and HUFs
are not required to deduct tax
at source on payments made to contractor and professionals 
NRIS to pay tax on gifts received by resident Indians 
does not exceed Rs  5 lakhs will continue to
As per our budget proposals, gift received by non-resident Indians
that is NRIs from someone residing in India will come
under the tax ambit 
As per budget documents, this will apply
for the money paid or property situated in India transferred
on or after July 5, 2019 
to give relief to the salaried class, in my first
week classes I have shown some data which was presented by
the finance minister Arun Jaitley who says that 76 lakhs
people only show income tax return that is their earning
avail the tax-rebate and thereby will pay zero tax 
more than rupees five lakhs,which is unbelievable 
And irony is that out of 76 lakhs 56 lakhs are salaried employees 
, it is a fact that majority of the income tax
has been collected from the salaried employees
because their incomes are transparent 
, salaried employees need to be given some kind of relief 
, standard deduction was introduced two years back,
it was rupees 40,000 
And now these budget has increased
the deduction of salary from rupees 40,000 to rupees 50,000
I think it will be clear if I show you a table 
for the next financial year 
No tax or notional rent there is another good news that is if a person
owns two houses, which are under residential accommodation of self,
earlier only one house was taken as
self occupied and the gross annual value was taken as nil 
Other house was taken as a deemed to be let out
and notional rent was to be charged as tax 
This year budget proposes that he will not
be required to pay tax or notional rent or deemed rent on
your second house if it is lying vacant 
This table shows that income up to Rs  2 5 lakhs
, a person can show gross annual value nil
into self occupied properties instead of one as earlier 
I have already discussed it in the capital gains chapter
But even then to repeat that, if you sold a house,
and then to save tax you can invest in long term capital gain
and this year it is allowed in two houses instead of one earlier 
However, this can be availed if capital gains
do not exceed Rs  2 crore and it is once in a lifetime of an individual 
, these are some of the benefits which are given
or in the newly placed budget by the union finance minister
tax rate is nil there is no surcharge there is no cess 
Ms  Nirmala sitharaman 
And will be applicable for the next assessment year 
, I thought learners should know these things
before we close our discussions on incomes
from different heads 
Thank you 
From 2,50,001 to Rs  5,00,000 the tax rate is 5%
and there is no surcharge though there is the cess
and at the end of discussion on income from other sources,
education cess is 4%
but a rebate up to Rs  12,50,000 is available for those
whose net taxable income does not exceed Rs  5,00,000 
That means any person earning income up to Rs five lakhs
need not paid any amount of tax because the tax
rebate amount is increased 
But if a person earns more than rupees five lakhs,
then this tax slab will be applicable 
in that case that person has to pay 5% tax on
this slab 2,50,001 to rupees five lakhs  , this is the difference  ,
I thought that let me discuss some issues
we cannot straight away say that the exemption limit is
rupees five lakhs  no, any person earning income up to Rs  five lakhs
need not pay tax but exemption limit is rupees 2,50,000 
, as it is a progressive rate of taxation
the tax rate increases from 5% 
Next is 20% there is no 10% slab, next is 30% which is the maximum 
, if a person earns up to rupees 50 lakhs the tax
rate will be 30% for the amount
exceeding rupees ten lakhs and there is no surcharge 
But, if the income is more than rupees 50 lakhs
which have come in budget 2019 
then the surcharge comes 10% and the surcharge gradually
increases to 15%, 25%, 37% that is more than rupees five crore,
the surcharge will be 37% of the tax 
, but in all the cases the cess is 4% 
What happens if we see that, due to this increased
introduced surcharge, those with incomes between Rs 2 crores
and 5 crores will effectively have to pay 39% as tax
and those with income more than Rs  5 crore
will have to pay 42% of tax 
thus the tax burden on Super rich is made a bit higher 
, that you were updated about the changes that have been
to say that there are certain other changes
which are being brought in, we can say that NPS withdrawl, NPS is
the National Pension System, it becomes tax free 
That is those investing in the National Pension System have another
reason to cheer in this year's budget 2009 and it has finally
announced the move to make lump sum withdrawals at the time of
maturity as tax exempt 
NPS at the time of maturity, allows the
investor to withdraw 60% of the corpus as lump sum and the
remaining 40% to be used as compulsorily buy annuity plan 
brought by budget 2019 
Those learners who want to know more about the NPS can read 
As per current law 40% of the lump sum withdrawal is tax-exempt
from the 60% corpus 
And also the contribution to the NPS
comes under the deductions under Section 80 C 
We can see the other changes that additional tax break for
buying an affordable house 
As announced in budget 2019, an individual can
claim an additional deduction of 1 5 lakhs on interest paid on
home loan under the newly introduced section 80EEA,
The first one that is important to discuss is that
this is a newly introduction section, but there are certain conditions 
The conditions are that the loan must be taken
between April 1, 2019 and march 31, 2020 
learners you can help others to suggest that
if a housing loan is taken between
April 1, 2019 to march 31 2020  The value of the property must
not exceed Rs  45 lakhs individual should not own any
house on the date of sanctioning of the loan
these are the three term conditions of course 
In that case section 80EEA gives that
there is no change in the income tax slabs 
additional deduction of Rs  1 5 lakhs is available over and
above existing Rs  2 lakh deduction on the home loan
interest paid under Section 24  That means, if a person does not
own a residential house and wishes to buy a house and if
he or she can take a loan during the period April 1, 2019 to march 31 2020
for a house property of Rs  45 lakhs
in that case he or she can claim a total deduction of 3 5 lakhs
of interest payment on loan under Section 24 that is income from
House property the deduction is 2 lakhs and additionally under
Section 18 specifically 80EEA,
However, there is a tax on super-rich that is those earning
additional deduction of Rs  1 5 lakhs is possible 
, this is the changes that has been brought 
another thing to discourage cash transactions and
to push digital payments, budget 2019 has proposed to impose
tax deduction at source at the rate of 2% if the total cash
withdrawn in a financial year exceed Rs  1 crore from a bank
or post office or a cooperative bank from a single account 
However, this proposal will come into effect from
September 1, 2019 and this is only a TDS 
And this is not a tax just to crack the
more than Rs  2 crores but less than Rs  5 crore and those earning
Let us have one example on residential status 
If the HUF is resident, then the status of the Karta
determines whether it is resident and ordinary resident or resident
but not ordinarily resident 
If the Karta is resident and ordinary resident,
then the HUF is resident and ordinary resident 
If the Karta is resident but not ordinary resident, then the
HUF is resident but not ordinary resident in India 
The Karta must satisfy both the additional conditions as
specified under Section 6(6) for resident and ordinary resident 
The relevant assessment year is 2019-20 
, the previous year will be just before that 2018-19 
We are to calculate the stay of Malcom Marshall
during the previous year that is 2018-19
and which is given the question as 87 days 
, thus he is not satisfying basic condition number one
that is the stay of 182 days 
But as his stay is more than 60 days
and he is not an Indian citizen, neither a person of Indian origin,
as such we have to calculate his stay during 4 years
Malcolm Marshall is a foreign citizen,
preceding the previous year 
We say when we add up his stay during 2017-18,
2016-17, 2015-16, 2014-15 that is the
4 years preceding the previous year  we find that
his total stay during the year is 651 days 
Thus he satisfies condition number 2 of basic condition
as specified under section 6(1) of the Act 
Thus, Malcom Marshall is resident in India
for the assessment year 2019-20 
A resident individual may be
not being a person of Indian origin 
an ordinary resident or not ordinary resident 
To determine this, we have to find out his stay
during 7 years preceding the previous year and his
residential status during 10 years preceding the previous year 
If we plot the days of stay during 7 years
preceding the previous year, since 2011-12 till 2017-18
the total gives us as stay of 1196 days 
that is his stay during 7 years is 1196 days,
which is more than 730 days
as required under additional condition specified in Section 6(6)
Let us determine his residential status
, as he satisfies 1 condition of the
section 6 (6), we have to see the other condition,
which says about the residential status 
, this chart shows about the residential status 
If we come from backward
that is just preceding the previous year that is 2017 -18 
He is resident in India because he stayed
for a period of 281 days,
that is he satisfies 182 days or more 
And that's why he is resident in India
for the assessment year 2019-20 on the assumption that
In 16-17, he stays 86 days,
thus he is not satisfying condition number one of 182 days,
but we have to see his stay during the four years
preceding the previous year that is his stay during
2015-16, 14-15, 13-14, 12-13  if we add up we see that his stay is
more than 365 days 
And that's why he is satisfying condition number two
during the financial year 16-17 
In such way, we have seen his residential status
for the year 14-15, 13-14, 12-13, 11-12,
during the financial years 2004-05
10-11 in the year 10-11, his stay is only 31 days 
Thus he is not satisfying any of the basic conditions 
, his status will be non resident 
But in 2009-10 and 2008-09, his stay is sufficient
for being a resident in India 
In 2009-10 he is resident in 341 days
, he satisfies condition number one and in 2008-09
though his stay is less than 182 days, but he stayed during the
preceding 4 years that is 2007-08, 6-7 5-6 4-5 exceeds 365 days
, he satisfies condition number two 
to 2018-19, he was present in India
, if we see the table
will find that he is non resident only in one year
that is,he is resident in nine years
out of 10 years preceding the previous year,
where the requirement is only two years out of 10 years
under Section 6(6)  
Thus, he satisfies both the additional conditions
as laid down under section 6(6) And one of the basic conditions
under section 6(1) of the Act 
Thus, the residential status of Malcom Marshall
as shown in the table 
for the assessment year 2019-20
is RESIDENT and ORDINARILY RESIDENT in India 
I think it is a comprehensive example, which gives
a thorough idea about the residential status of an individual 
I am grateful to Dr  Vinod K  singhania and Dr  Kapil Singhania
because the idea of this problem has been taken from their book,
direct taxes law and practice published by taxman's publications 
mind it an individual must satisfy
both the additional conditions 
in other words it means if an individual does not satisfy
any one of the above conditions in that case his status will be
resident but not ordinarily resident in India 
In case of HUF the rule is almost same
but with a big difference 
A HUF will be resident in India if the control and management of
its affairs is situated wholly or partly in India 
An HUF will be non resident if the control and management
of the efforts is situated wholly outside India 
In that case only it will become non resident HUF 
A resident HUF may be ordinary resident or not ordinary resident 
We are to determine the residential status of Mr  Malcolm Marshall 
Residential status of companies  Let us discuss how the
it is not taxable for resident,
but not ordinarily resident and non resident 
Gift received outside India by an individual from a friend 
It is also taxable for resident an ordinarily resident,
but not taxable for not ordinarily resident and non resident 
Gift received at Delhi by an individual from a friend
as it is received in India in that case, it is taxable for
resident and ordinarily resident, resident but not ordinarily resident,
as well as non resident 
Last example I may take that income earned
are known as foreign companies 
and received outside India in the past and later on
remitted to India during the previous year 
So, the income was earned during the past years
and probably the tax might have been paid on that 
And now that income is remitted to India,
this is a good case of remitting of foreign exchange to
India which we need in that case, it is no no no, that is
does not taxable, neither for resident and ordinary resident,
resident but not ordinarily resident as well as non resident 
We may end this discussion with some tax planning tips 
And Indian company is always resident in India 
One may be that an Indian citizen
or a person of Indian origin,
he or she wants to come to India and stay
for more than 181 days,
without losing his or her status of non resident  Is it possible
because section basic conditions given under Section 6(1)
says the number one condition that if
an individual stays in India for a period of 182 days,
in that case he or she will becomes resident in India 
So, if a person wants to stay for more than 182 days
But In case of a foreign company, the rule is a different 
in a year, is it possible?
Yes, it may be possible if he or she plans the visit in such a way
that it falls in two previous years 
In one previous year, it is not more than 181 days 
In this way, we will try to give the tax planning tips
in different discussions and this is the discussions we make on
this residential status and tax incidence 
Thank you 
In case of foreign companies we have to see
the level of turnover  If the annual turnover
of a foreign company is less than 50 crores
in that case, it will always be a non resident company 
<p> But in case of foreign companies whose turnover is more than
50 crores, we are to see a term called POEM
POEM stands for place of effective management 
residential status of companies is determined 
For foreign companies whose turnover in the previous year
is more than 50 crore POEM is important 
POEM is the place of effective management
that means where a place where the management and commercial decisions
that are necessary for the conduct of the business of an entity
as a whole are located 
If the POEM is situated in India,
in that case it will be a resident company
and other case, it will be a non resident company 
Now, let us discuss the relationship between
There are Indian companies as well as there are foreign companies 
residential status and tax incidence  But before that,
let me clear a concept called Indian income and foreign income 
There are some incomes, which are treated as Indian income
and there will be some income which will be treated as foreign income 
Let's see the criteria by which this income
can be categorized as Indian income as well as foreign income 
And Indian income is the income which is received
or deemed to be received in India and accrues and arises
or deemed to accrue or arise in India 
That means any income which is received in India
Indian companies are those which are registered under the Companies Act,
or accrues in India is an Indian income 
Similar way an income which is deemed to be received in India
or deemed to accrue in India is an Indian income 
Secondly, if an income
which is received outside India but accrues or arises
or deemed to accrue or arise in India,
this is also treated as Indian income 
Music
let's see the incidence of tax for different tax payers 
An Indian income is taxable for all categories of persons that means,
1956 and now, it is Companies Act 2013 
it is taxable for resident and already resident
it is taxable for resident but ordinary resident in India and
it is also taxable for non resident 
But a foreign income for resident an ordinary resident,
it is taxable in India,
but for not ordinary resident, it is not taxable in India,
except in two situations, that is if the business income
is controlled from India
or if the profession is set up in India, only these two cases
the foreign income will be taxable in the hands of not ordinarily resident 
So, any company registered under the prevailing Companies Act in India
But in case of non resident a foreign income is not taxable in India 
So, we see that for a non resident,
the incidence of tax is much lower than the resident in India 
So, for tax planning purpose normally a non resident
will not like to lose his or her status as non resident in any
previous year otherwise they will attract more amount of income tax 
We can see some examples, that is how the income is chargeable
to tax for different categories of persons 
Like rental income received in India, but accrues outside India,
but as it is an income received in India, it will be
is a resident company 
taxable for all categories of person that is resident an ordinary resident,
resident but not ordinarily resident as well as non resident 
Second example may be interest income accrued in India
received outside India, but as the income accrues in India,
it is taxable for all categories of persons 
Income deemed to be received in India accrued outside India
as the income is deemed to be received in India 
So, across the residential status,
all the persons will be liable to pay tax in India 
Income deemed to accrue in India but received outside India
And any other company which is not registered
as the income is deemed to be received,
deemed to be accrued in India 
In that case, it is taxable for all categories
of residential status of persons 
Next example may be business income received
and accrued outside India from a business controlled outside India,
that is the business income received and accrued outside India
and from a business control from outside India 
In that case only for resident an ordinary resident
it will be taxable, it will not taxable for resident
under the Companies Act in India,
but not ordinary resident and it is not taxable for non residents 
Another example you may take that
business income received and accrued outside India from a
business control from India as the business is controlled from India,
it is taxable for resident and not ordinarily resident
resident and only resident,
but it is not taxable for foreign non resident 
Rental income received outside India accrued outside India 
This is also a case where received and accrued
both outside India, it is taxable for only resident an ordinary resident,
but are operating in India
Now we'll be discussing something on exempted incomes 
under section 80C, chapter 6A of the income tax act 
Now, in case of exemptions under section 10
that income does not form a part
of the total income of the person  That means, we will not
add that particular income in calculating the total income of
the person 
But in case of deductions at first, the income will be added
to the total income and then separately,
it will be deducted as a deduction, which are given under
chapter 6A of the Income Tax Act 
Income Tax Act 1961 categorically mentions a list of incomes,
So, this is the basic difference between
the terms exemption and deduction 
Let us start with the least of exempted incomes,
that incomes which are not included in the total income,
which is given under Section 10 of the Income Tax Act 
Number one, the place of pride in the list
is taken by agricultural income
under section 10(1) of the Income Tax Act 
Agriculture income as defined under Section 10(1)
includes rent or revenue derived from land situated in India
which are either fully exempted from tax or partially exempted from tax 
and used for agricultural purposes 
And income derived from such land, through agriculture,
through a process ordinarily employed to render the procedure
that would fit to be taken to the market 
And or sale of such agricultural produce in the market 
If a person earns income in this way,
then it will be treated as agricultural income under Section 10(1) 
It will be noted that the aggregate provisions do not apply to
the company, LLP, firm, cooperative society 
What is aggregate provision?
Section 10 of the Income Tax Act describes
That though agriculture income does not form part
of the total income but for calculation of the rate purposes,
it is first added and then the exemptions are given
from the income tax 
We will be discussing this particular issue of
aggregation of agricultural income
at the end of the course, when we'll be
calculating the total income of a person for the purpose of
calculation of income tax 
As I have already told that agricultural income
all these exempted incomes 
is the income which is defined under Section 10(1)
it may include income derived from the sale of seeds 
Income from growing flowers or creepers 
Rent received from land used for grazing of cattle
required for agricultural activities 
Income from growing of bamboo 
So these are all examples of agricultural income 
But I'll also provide some examples of incomes
which cannot be treated as agricultural income 
These are income from breeding of livestock 
Before I discuss the exemption incomes
Income from poultry farming  Income from fisheries 
Income from dairy farming 
So these are not agricultural income
and will not fall under Section 10(1) as the exempted income 
under Section 10
let us clear a concept between two terms exemption versus deduction 
Exemptions are given under Section 10
of the income tax act, while deductions are given
Welcome participants 
in the hands of non residents in India 
This is the summary of the section five of Income Tax Act 
As far as the scope of total income is concerned 
In our next discussions, we will be discussing
the detailed discussion on the residential status of an individual 
Thank you very much 
Number one the residential status of the assessee,
Number two, the place of accrual or receipt of income 
Number three, the point of time
at which the income had accrued to or was received by or on
behalf of the assessee 
I repeat, number one, the residential status of the assessee
that where was the residents of that particular assessee 
We'll discuss detail about the residential status
in our further discussions 
Secondly, the place of accrual or receipt of income where is the place?
Today we'll discuss the scope of total income
Whether it is in India or outside India 
And thirdly, the point of time at
which the income had accrued to or was received by or on behalf
of the assessee 
So the place of accrual of the income is also very important 
On the basis of place
the income will be recognized as Indian income or foreign income 
Now suppose, the income is received or deemed to be received in India
during the relevant previous year
or whether the income accrues
as described under section 5 of the Income Tax Act 1961 
or arises or deemed to accrue or arise in India 
If either of these two happens in India,
it would be an Indian income 
Repeating again, that means, if income in received in India or
deemed to be received in India or if income arises or accrues
in India or deemed to accrue or arise in India, it would be an
Indian income 
If both do not happen, like the income is
not received in India or deemed to be received in India 
The income does not accrue or does not arise in India 
Section five of the Income Tax Act deals with the scope of income 
He both together happen in that case it would be foreign income 
Otherwise, if either of these two is present in that case,
it would be treated as Indian income 
The incidence of tax for different taxpayers,
we say discuss individual and HUF and other taxpayers separately 
For individual and HUF the incidence of tax for different taxpayers
depends on whether it is Indian income or foreign income 
While we will discuss the residential status in detail
in our following discussions,
you will find there are three categories of residents 
It states that scope of total income of a person
One is resident an ordinary resident 
Secondly, resident but not ordinarily resident in India 
And thirdly, non resident 
If it is an Indian Income
it taxable for all three categories of assessees
on the basis of a residency status  That is, if it is an Indian income,
it is taxable in India, whether the person is
resident an ordinarily resident in India,
resident but not ordinarily resident India,
whether it is non resident, it would be taxable in India 
is determined by reference to his residence in India
If it is a foreign income in that case, it will be taxable
if the person is resident and ordinarily resident in India
and it will be not taxable for any non resident 
That means, a foreign income is not taxable in the hands of non resident 
But if a person is a resident but not ordinarily resident in India
only two types of foreign incomes are taxable in India 
Any other foreign income are not taxable in Indian 
Now what are these two types is ?
Number one, business income
if the business is controlled wholly or partly from India,
in the previous year 
and income of profession income of profession
for which is set up in India 
In these two cases, a foreign income is taxable in the hands of
resident but not ordinaarily resident 
Beside these two all other foreign income are not taxable
in the hands of individual or HUF,
who are resident but not ordinary resident 
Now, let's see the incidence of tax for different taxpayers
other than individual and HUF 
If in case of other than individual and HUF,
That means, section 5 always talks about
there is no category call resident and ordinary resident 
So, there are a series of only two categories 
Number one is resident in India and second one is non resident 
And Indian income is taxable for both categories 
A foreign income is taxable in case the person
is resident in India and for non resident a foreign income is not taxable 
Regarding the residential status who are resident or ordinary resident
who are resident but not ordinary resident,
who are non resident we'll discuss in detail
in our next discussions 
the residents of the assessee  The scope of total income of an
In conclusion, we can say that
Indian income is always taxable in India,
irrespective of the residential status of the taxpayer 
Foreign income is taxable in India,
in the hands of resident and ordinary resident 
Resident or ordinarily resident happens in case the
taxpayer is individual an HUF 
And in case other than individual HUF,
it is the residents 
Foreign income are not taxable in India,
assessee depends on three important considerations:
but still I have to file the return  I am under compulsion to
file my return compulsively  Since my basic exemption
I have crossed the basic exemption limit of two lakh fifty thousands 
who is a practicing chartered accountant for last 20 years
and has wide experience in the field 
So today, the entire session we'll be devoting
discussing with CA Rajkumar Nahata on various aspects of
return on of income and assessment 
, may I just start with the discussion
about the process of return of assessment?
, CA Rajkumar Nahata it's over to you do just
introduce the concept to the learners 
Thank you and welcome learners 
Welcome learners  Welcome to week 10 discussions 
, today we are here to
learn something about return of income and assessment 
,how do we inform or how do we
how do we inform our income
or what we have earned to the income tax department in which manner
so we do so by filing our return of income 
, we have to file our return of income
to make aware the department
what we have earned during the year
How we are discharging our tax liability 
Today, we will discuss a very important aspect of income tax 
, all these things we will be learning in this session 
, before starting this as I presume that
all of you might be aware of the
concepts of previous year, assessment year, total income,
gross total income and person assessee
because this all these topics
have already been discussed in your earlier lectures 
, I suppose, all these issues have already been covered 
, the learners can go back and they have a clear concept
about all these things which we have already discussed in week one discussion 
And as a good citizen, every assessee
, CA Nehata we have heard that the assessee must
compulsorily filethe return on income to the income tax authorities 
What is your views on this particular aspect of
compulsory filing of return of income  Yes
As far as company and partnership firms
assessee are concerned each and every company
and partnership firm is required
to compulsorily file their return of income every year 
In case of other assessee, it is not the same 
, for individual HUFs and other assessee,
must submit the return on income on time
it is not compulsory that you have to file a return every year 
, your total income will decide
or your total income will be the criteria
based on which your liability or non liability will be decided 
, if our total income,
see if our total income exceeds rupees two lakh 50,000
which is the maximum amount or which is the basic exemption
limit which has been fixed by the government,
and this keeps on changing from time to time every year the government
keeps on changing the basic exemption limit 
and on the basis of the return of income submitted by the assessee,
So as when our income crosses the basic exemption limit
our liability to file the return of income arises,
and we have to file our return of income every year 
, but in case of companies and partnership firms,
this basic threshold limit is not applicable 
They have to file income tax return,
irrespective of their income  Whatever their income is,
that is not matter, they have to file compulsively every year 
So this is the compulsory filing of return  Yes sir,
It probably does under Section 199  Yes 
the income tax department acessed the tax of that particular assessment 
It is covered by section 139, subsection one 
So regarding individual, all individuals are not able to
file the income tax return  Yes, only if their income crosses of a maximum amount
which is not chargeable to income tax act or we can yes sir,
or we can say, the basic threshold limit which the government is set up 
Then all individuals also must compulsorily file the
return of income under Section 139 subsection one 
But in case of partnership firm and in case of companies
there is no such choices given, they are under compulsion,
that whatever the income may be, they must file
As it is a very practical aspect,
return on income  ,here
I would like to add one thing also  In this year, there is one confusion
which is prevailing among the assessee thatmy basic exemption limit is
has been raised to five lakhs by the government 
, actually this is not the case
they haveprovided for a rebate of tax payable
on income up to rupees five lakhs, but the basic exemption is
still 2,50,000 , whatever tax liability
you have on your income up to rupees five lakhs
that will be allowed as a rebate under Section 87A 
so I thought that let it make be made more practical,
But, basic exemption limit is two fifty thousand still 
, even if my income is five lakh rupees or something
I must submit the income tax and show the income tax rebate separately 
, I did not paid income tax that is separate case
but the return of income must be submitted 
If my income exceeds rupees two lakh fifty thousand,
even if it is less than rupees five lakhs  Yeah
that means we have to differentiate between
total income and tax payable  Your tax payable might be nil  Yes,
Suppose my income is 4,50,000, my tax payable is nil,
and that's why we have invited today, CA Rajkumar Nahata
Now regarding the filing of return is there is any date
this is financial is 2019-20
, for the financial year 2019-20 my due date would be
or due date in case of a the company would be 30th September 2020 
And in case of this what we say in case of those persons who are required to
file a report under Section 92 E, that is in case of international transaction 
,there the government is prescribed the due date as
30th november  Two months more  Yes, and for all other assessee's
other than those which we have covered in above two categories
the due date is 31st July of the next financial year
or you can say 31st July of the assessment year because since we are
or something that is mentioned in the Income-tax Act 1961 
quite aware of financial year and assessment year 
, I would like to add a little more thing
about financial year and previous year 
You'll see we have to whatever we have earned during the financial year 
When will we file the return
only after the end of the financial year we can file our returns 
, the department will be assessing our returns
immediately after the close of the financial year once we have filed returns 
, that is why we say it is assessment year, the year in which the
assessment will be made by the income tax department
Yes, sir  Yes, the section that is section 139(1)
in respect of the income tax return which we have filed 
, this is not explained technically
I have explained it practically, what is assessment year 
Because assessment year in itself it is speaking about itself
that in that year your income will be
assessed by the department in different manners  They have different
provisions or different manners of assessing your income as well 
, this is the due date 
, the normal due date is 31st of July
for all categories  For all categories 
provides for certain due dates as well  , in case of
Okay  Seems like what when the accounts are audited,
yes  30th September Yeah, one more thing  30th September
if a person's accounts are required to be audited
under Section 44AB of the Income Tax Act 
I already discussing business profits  Yes, which has already been discussed in the
business and profession  , if my turnover crosses the certain
specified limit, then my accounts are liable to be
audited under the Income Tax Act or if my accounts are liable to
be audited under any other law, say cooperative societies act;
Companies Act
companies, all the companies except the companies
Then in case in that case also the my due date is
30th September  And if I am a partner,
if I am a working partner of a firm
whose accounts are required to require to be audited under
Section 44AB of the Income Tax Act,
then also my due date would be 30th September 
, 31st July or 30th September the important 
Basically these are the two important due dates 
But in case of international transactions
it can be extended  Yeah, these two dates are more relevant, and
which are claiming, which are registered under Section 25 of Companies Act 
that 30th November is less relevant 
, this is the learning which we have till now that all
good citizens must submit their return on income they must
disclose their income to the income tax authorities
in particular format in a proper manner under Section 139(1)
and also within a specified due date, which is normally
31st of July, but in case the accounts are audited, it can be 30th September 
Yes, nonprofit companies, they are
required to file the return on or before 30th September of every financial year
or the 30th September following the year in which the
following the financial year  Suppose if
, CA Nahata sir,
For them it is not applicable  LLP is a new entry 
Yeah, it is a very new concept and
and it has not gained that momentum also 
It is not that popular also but because partnership firms,
they are very easy to operate and they are very less compliances,
so that's why LLP is still it is not that popular, but ITR 4 sugam 
, if I am reporting my income say this is basically for small
businessman ITR 4  It is for known as sugam, SUGAM yes 
Because if I'm having, I'm a small businessman, so this is only for business only,
ITR 4  ITR4 is it, this form cannot be used by any other
simplifying those forms and these forms have come of a long age 
for any other reporting any other income 
Salaried person No no only for business income 
, there are a few sections which we have
already discussed in business profession 44AA, 44A, 44AD,
44AE, 44AF which which deals with presumptive taxation 
These sections they are dealing with presumptive taxation 
See, I am a small businessman, I'm having a turnover of say one crore or
and below one crore and
it is not practicable for me to keep a accountant and
maintain all those details because, for all those type of
mtaa, there are five six forms
businessman, those who are having turnover below one crore
and to encourage digital transactions, the government has
also introduced or also increase the limit to two crores
for this presumptive taxation 
, if you are doing your transactions digitally or
through banking channels, then this one crore
and if it you can extend it to two crore also 
, if there are you have to report a certain percentage of profit 
, it is 44ADs for civil contractors and other business
those they have to report a certain percentage of profit it is 8% 
which are presently available and
, if you report 8% you can file ITR 4 sugam 
It is simple, and you may don't go in all account and details
You don't have, you simply have to report the income as per the
rates which have been or as per the manner  It is not applicable for big
business houses  No sir it is only applicable for show us
When we goes for eligible for presentive type  Yes sir 44AD,
44AE and 44AFthese three sections they are dealing
basically dealing with presumptive taxation 
, there are 44AD is for all business and 44AE for
trucks those who are applying in the business of applying of trucks 
we have to find out the form correct form in which
44AF, earlier it was there for retail minorities not
anymore or that is being taken care of by 44AD only  44AD
that government has decided or fixed a turnover limit 
The turnover limit is one core  So, all persons
who are having turnover up to five, one crore
and those who are ready to report their income
at the rate which has been prescribed by the government,
which is 8% they can file the return in a very simple manner in ITR 4 SUGAM 
Suppose, if I want, if I say that no
I am not earning income at the rate of 8%,
our returnis, because it is very important that
I am having income of only 2% or 3% or 1% 
, then I will have to select ITR three in that case 
, then I have to show more details Yes, then I have to get myobviously
even I have to get my accounts audited, sir
I have to maintain books and I have to get my accounts audited and
I have to file my return in ITR 3 not ITR 4 
Those assessees who think that okay for simple, terms 8% payment is better
so they will go for ITR 4  For those assessees where books of
maintaining books of accounts is not practicable or where
it is in their line of business it is in various lines of business we
we file our return in the correct form 
don't find practically it is not possible for them to
obtain all vouchers and all bills 
for them basically it is for
contract earlier it was 44AD was only for contractors 
they have changed from contractor, they have eligible business
they have turned it as all eligible business
they can go for 44A  If the
turnover is below one crore and they can go for ITR 4 SUGAM 
, if our form is not correct, our return will be considered as defective
and it will presume that we have never filed them
as if we have never filed return 
Annoying the particular form is very important  Sir 
because we are now want to know that how should we submit the return 
, what are the forms?
First we have ITR one, we also say it has a SAHAJ form 
Sahaj mean simple Yes, Sahaj mean simple 
, it is applicable for individuals
basically  All the individuals those who are having salary income
and one house property and other sources 
, this house property income other sources income,
these are the different heads of income which we have already
discussed in our earlier sessions 
,if you are having salary income
Because I have earned 10 lakh rupees this time  Yes sir 
and if you are having income from House property only one house property
and if you are having income from other sources say interest, dividend
there are different forms of you might be having
incomes under the head income from other sources 
And my income is below 50 lakhs,
if my income is more than 50 lakhs, I cannot
I cannot use ITR 1 SAHAJ  Then suppose I am having salary,
I'm having income from house property, I'm having income from other sources,
but since my income has crossed 50 lakhs, I cannot file ITR one 
, I will have to move ahead to see other forms which forms
I am eager to disclose my income to the income tax authorities  Right 
in which I may file my return of income 
, second we have ITR 2 
ITR 2 is that can be used by individual
as well as HUF Hindu undivided families 
They can also use ITR 2  But,
without having business or professional income 
, if I'm not having any business or professional income,
then I can file ITR 2  Otherwise ITR 2
is not available  Otherwise ,
for a business person it is not available  Yes 
You told that the returns should be submitted 
In my ITR one, the example which I was discussing that my income
since it has crossed 50 lakhs , now, I will have
to opt for ITR 2  In ITR 2, I would be filing my return of income 
, ITR 2 is same to ITR 1, but, that is for incomes
above 50 lakhs and I can I should not be having any short of
business income  And ITR 1 is applicable only to individual 
ITR 1 is simpler then ITR 2 
Yes sir, ITR 1 very simple  ITR 2 give more information  ITR 2 we have
to give more information  ITR 3, ITR 5,
those are containing even more information  , we will we are
Is there is any kind of forms or format by which
coming one by one , ITR one and two 
One thing I would like to discuss  ITR 1 and 2 are basically
written forms which deal only with your income 
, other things are not being taken care in ITR one and two
that means what assets which we have acquired
or what are the assets which we are holdinghama
and what liabilities, what loans, those things
we don't have to report anywhere in ITR one and two 
, this is perhaps one of limitation ITR two twice
I should say, because if it is for more than 50 lakhs,
the return should be submitted to the income tax authorities  Yes,
, there should be some one other
simpler Yeah, it is very, very simpler
at least for salary payers the filing of return is very easy 
So they did not disclosed all these lengthy
forms or anything, ITR two even, Yes, it is always  ITR two a bit,
it is not it is bit lengthier than ITR one, but it's still, it is simple 
So, then we next form we come for ITR 3 that is also
only applicable to individual and HUF
those who are having business income 
Suppose I am having a proprietorship form 
the government has been coming up with ah mt
, the ITR which is applicable to me is ITR three
if I'm an individual  So if I am not an individual, then
we will look for other forms  if I'm an individual or a HUF
and I am having business income, I might be having other incomes also sir 
Yes sir, I might be having salary, I might be having this
house property income  But if I'm earning business income,
then we will have to come to a ITR 3 
selection of ITR forms is very, very
forms are easy, but selection is not that easy 
We have persons should yes, yes it he should have a quitlearner
in this area the government has been changing the forms over last
now listening to it can help others also  Yes, yes, he should have
he should have quite a fair idea of selection  Particular form which is relevant to
which kind yes, yes  Because filing the return in correct
form is very, very important  if I'm having business income,
I might be having other income, but as soon as I have
earned some business income, form number ITR three will be applicable 
So next, we come ITR 4 sugam 
ITR 4 sugam that is also applicable to individual and HUF,
but partnership firms can also file in ITR 4 sugam 
But limited liability partnerships LLPs they can not use ITR 4 SUGAM 
so many years  they are in process of
, we have discussed various aspects of ITR 
Exclusive for this only thing  Ok 
Then ITR 6 is the companies other than the companies
which are registered under Section 25 for claiming deduction
or can be exemption under Section 11 
And those companies who are claiming exemption under Section 11
they have a particular return that is ITR 7 
There is a concept these days with digital signature and they
I can put manual signature also  Yeah 
So what is the process of there is ITR V, we call it 
See this nowadays or in over the last seven, eight years
and there is one more item, sir, capital gains 
the department has been moving more towards electronical filing 
, every year they are making gradually they are
putting some categories compulsorily in e-filing mode 
, every year they are increasing that base of e-filing 
, once we have e-filing our returns
we have to verify the return 
, who has filed the return?
How will suppose if my return anyone can upload
, whether I have uploaded my return or not 
, for that verification, there
If we go through ITR 1, 2, 3, 4 sugam till
there are different modes  I can verify
through EVCor digital signature
or I can send a hard copy of the ITR V
, when I send a hard copy of the acknowledgement
that is known that is known as ITR V  But if we put digital signature
then ITR V is not required to be send, then ITR V is not required to be send 
So nowadays the department is going for digital 
We remember earlier days when we have to prepare the return forms,
go to the Income Tax Office , waiting in queue and then they will
acknowledging by putting a stamp 
, we will see that there is no
So those days are now those days are over sir 
, we have reached a stage that
even scrutinies are being done online 
Before even we don't have to go to the department even for scrutiny also 
Which we will discuss later on, scrutiny assessments and all those 
mention of any capital gains  If I am having capital gains income
which ITR return I will select  So, that is
, in that case ITR 2, we has to be selected 
, if I'm having also having I cannot go for SAHAJ,
in that case  If I , No SAHAJ is not there for capital gains 
SAHAJ is not for capital gains  SAHAJ is for salary,
salary, one house property and income from other sources, not for other head sources 
, CA Nahata has covered so far ITR 1 
No, sir  , in that case I have to select ITR 2,
again if I'm having business income also
and capital gains also then I'll have to go to go for ITR 3,
ITR 2 is not available 
So that is why selection is very important and selection is very important 
now next we come to ITR 5 
, the ITR 5 is for partnership firms 
Then ITR firm is also for a AOP'S,
association of persons or body of individuals
or any other person but not for individual and HUF and companies 
Which is the most simple one the SAHAJ 
Individual HUF and companies 
They cannot use ITR 5, rest all assessee any assessee they can use
ITR 5 like partnership firm, yes,
association of persons, body of individuals, artificial juridical person,
artificial juridical person  Yes, yes yes, they can use ITR 5 
But Individual HUF and companies they cannot use ITR 5,
because for individual and HUF we have already seen that
they are being covered by a ITR 1, 2 , 3 ITR 4 sugam 
, ITR 5 is only for exclusively  Yes sir 
Then next form is ITR 6
Then ITR 2,for the individual and HUF
and that is applicable only for companies 
Only for companies there is a special form that is ITR 6 
which can be used
only by companies except for those companies  
Who are claiming exemption under Section 11 
section 11 that means those companies which are registered
under section 25 of the Companies Act 
They are claiming exemption under Section 11 of the Income Tax Act 
, for them this ITR 6 normally for nonprofit business  Yes sir 
non  non profit, except those companies who are claiming under Section 11
who do not have business income,
all other companies they are to fight  Yeah,
whether domestic whether foreign all any company yes,
ITR 6  As I remember ITR 6 relates to only
only companies which are engaged in all profit making company 
But the whose object is making profit 
And then last form we have that is ITR 7 
, ITR 7  ,it it is to be used for
a used by charitable persons in fact 
, they are section 139 Sub Section 4A to 4D 
, they are being used by Charitable Trusts, political parties 
but income is more than rupees 50 lakhs in a year 
, these type of entities they have to use ITR 7 
Charitable persons who are claiming such exemption under Section 11
as we discussed in ITR 6 
ITR 6 may we have discussed that companies
which are claiming exemption under Section 11
they cannot use ITR 6, they have to use ITR 7 
ITR 6 those companies were claiming under section 11
for them ITR 7  Yes sir 
, in these way ITR from ITR 1 to ITR 7
whole gamut of assessees are covered  Yes 
Then came to ITR 3 with individual HUF,
, if we recap this discussion, ITR 1 SAHAJ
is for individual and HUF, who have got
income from salary, income
income from only one house property and income from other sources
and the total income does not exceed rupees 50 lakhs 
Yeah you can add one thing also sir, that carry forward of losses 
That is not permitted in ITR 1 
Even in house property, I have carry forward of loss
we cannot use ITR  If you are not able to set it off completely during that year 
, if you have left if you're left with , any loss
who have business income and ITR 4 and a detailed discussion about
which has to be carried forward  Actually in a chapter of
set of and carry forward losses, we have elaborately discussed the carry forward 
, as learners know that in case of house property
carry forward of loss is possible for eight assessment years 
So, in that case if there is anything to be carried forward
in house property,, ITR 1 cannot be for them  Then ITR 2 
House property as well as other sources also that might have be loss 
Same case of house property or in case of other sources wherever
carry forward is not possible to be shown in ITR 1 they will go for ITR 2 
, ITR 2 is available to individual an HUF,
the assessees, who are eligible for presumptive taxation 
but without any business or professional  Right 
And ITR 3 is individual and HUF who are having their business income 
, business or profession  Right sir 
And ITR 4, you have elaborately discussed the sugam form
that is for the people for the assessees
who are eligible under presumptive taxation 
And ITR 5 , it is exclusive for firms,
association of persons, body of individual or artificial juridical person 
And in ITR 5, we have talked about something extra
about this are exclusively for this only 
I think there are more  Yes sir, there are more
, as we have already started a discussion about the
, what is the importance of filing the return within the due date?
So that also we have to appreciate 
If I do not file my return within due date, what I can loss,
or what are the extra privileges which I'm getting 
, that has to be those have to be appreciated 
, one of the privilege which I loss
if I do not file my return within the due date
is that I cannot carry forward my losses  Oh great limitations  Very much 
, it's a learning point again 
Secondly, if the loss is not reported within the due time,
because department is providing offline utilities as well 
then the losses cannot be allowed to be carried forward in future  Yes,
business loss, capital loss,
loss Property loss so
those losses cannot be lost property loss can be carried forward ,
if I do not report it  if
if you do not report you cannot carry forward any loss, but
for business loss, capital loss you have to file the return within the due date 
That is yet another condition 
, if you do even if you have reported
but you have reported after the due date,
, we can fill our return in offline utilities,
you are not entitled for setup for carry forward
and subsequently setup  And secondly, if I want to claim
deductions, there are certain deductions or exemptions
for which the department has
put certain restrictions that you have to file the return within the due date 
Suppose 80IA, 80IB, 80IC,
for setting up the profits and gains of industrial undertakings 
If I want to claim those deductions, I have to file the return within the dute date 
, I cannot claim any deduction once I
file the return beyond the due date 
we can generate a file and we can upload the same after uploading 
So filing the return within due date is a very good habit 
And one should always strive
for filing the returns within due date, because
earlier there was one more privilege
, they have discontinued that earlier,
you could revise your return only if you have filed within the due date 
But now, you can revise it and even if even if you have filed
after the due date, we will come on later on  So
return of loss is compulsory for any carry forward afterwards
only reporting is not sufficient for business losses,
, we can file a return 
for capital loss or for loss from activity of owning maintaining
race horses etc  submission of return of loss is very important 
, as you have told that only reporting is not sufficient, right sir,
submission of return of loss is very important,
because if it is not submitted on time or within the due date,
losses like business loss, capital loss, loss from activity of owning
and maintaining race horses, etc 
are not allowed to be carried forward for a while  Yes sir 
We can find our return in both modes 
We can file physically, that means going to
the income tax office and we can file electronically also for
which categories physical returns is allowed, we will discuss that 
Only for senior as of now,
only for senior citizens, physical filing of return is permissible now 
mode of submission, right sir, there I told you that earlier
For rest for all we have to file
compulsory in e-filing  logic a lot
we hope that the senior citizen may not be
so much comfortable with e-filing Yes, yes, obviously, online transaction, yes, yes, yes,
and that's why probably, that is why offline mode
They have excluded senior citizens,
only those senior citizens whose income does not exceed five lakhs 
not for rich senior citizen 
only those people can go for offline mode  Yes sir 
Otherwise, online is compulsory 
the return from we had to fill it up manually, go to the income tax department,
Online return they even for them also online is compulsory
but senior citizens they can file their returns
in physical mode  But if you have a refund
if you want to claim a refund or if your income is more than 5 lakhs,
then in all cases that written has to be filed electronically 
It must be signed digital signature No no not
electronically we will discuss there are
Ok, as you already mension, in case of electronically  Yeah,yeah
, if I file electronically <lpthen I can file it
electronically under digital signature, I can file electronically under EVC 
stand in the queue, and then we get a stamp,
, what is EVC 
, EVC is a OTP which we receive
on our mobile number which is linked to our Aadhar 
, that verification code, electronic verification code
a code will come on your mobile
on that particular mobile number which is linked to your aadhar account 
, using that code you can e-verify your return 
And the third mode is by dispatching the ITR V physically 
, once I opted for the above two modes,
say digital signature or EVC, then I don't have to send
and then we come back keep the things  Nowadays what we are doing is just putting
ITR V anymore , ITR V sent to
CPC Bengaluru Central Processing centre 
The purpose is that the income tax department wants to verify
the person who has put the electronic form in the
income tax website is the original person  Right sir 
If he see Rajkumar Nahata, he is submitting his own income tax return
he should be he himself who should submit it  Right 
I should I cannot put his return
myself because in that case, the OTP and verification
should be that will understand Otherwise,
the things in the online format, making a click and we are submitting 
it will create a huge problem  A will fill up the form for B,
B will fill up the form for C and making a huge confusion 
And that's why to verify theperson
who is filing the return is the original assessee or not  This process are there 
And there is a time limit also to to verify your returns 
Within a particular period  Yes, within a period of 120 days
from the date of filing of return, you have to verify the return 
, what happens if I do not verify it within a period of 120 days 
, my return will become invalid 
It will be presumed as if I have never filed my return 
But there are in income tax that there are different mode of submission  Yes sir 
Again I have to refile my return 
But nowadays our experiences is good  We get a regular sms 
yes, yes we get regular SMS, regular e-mails,also come
emails also sir  emails department is that okay, you have submitted
nobody else has submitted your return 
Because the return can be processed or returns would be
brought up for processing only after the verification party source 
, merely uploading is not complete filings 
Income tax department will verify  Yes,
you will have to verify that I have filed return  I am the person yes, yes, fine 
So can you just elaborate on the mode of submission on this? Yes, yes, sure 
After that, the department will take up that written for processing
not before that  Once that verification part is pending
till that time the case will not be taken up for process 
, we have learned the process of filing of return
and also the verification of return in this discussion 
I see Nahata, normally the people will earn income and income tax
every presume that people earning income 
Sometimes people incur loss also
in business and professional is a common feature
that losses occur  So what is the process of informing
, we can prepare our return
the losses earned by a business
or in under any other head to the income tax authorities 
, it is very important for us to report the losses
because the department has provided us a facility of
setting of those losses in the subsequent years 
, if we do not report our losses properly,
we will loss that privilege of setting  We have already seen the rules
for carry forward losses in certain heads of income,
Income Tax Act allows carry forward of losses 
, a few moments back, we were discussing about due dates 
in both online and offline mode
as you are telling that due date is so important,
income tax department and the authorities are making it as simple as possible 
But even then, in some cases there are certain technical thing
where a layman may not be able
to fill it up everything or upload it or upload the documents 
And there is a concept called TRP's under section 139B,
then this TRP's normally help the assessees in filing the returns 
Can you just tell learners about the profession of tax return preparers?
Yes, learners tax return preparers 
,if I am facing any difficulty in filing my return
or uploading my return or I am not that much computerheavy 
, you can file your return even after the due date,
I don't know these technical things, how to
download the offline utilities, how to create a XML file, how to upload that 
, I can take the assistance of tax return preparers 
So tax return preparers, they are
the return preparers which was certified by the income tax department 
, if you want to become a tax return preparer you can log in
to incometaxindia gov in and therethe required
formalities the required qualifications the required procedure
all those are elaborately discussed in the department's website 
,we can take their assistance  , it is a very good
but not indefinitely  There is some limit there also 
career or good prospect you can do a lot and you can help a lot of people
as well as helping yourself 
,learners you have seen there is a provision of tax return preparers 
, you yourself can become the TRP's
or through this learning you can also tell others
that is how to become the tax return preparers 
So, that limit is one year from the end of the financial year 
Before, suppose financial year is 1920,
it ends on 31 March 2021 
, I have a time up to 31st March 2021, to file the return,
after that not allowed  After that it is not allowed at all,
only you can file your return in response to Section 140 to 140,
which we will discuss later on  ,
so that means I can take advantage of Section 139 (4),
suppose somehow and assessee misses the due date, right
if an assessee misses the filing of return
within the due date in that case within one year
from the end of the relevant financial year  Yes, he or she is
eligible to file belated return, belated return can also be filed 
, there is a provision of charging of interest
for late late submission  of return, Yes, sir,,
can you discuss something on
Earlier, we hadand still now that provision is there
that provisions is Section 234A, which provides for
interest on interest for delay filing of returns 
is there is any provision for submitting belated return 
, if I'm filing or if I'm filing my return beyond the due dates
I am liable for interestthat is under Section 234A that is
1%of the tax payable for every month or part thereof 
, suppose if I my due date is 31st July
and I pay my tax on first September 
, I will have to pay interest for two months,
August and September also  , once even
if I pay on first September or 30th September,
I have to I have to pay interest
for the full month because that that is the language or part thereof 
Yes,suppose if I am not able to fill my return under
, even if I pay during the month interest for
the entire month has to be charged 
, there is one , to ensure timely filing,
, the government has also come up with
a new section 234Fwhich is for delay filing of returns,
suppose my due date is 31st July and in that case we have to classify
to find out what which file is applicable to me
there are two slabs 5000, 10,000, 1000, 5000, 10000 slabs 
, if my income is more than five lakhs,
even if my tax payable is zero,
the provisions as prescribed under Section 139 (1)
yes, yes tax payable is immaterial 
What is my tax payable that is not matter?
It might be that I am I am entitled for a refund 
I don't have any tax payable but I am entitled for the refund
even than Yes sir , even then,
what happens if I file my return after the due date
and my income is more than five lakhs 
, if I file before 31st December
then the fine is 5000
And if I file from first January to 31st March,
that is within the due date My due date is 30th September or 31 July
then the fine is 10,000 rupees  Ok 
, learners its very important point which CA Nahata has told
that earlier there was only section 234A 
Which was interest was imposed at the rate of one person per month 
The problem was that for the assessees who has got taxable income nil
the interest will also come in nil 
To deal with such situation the penalties imposed under Section 234F
where three categories
it is exactly not a penalty sir, it is a fee  It is a fee okay 
, Remember the term is fee  Because you have to pay it
whatever due date I'm having, but I'm not able to file the return
while filing the return, penalty penalty is payable only once it is imposed 
Okey good , just note the difference between the term
it is known as fee,yes , if the return is, belated return is submitted
within 31st December then the
and income is more than five more than five lakhs, the amount of
fee will be rupees 5,000, otherwise it will be 10,000
and if my income is below five lakhs, ok
then the fees will be 1000 till 31st march 
, this is section 234F being introduced recently 
, suppose I am a good citizen,
within the due date then is my right lost 
I have not missed the date within due date, I have filed the return 
But somehow I have just remember that I missed certain points to mention
in the return or I think that no there was some mistake
in the return by omission or commission 
Is there any provision for filing revised return?
Yes sir  Revised section 139(5) that is dealing with revised returns 
, we have a section in place for that also 
Suppose if I discover any omission or I find that
I missed some income which was required to be reported or
any other omission or which I come toknow
that is the It is not  Section 139(4)
before the end of the assessment year 
After assessment it is not allowed  No sir 
Suppose for financial year 31st March 2019, 2018-19
I can revise my return up to 31st March 2020 only 
, revise return facilities given but
an assessee must submit the revise return within the assessment year 
And for filing a revised return we have to obviously we
we must have filed an original return 
Yes,, this is another learning which we have 
, as in the tax return also we have learned that pay the
that isdealing with belated returns 
, CA Nahata, let us go for a very very important term
, once we file our returns,
our duties or parties over
, the department comes into play
the department's role that will come into play 
, the income taxover the last
decade or two,it has been putting more thrust on self assessment 
, whatever you submit, they accepted 
So they are relying very much on the assesses 
You report your transactions
in a very true and fair manner 
, by we have to quote our PAN
So they are giving more importance to self assessment 
, there are over the years the
selection of cases for scrutiny or detailed scrutiny
those also have come down considerably 
And now it is most of the returns are processed based on what we have filed 
, they are relying more on
their database PAN, Aadhar and on all those things 
, even It is not that whatever I report that will be
because they have certain checks 
There are many things suppose, if I have earned
in different places while opening a bank account,
some income from Tejpur University
they have paid me they have deducted tax from me
they have obtained my PAN  , if I
think that I can hide that income from department,
it is not  They are already having that information 
, we have to be very honest 
If a good citizen nobody cut deduct tax, yes
as a good citizen  We have to be honest  You have to be honest 
We have to be honest  Now if you have noted CA Nahata I was told
that recently the entered scope has changed
say while purchasing any immovable property or various other transactions
earlier, one person used to submit return Income Tax
Department has to ask the person 
Yes, scrutiny has all the returns
, in majority of the cases,
whatever a person submits to the income tax authorities,
it will be taken as true 
, it depends on the individual to tell to disclose
the entire things as honestly as possible to honor
the respect which the income tax department is deposed on individual 
And this is what we are talking about self assessment 
have been prescribed by the government where
, suppose I have calculated my income as 12 lakh rupees  Okay sir 
And I have seen that this income tax come as,
So what I should pay the tax on my Yes sir,
after I have calculated my tax liability, and after adjusting
the text which has already been deducted by various deductors
and the advanced tax which I might have already paid doing that financial year itself,
whatever balance is left
that has to be paid by me before filing of return or
what happens can I file my return without paying self assessment tax,
I can file my return without filing self assessment tax,
quoting of PAN has been made mandatory 
but that will be considered as a defective return 
, I will get a notice
that your return is defective since you have not
paid the self assessment tax and you have file the return 
So that defect has to be rectified by or removed by me within the next 15 days 
, it is better that we pay our self assessment and
then later on file our returns, because we'll have to pay interest also 
Till the date we do not pay taxes 
, this is the self assessment tax
under Section 140A, which you are talking 
, when does the liability for
obtaining PAN arisesor when it is compulsory that
we have to apply for a PAN  , see there are
various situations in which the liability may occur  Number one,
first of all and the foremost for most important is
which now everybody is knows that is the PAN permanent account number,
when my income crosses the basic threshold limit 
at thisYes, once it crosses to 50,000,
I have to apply for an PAN,
or if my turnover is more than five lakhs
turnover that means the sales
or if I'm doing any business and my sales is more than five lakhs
then also I have to apply for a PAN,
although my income might not be 250 
,because if I'm making a turnover five lakh say
I might be earning only 70,000 or one lakh or 50,000
I think it is a revolutionary step that
but still I need toapply for PAN 
And I have seen the use of PAN everywhere  Yes 
In many cases when we go the people ask
your PAN and it is a mandatory field, in many cases 
Credit cards suppose you are if your limit is more than two lakhs,
there also they will ask for PAN,
immovable property if you register any immovable property for more than
a specified value of prescribed value by the government
which presently is 25 lakhs for
small cities 50 lakhs for big cities 
the government took one time to have permanent account number for each assessee 
For any transactions more than rupees 50,000
PAN is mandatory  PAN is mandatory sir  And when do you say 10
alphanumeric, alphanumeric number which gives identification
of an assessee with the income tax department 
So the fourth character of the PAN, we can
find out the status, we can find out
whether the person is an individual, is a partnership firm,
is a company or is a trust, whatever corporate society
the fourth character is the ADGP, P means person, I'm an individual,
ADGF, firm, ADGC company 
, can you just a highlight 
, the fourth character we can add,
, it is alphanumeric sequence of 10 digits 
, each digit, each digit having its own significance 
, only fourth character, we know, rest of the characters they
we don't have any idea what what that is  Yeah,
may be stay yeah, yeah they are some because they are confidential as well 
Fourth character is public that we can identify with the PAN
that who is the what is the status of the person 
Yes, what is the status we can find out that 
, you see Indian experience with PAN is not so much
Yes sir, PAN as we say permanent account number of PAN
satisfactory, you can say, because Indians are intelligent 
Many people had got two three PAN, multiple PAN and
income tax department that got huge problem in dealing with such kind of people 
,we have Aadhar  Yes  And quoting of Aadhar number is
also there in many income tax transactions  Yes 
, Aadhar number also, Aadhar was also introduced
not only for income to Income Tax Department, but it was, the Aadhar as we everyone know
that is a biometric , we have to give our biometrics to the Uidai 
, they are taking on biometrics
and they are preparing a database of Aadhar 
that isour identity with the department 
, so far as income tax
or income tax department is concerned 
, they have made it mandatory
for linking of Aadhar to PAN 
,the reason behind or the logic behind this is
that the duplication of pan that can be done away
completely with this  , I can have duplicate PANS,
I can have 10 PAN, but I cannot have 10 biometrics,
I can have only one biometric 
,the rest nine PAN they will become defunct 
, department identifies us by our PAN 
There is a development in this particular field,
and we can see that many problems can be solved 
Yeah, that tippers now government is set up the deadline as well
for linking of Aadhaar with PAN  , it has been
increasing the time limits or it has been constantly
extending the deadlines, but still in the coming times it has,
it will be compulsively for everyone to link aadhar with 
, learners please suggest all to have one single PAN
and also the Aadhar, because at one point of time in very distant future,
that without these two numbers, you cannot move anywhere 
And through this pan, they they also
Even if you have a passport, you have to go somewhere
these two numbers are very much needed not only for income tax purposes,
but for any kind of transactions 
Direct_Tax_4767
, let us discuss about the very important aspect of assessment procedure 
As CA Nahata is in the profession for last 20 years
has been doing with this
assessment procedure for a long period of time 
, let us ask the different kinds of assessments
which we have and let's please discuss about the assessment procedure 
make their database of information 
, I think that the complete
They have come up with online scrutiny
and slowly slowly it is they are expanding the base 
,earlier it was for big cities,
,in small town  In this discussion we have seen
that under Section 142 if the assessee has not filed return,
in that case, the income tax department can ask
for filing of After filing also they generally issue notice under Section 142 if,
if the return is selected for scrutiny  Ok,
and then 142(1),142(2) and 143, 143(1),(2), (3) 143(1)
143(2)and 143 (3), these are the assessment in respect of the
both the sections are there for giving notice to the assessee asking
notice which is issued by the department 
So the cases are taken up for scrutiny, more scrutiny 
some information from them or asking from them to file the returns 
You have not filed a writen till now  , after the
due date goes after due date passes and the assessing officer
sees that still the assessee is not find the return and there is
some information with him, suppose some text has been deducted
or some he has purchased some property and all
those things he these are very common in your practice 
Yeah, 142 is very common  142A is very limited use 
So remember learners if I find certain returns and I understand that
independence or complete autonomy cannot be given to the assesse, Yes,
no income tax department will not ask for anything
suppose I am claiming an exemption
for 80C, we all know  That is no sir,142 is
after I file the return there is no 142  Ok
So 142 is suppose the due date has passed on 
and I not file my return till now 
So the department can issue 142 me  142 to keep up you file your return ok
, the department will it can ask
some information from me, weather I'm having some taxable income or not 
Suppose I build a very huge building 
there must be some kind of fear of assessment 
Department does not know whether I'm filing a return 
So they will issue notice under Section 142  <>?b
What is your return filing status  Till what date you have filed returns 
,they know that you are having a immovable property 
, they will find out from that information whether,
first of all whether you are filing your returns or not 
,if they see that you are not filing they can again
extend those inquiries and take further steps 
And what is 143(2) and 143 
143(2) and 143 and 143 (1) also  Ok  See 143 (1) is summary assessment
, there is section 142A talking about certain
or the returns which we are filing 
,the departments they are assessing except for prima facie adjustments 
Suppose prima facie if the department comes to
the see that there is any error which is on the face of it 
It is evident or there are no two opinions possible about that 
Suppose I have claimed depreciation at the rate of 40% instead of 60% 
,there are no two opinions and from a prima facie
not informed the acceessee no no not requried Yes,yes
But but generally they give a chance 
Generally they give they give a communication type of thing
enquiry  142,142A both sections are there 
to be , we we want or we are proposing adjustment 
yes, the income tax department ex parte
will assess the tax without calling  But the Still generally they give a communication,ok
We are proposing some adjustments under Section 143(1),ok
otherwise they can do,yeah because the recently , the Delhi High Court
in Section 245 they have given a judgment
under section 255,you cannot adjust a refund
without giving an oppurtunity to the assessee ,
to be on the safe side they communicate,
they communicate to the assessee  143(2)
, 142 if the there is some information with
and 143(2), 143 (3),143(2) , the department has a system of
system which is CASS computer assisted scrutiny selection
and manual selection of cases for scrutiny 
, so far as manual selection is concerned,
they come out with guidelines  Every year they come out with guidelines
for selecting certain cases manually 
say, if I if a survey has been undertaken at my premises,,
that case has to be compulsively taken up for scrutiny 
If the department is impounded some books some records,
then that case is required to be scrutinized compulsory 
the assessing officer on during the financial year,
,that is covered under manual selection 
, computer assisted scrutiny selection
under that they are selecting some percentage
1%, 2%, 3% every year  It's automatically? Yeah,automatically,
it is not automatically even I will
there are also they have some criterias 
,they put some criteria, if there is some if the system notices some
unusual happenings in data  Suppose my capital last year was 50 lakhs 
Now it has become three crores ,the department
other than profit, other than profit, it has increased
, he can call for some information or he can
considerably or my salary credit on my current ratio is negative,
my creditors are very high  ,those cases the
computer, it selects and selection under Section 143(2)
is also two types  Earlier it was only one type detailed scrutiny 
,the department has come up with new concept, limited
and complete scrutiny 
,under Section 143(2) if they come up with limited scrutiny 
so, scrutiny will be limited only to that particular point
on the basis of which the scrutiny has been
taken during demonetization 
based on that information he can make further inquiries and
,demonetization period during demonetization period
I deposited say 50 lakhs in my account 
,the department wants to scrutinized that particular thing only
that is limited scrutiny  The assessing officer cannot touch on
other areas he cannot
make roaming inquiries  Only for the particular activity, Yes,
particular scope, particular point, point on which
scrutiny has been selected  Yes, And complete scrutiny is that means,
they will complete this scrutiny and all the things 
And nowadays the scrutiny also is online  Yes,
or he can initiate some proceedings even 142, 142A
So the notice has been given and the assessee is cooperating, yes,
First of all, he must have reasons to believe
or he must have adequate reason to believe
that income has escaped assessment 
Simply on guesswork or simply
on some information, he cannot initiate 147 
Because since it is a bit harsh provision,
so it cannot be initiated like it  Is it common?
It is very uncommon, sir, very uncommon and it is used 
Nowadays it is not used rarely I would say
it is being used very often, quite often but not very often quite often 
E-mail id and phone number  , in as we know in India,
Because nowadays,what happens,the department, what has happened 
Now the department is more equipped with information 
So what is happen, and now it is the department has
built up a very good database they are having
very beautiful information regarding every assessee 
Where I am traveling, what I am spending where I am going 
,they are having virtually at the click of a button,
they have all the information with them 
nowadays this 147, as started to started to be used
very conscious  So learners now very, very conscious,
most of the people they don't use computers or they don't have computers 
you cannot give any wrong information,
because you are digitally connected from everywhere 
if you have given some information somewhere else,
you do not think that it is linked,
but somewhere the income tax department will get the information
and there is a scope for reassessment 
Thank you CA Nahata, it is a nice talking to you, to
learn about all about the return of income and assessment 
It was my pleasure also,sir  To invite you for another discussion also 
Thank you, sir  Thank you  Thank you very much  Thank you 
They are dependent on others  Suppose I have approached
some of my friend, you prepare my income tax login 
, he also don't know that he's not that much expert,
, he used his phone number and e-mail id
mobile number, mobile number and e-mail id 
,whatever notices whatever communications the department is
going through going for paperlessYes,
All correspondence that person yeah that particular mail id or
assessee has gone there, yes, whatever the department,sometime
that particular person's on phone  So, it is very important,
very very important that we give only those mail IDs or phone numbers 
Which we are regularly accessing 
Otherwise we will never come to know about the communication 
Suppose my case has been selected  Recently I came up with
such type of case what there was one person
so he was staying in a very remote area , he wanted to file the return
,he approached someone he file his return,
email id and phone numbers will not
of that particular assessee those were of some different person 
happens that the income tax department issues notice 
,the case was selected for scrutiny
because he has claimed a huge exempt income 
He was a tribal so he claimed huge exemption,76 lakhs 
,he never came to know about that
,department was quite right, because they had sent notices
on that particular mail id and all those things 
, the ITO
since he'd never received he never came up,
came before the assessing officer, he neverreplied to those notices 
, at the end of because see 143(1),143(2) there is time limits 
The assessee is not hearing about this neither he or she has
Those assessments have to be completed within a certain time frame 
,once a case has been selected for one,
,I would like to add here 143(2&3), the time limits
within which the case when case can be selected and the
time limit within which the case has to be disposed 
This is for both the sides ,yes assessee as well as departemnt ,yes,
,143 (2),if my case has to be selected, it can be selected only
within a period of six months from the end of the financial year 
, for 31st,March 2019,
30th, September 2019 is the last day before which the
cooperated with the department
department can select the case for scrutiny 
After that, they cannot no, after that there are different provisions
through which they can trap mee, but not under this section 
My case cannot be selected for detailed scrutiny after 30th September 
, once it has been selected, now, there is a time frame
for them to complete the assessment as well 
,earlier it was 12 months now, it has been reduced to nine months 
Great learning from him all this time limits etc 
There is a term for best judgment assessment 
That is what I was suppose, so, till the assessing officer will
and sometimes the department itself can go for a certain time 
wait till the time frame under which he which is required
to complete the assessment  otherwise he will be,yeah
Because he will before that also you can complete
by giving reasonable opportunities 
Suppose I have given notice licensing officer he has issued notices three or four times 
To the assessee, but there has been no response 
So, the assessing officer can go on to
proceed or to complete the assessment
under Section 140 for the best judgment assessment
which you are speaking about 
yes,sir nowadays, it is happening more 
,I am not cooperating or
even if I received the notice I am not cooperating
or the informations which I furnished
they are not sufficient 
,he can complete the assessment
cases  Certain cases, certain condition, if there is fullfill
the assessing officer can go you can initiate invoke
jugdement it is not to penalize the assessee,
but as per the assessing officer give judgment
then this should be , And one thing is very important 
what has happened, this
This best judgment assessment can be made only on the basis of the
information which is available with the AO 
Suppose, there is information that
I am having an immovable property but the AO's not having any information about that 
,he cannot bring on that, but he knows me personally suppose
that property cannot be brought in best judgment assessment 
,only on the basis of matters which is available within
based on that he has to make the best judgment 
Suppose, the assessing officer has made an assessment
and is there is a provision for reassessment also 
is,what practically it is going on 
Yes sir  , once
I have filed my return or if even if I have not filed my return
There is the
if I have not filed my return still the case can be reopened 
, there are certain conditions, so, that
was section 147 and 148, 149,150,151 
They are dealing with reassessment procedures 
,147 is the section under which the AO will issue the notice 
, before initiating 147
the AO's has to make sure two things 
,while filing or returns, two fields are very important 
in the following year in which the assessee
earned his or her income and the tax payable in the previous year
is computed in the following year that is in the assessment year 
,what happens whether the assessee
will have to pay the tax in the next year?
Yes, he or she has to pay the tax
in the next year in total or in settlement of his or her account of tax,
but there is a rule of advance payment of tax, which says
that pay the tax as you earn 
,this is known as an advance payment of tax 
Welcome learners Today, we'll be learning
It is obligatory to pay Advance Tax in every case,
where the advanced tax payable is rupees 10,000 or more 
However, a senior citizen not having income for business
from business or profession is not liable to pay Advance Tax
from the assessment year 2013-14 but for other assesses
it is compulsory to pay Advance Tax And the Income Tax Act as
specified four dates by which part by part, the assessee should pay
the tax during the year in which he or she earns the income 
The first date is 15th of June  By 15th of June, not less than 15%
of the tax liability is to be paid
advanced payment of tax 
on or before 15th of September, not less than 45% of the tax liability
as reduced by the amount if any paid is to be paid
by 15not less than 75% of the
advanced tax liability is to be paid 
And by 15th of March,
the whole amount of advance tax liability as reduced by the amount if paid
on the earlier assessment must be paid by the assessee 
, there are four dates of advanced tax,
please remember and note number one 15th of June
that is 15% of advanced tax liabilities to be paid ,
When we discuss the basic concepts,
15th of September, by this time 45%
of the advanced tax liability is to be paid,15th of December
by this time 75% of the advanced tax liability is to be paid 
And by 15th of March 100%
that is the whole amount of advances liability is to be paid 
,any amount paid by way of advanced tax
on or before 31st March shall also be treated as
advanced tax paid during each financial year 
,if an assessee defaults in pay off Advance Tax,
or pay short of the required amount, then rate of pay interest will be charged
We have discussed the concept of previous year and assessment year 
at the rate of 1% per month or for the part that is or for the part
of the month they are off,same way,the income department also pays
the interest in case there is a delay in refund
or access recovery, but the rate is 0 5% per month or part of the month 
, this is about the advanced payment of tax, which says that
pay as you earn, and I repeat there are four important dates
to be noted 15th of June,15 of September, 15 of December and 15th of March 
I told you that the income year is known as
the previous year  That is the year in which the assessee earns his or her income
and the following the previous year,the year is known as the assessment year
in which his or her income is assessed to tax 
,normally, the income tax is calculated
, let's see the topic of tax deduction at source 
like alcohol, it is 1%, tendu leaves it is 5%,
timber obtained under a forest license 2 5%,
timber obtained by any other mode is 2 5%,
any other forest produce not being timber
, there is a difference between the terms TDS and TCS 
In case of TDS it is tax deducted at source
and from the income the person who is paying the income
will deduct the tax at source 
On the other hand tax collected at source is that here
Section 192A deals with premature withdrawal
that certain sellers of certain goods are required to collect tax
from the purchaser of such goods 
from employees provident fund  It says that any person
authorized under the scheme to make payment

if the amount of such payment in aggregate
is less than rupees 50,000 
Section 193 deals with interest on securities,
the Interest on securities the rate at which the tax deductible
It is most commonly known as TDS

and resident and non corporate assessee 
It is not applicable in certain specified securities 
Section 194 deals with the dividends
the rate of deduction of tax in respect of dividend is 10% 
But it is not applicable if the dividend income is received from companies
and which does not exceed rupees 2,500 during the year

The rate at which is deducted is 10% 
Both in case of resident, non corporate assessee and domestic companies,
That is, the income tax department

If the aggregate amount of interest paid
does not exceed rupees 5000  Rupees 10,000 limit
is given in respect of interest paid
on time deposits with a banking company 
Winning from lotteries, crossword puzzles, horse races etc 
the pay that is the paying authority
is required to deduct income tax there from at the rate of 30%
if the amount of payment exceeds rupees 10,000 
Payment to contractors and subcontractors 
gives some kind of responsibility
Under Section 194C, the rate of TDS under Section 194C
on payment to contractors is 1% where the pay is an individual or HUF
and 2% in respect of other kinds of persons 
No deduction will be required to be made if the consideration for the contract
does not exceed rupees 30,000 
Insurance Commissionunder Section 194D,
such person is required to deduct income tax at the rate of 5%
if the amount of such income or the aggregate of the amounts of such income
credited or paid during the financial year
to this account exceeds rupees 15,000 
to the drawing and disbursing officer

Section 194-DA, section 194-DA provides
before deduction of tax at the rate of 1%
or on any sum paid to a resident

Which are not exempt under Section 10(10D)
tax deduction is required
only if the payment or aggregate payment in a financial year
of an assessee is rupees one lakh or more

any amount from National Savings scheme accounts shall deduct income tax 
There on at the rate of 10% at the time of payment 
No such deduction shall be made, but the amount of payment
is of the aggregate is less than rupees 2500 
Repurchase of units by mutual funds or unit Trust of India 
A person responsible for paying to any person
Number one, section 192 deals with
any amount on account of repurchase of units
covered under Section 80CCB
shall deduct taxes at source at the rate of 20%
at the time of payment of such amount 
Commission on the sale of lottery tickets etc

says that any person who is responsible for paying
any income by way of commission
other than Insurance Commission on brokerage shall deduct tax
at the rate of 5%  No deduction is required if the amount is
less than rupees 15,000 during the previous year 
In general, we can say that 10% is the rate for TDS 
And the person who is go adoing the tax
deduction of tax at source must issue a certificate
for that is the deduction of tax at source 
Section 197 also discusses
when it being paid to various employees that DDO is responsible
the certificate for deduction of tax at a lower rate 
You can refer to the study materials for detailed discussion
of the sectionand also section 204 where the person responsible
for paying taxes will deduct at source 
, let's see the tax collection at source
under Section 206C  Under Section 206C(1)
sellers of certain goods are required to collect tax
from the buyers at specified rate 
With the specified percentage of collection for taxes
are provided for certain categories of items
to deduct the amount of tax at source 
is taxed by that particular country 
And if we have a double taxation avoidance treaty with that particular country,
then this deductions these rebate are available to the individual assessee 
,if we see the computation of tax of an individual 
Step one, we're to calculate the tax on net income or the total income 
From there, we'll deduct rebate under Section 87A
as I have already told that the deduction is now as high as rupees 12,500
that is, any person earning total income up to rupees five lakh
can avail the deduction Then step three will be step
step one minus step two, that is tax on total income,
computation of taxable income for individuals 
less rebate under Section 87A 
With this we will add surcharge if applicable 
And with the tax, we will add the surcharge
from there, we'll add the health and education Cess
then we will add up with the tax so calculated
and from there the rebate under Section 89,90,90A
and 91 will be there and the result an figure
that is step seven minus step eight will be the tax payable 
We will be discussing some of the solution problems
or cases where we will discuss that is how
, what is the tax incidence on individuals 
the tax of an individual is computed 
Also, please refer to the study materials
to understand the concept more elaborately 
All incomesearned by an individual are taxable
except the incomes under Section 10
to 13A, incometo be included
in income of others by virtue of Section 62 to 64
share of profit from a Hindu undivided family
share of profit from a farm,
except these, all other incomes are taxable in the hands
of an individual  let's see
Welcome learners This week we will be learning
how the income is computed for an individual 
First we have to see as a step one,
we will calculate income under different heads of income 
Different heads of income as you know,
an individual may earned income under the head salaries 
He or she may earn income under the head income from House property,
Profits or gains of business and profession,
capital gains, other sources 
, you we will see the income computed the income
from each head separately  They've already learned each head
computation of taxable income of individuals 
that is how income is calculated from salary, house property,
capital gains, business profession, other sources 
Step two, adjustments of the current year and earlier years losses
under Section 72 to 80 at the eligible losses
which can be adjusted or deducted 
So In this step three, we'll get the income
after adjustment of losses
and which is actually the gross total income 
,from the gross total income, we will deduct the deductions
which are available under Section 80C to 80U 
There are different categories of persons
, when the deductions are made
from gross total income, we get the total income
or the income on which tax will be calculated 
, the importance is that
what are the sections that are eligible to be deducted
under section 80C to 80U 
We have a detailed discussion separately
in the deductions chapter, but even then we think that
let us again recapitulate or again re emphasize
the sections which are available to individuals 
as we have seen under the definition of persons,
As you know number one is the 80C
that is the payment of insurance premiums etc 
80CCC that is notified pension fund, 80CCD to pension schemes,
80CCG notified equity saving scheme,
80D medical insurance,
80DD medical treatment of handicapped dependents,
80DDB expenditure on medical treatment,
80E interest on loan taken for higher studies,
80EE interest on loan taken for residential house property,
80Gdonations, 80GG rent paid,
that individual, farm, association of persons, company,
80GGA donation for scientific research or rural development,
80 GGC contribution to political parties 
80-IA profits and gains of industrial undertakings,
engage in infrastructure development etc 
80IAB profits and gains of industrial undertakings
engaged in development of special economic zones,
80IB profits and gains of industrial undertakings engaged in
projects other than infrastructural development,
80-IBA profits and gains from housing projects 
80IC profits and gains of undertaking in certain states,
body of individuals, artificial juridical person, etc 
80-ID profit of hotels, and convention centers,
80IE profits on undertakings in north eastern states,
80JJA profits from business of collecting biodegradable waste,
80JJAA employment of new employees,
80QQB, royalty income of authors,
80RRB royalty on patents,
80TTAinterest on deposits on savings accounts,
80TTB interest on deposits in banks etc  by senior citizens,
80U income of blind or specially abled persons 
, these are different deductions, which are available
Out of these we'll be learning computation
under Section 80C to 80U to an individual 
So, learners, you must note these particular sections and see that
wherever these deductions are eligible an assessee should avail
the deductions under these sections 
Hence, We have the deductions from tax liability 
We calculate the tax liability from the total income 
Then there are deductions under Section 87A is available
that is whose total income and does not exceed rupees three lakh 50,000 
But this year budget, this limit has been enhanced to rupees five lakhs 
,tax rebate is given under 87A,
of taxable income for individuals as well as for companies 
100% of tax subject to maximum of rupees 2500
but this year's budget it has enhanced to rupees 12,500 
Relief under Section 89 in respect of arrear salary etc 
That is section 89 gives relief 
If a person has received arrear salary which normally is a
substantial amount, then there is a process of
segregation of the income over the years
and an assessee can take relief under Section 89 
And relief for double taxation under Section 90,90A and 91
that is if assesses income in foreign country
,this week, let us devote the time for learning
Welcome learners  In the previous week we have seen
and we hope that here's the right person to discuss
this particular issue before you 
Thank you Sir Kaiser, welcome learners  Let's begin our topic
for today which is computation of taxable income of companies 
We'll start by learning about different definitions of
different types of companies  So, let's begin 
First, we should know what is the meaning of a company 
So, companies defined under section 2(17)
and it means any Indian company
or any body corporate which is incorporated
assessment of tax for individual 
under any loss for foreign country  So, it means any
company which is formed in India or any company which is
incorporated in a foreign country, also it includes any
institution which is declared by the general or specific order of CBDT 
What is CBDT  CBDT stands for Central Board for Direct Taxes 
So, this is the general definition of company 
Now, under company the different types of company,
we said company covers an Indian company 
So, what is an Indian company 
Indian company is covered under section 2(26) and this
This week, we will discuss computation of taxable income of companies 
formed and registered under the Companies Act 1956 and now,
Companies Act 2013  It includes any company which is formed
and registered under any law relating to the company's
formally inforced any part of India other than Jammu and Kashmir 
This means what that if there was any company which was
previously formed in any part of India it would form to be an
Indian company accept any company which was previously
formed in the state of Jammu and Kashmir  Also an Indian company
includes any corporation established under the Central
State or provincial act  Not only this It also includes any
Also various provisions for computation of taxable income,
institution which is declared by the board
Central Board of direct taxes  To be a company last but not the
least any company which is formed under any law which is
enforced in the state of Jammu Kashmir or any company which is
formed under any law in the union territories of Dadra, Goa
Damon and Diu and Pondicherry  So, this was about Indian company 
Next we will know about foreign company  We've learned what an
Indian company is now, we will know about foreign company 
Before knowing about foreign company, we have to know the
meaning of a domestic company only when we learn about the
including a concept called minimum alternate tax 
meaning of domestic company, then we know about the meaning
of a foreign company  So, what is a domestic company  Now
domestic company defination covers two limbs 
First limb is it says that any Indian company is a domestic company 
Second limb says that it can be any company which in respect of its
income is liable to tax under the IT Act, which has made
prescribed arrangements for the declaration and payments within
India of the dividends which is payable out of such income 
So, what does this mean? First limb is clear that it a domestic
companies an Indian company second limbs says that it can be any
To discuss these issues, we have invited CA Rachita Saraf
company not necessarily an Indian company it can be any
company which out of its income, which is liable under the IT act
has made prescribed arrangements for the declaration of its
dividend and payment of such dividend within India also, it
means that such dividend will be payable from the income which is
generated and liable to the Income Tax Act  So, this is the
definition of a domestic company  Now, we come to the
meaning of foreign company  So, any company which is not a
domestic company becomes a foreign company automatically 
Now, another company which is which I think you have
to this program and CA Rachita Saraf
heard about is an industrial company  So, what is an
industrial company, it is any company which is mainly engaged
in the business of generation, or distribution of electricity,
or any other form of power, or in the construction of ships or
in the manufacturer processing of any goods or in the business of mining 
So, any company is engaged in these businesses that
I've just mentioned, will be an industrial company  Now, when I
say that a company is an industrial company doesn't
necessarily mean that the company should be engaged only
in the prescribed businesses that I've mentioned  It can also

the total income of such business of the previous
year from the businesses listed above should not be less than
51% of its total income  So if all those businesses that I
mentioned like business of generation of distribution of
power of electricity or construction of ships or
manufacture processing of goods or mining should constitute at
least 50% of the total income of the company 
And hence it will be known as the industrial company 
and completed her chartered accountancy in 2016 
She is in the independent practice for last two years
Next we will know about a company in which the public are
government or RBI  Any company in which not less than 40% of
the shares in value are held by the government or RBI 
Number two, section 25 company  What is section 25 company?
These are those companies which are made solely for the promotion of
commerce, art, religion, science or charity  So, any section 25
company will also be regarded as a company in which the public are
substantially interested  Third any company without to share
capital is a company in which public has substantially
invested  Number four, Nidhi or mutual benefit company 
what is an Nidhi or mutual benefit company 
substantially interested  What does this mean?
It is any company who is in the business of
acceptance of deposit from its members 
This was number four  Number five company which is owned by
cooperative society  Number six, any listed company and number
seven, public limited company which is owned by the government
and or is a widely held company  So, all these seven cases or any
of these seven cases will be deemed to be a company in which
the public are substantially interested 
Next is investment company 
What is an investment company  A company in which,
section 2(18) defines a company in which public are
whose gross total income consists mainly of income from
house property, capital gains and income from other sources 
So any company which has its gross total income from these three
sources of income will be deemed to be an investment company 
Next is widely held company  We've just learned the meaning
of a company in which public or substantially interested  So,
widely held company is a company in which the public are
substantially interested  And the last definition under
companies is a closely held company  So any company in which
the public are not substantially interested is known as a closely held company 
substantially interested  So the following cases that I will
So these were the different types of companies
that we just learned about 
Thank you CA Saraf for highlighting various types of companies 
Now we have learned the different types of companies, including a
domestic company, a foreign company, an investment company
section 25 company, closely held companies etc  Now we wish to
learn that how the taxable income of a company is
calculated, and what is the procedure for
computation of its tax liability 
Okay, let's move forward to understanding the computation of
mention right now, seven cases I'm going to mention  If these
taxable income and tax liability of companies  So there are six
steps involved in arriving at the taxable income and tax
liability of a company  Step one, first you have to ascertaining
income under different heads of income, like house property,
business, professional, capital gains, other sources etc 
This constitutes your step one, step two talks about income of other
persons, which may be included in the income of the company
under Section 60 and 61  So there are various clubbing
provisions due to which the income of many other people may
be included as the income of the company  So you have to include
cases are there, then it will be regarded as a company in which
that after including other income from different heads 
This is step two  Let's go to step three, which talks about
you about us taking the current and brought forward losses,
which should be adjusted against the income of the company 
Step four, we arrive at the step four, add the resulting figure,
which is the cross total income  So what is your gross total
income, you add all the income from various sources, and heads
of income in step one, in the on that figure you add step two
figure of any income of any other person which may be
included in the income of the company  Step three, you
public are substantially interested  First, if does
subtract and adjust any current or brought forward losses 
This then leads us to arrive at step four, which is called the gross
total income  Now, at step five, what you do is from step four,
you deduct all the permissible sections from section 60 to 60U 
And we come at the last step, which is step six, which
is the resulting sum, which is gross total income minus all the
deductions is the net income on which you tax
income tax at the applicable rate in force 
So, this is how we arrive at the taxable income
and tax liability of a company 
any company which is owned by the government or RBI, it will
be deemed to be a company in which public are substantially interested 
Now, what is a company which is owned by the
So Thank you for giving a detailed step by step analysis of
any 10 consecutive years to claim the deduction and
deduction will be hundred percent of the profit for these
10 consecutive years  However, there's only one thing that you
have to keep in mind that the assessee should start operation
on or after April 1, 1995 but before April 1, 2017 
So this was about case one, under 80IA 
Let's move to case two  Case two under 80IA talks about
telecommunication services  So, any undertaking who is engaged in
providing any telecommunication services  Now, what is
telecommunication services? It includes providing any services,
company can avail to minimize its tax liability?
whether basic or cellular, including radio paging, domestic
satellite service or network of trunking or broadband network
and internet services and electronic data interchange
service at anytime after March 31, 1995 but before March
31, 2005  This is covering telecommunication services 
Now, what is the reduction under case two, which covers
telecommunication services  The deduction should be claimed
as hundred percent of the profits in the first five years and 30%
of the profits in the next five years  Again this span of
10 years, where we came hundred percent for the first five years
You're right sir, not all deductions are available to companies that
and 30% of the profits in the next five years should be within
a span of 15 years from the previous year in which the
undertaking begins providing telecommunication services 
Also, this enterprise that is engaged in providing
telecommunication services should be a new enterprise and
only can you then claim deduction under 80IA 
Till now we've learned about case one and case two under 80IA 
Let's move forward to learning about case three  Case three and the 80IA talks about
industrial parks  So any assessee who develops
or develops and maintains or maintains
different deductions which have been made which are available to
and operates an industrial park
or a special economic zone
as SEZ will be able to claim deduction under 80IA 
Now to claim deduction under 80IA under case three for industrial parks,
it has to start operating during April 1, 2007 and march 31, 2011
for the industrial park and it should start operation during
April 1, 1997 and march 31, 2005 Foreign SEZ unit 
Now, what will be a deduction  A deduction will be hundred
percent of the profit, which will be deductable for 10 years,
commencing from the initial years, but it should fall within
individuals, HUF firms and companies  So in this section but will do
15 years from the start of the previous year in which the
undertaking begins operating or developing industrial park 
This was all about case three 
Let's move forward to case four  Case four talks
about power generation, transmission and distribution
or substantial renovation and modernization of existing distribution lines 
For this, you have to have an undertaking which should be set up in
any part of India for the generation and distribution of power
and this should be done during April 1, 1993 and march 31, 2017 
Only if you fulfill these criterias will you get a deduction under 80IA
is we will only talk about those sections on which company can
under case four  Now, this again the enterprise should be a new
undertaking and here the deductions will be same as that
we discussed in case three 
Last but not the least, is case five 
Case five talks about undertaking setup for the reconstruction of power unit 
Here, it should be an assessee who should own an Indian company
and setup should be for deconstruction or renewal of a power generating plant 
Now such undertaking should begin generation or transmission or
distribution of power before March 31, 2011  The only thing
under the section left to discuss is what will be the deduction 
claim deduction  So let's begin with that  First we're going to
For case five deduction will be same as a
deduction which is discussed under case one under 80IA 
So we've done with understanding 80IA  80IA covers
five cases, and any company forming part of any of these
cases can claim deduction under 80IA 
Next section is also very important 
This section is 80IAB
and this section talks about profits and gains of industrial undertakings
which are engaged in the development of special economic
zone of SEZ  So, who can claim deduction under this section?
know about section 80G  What a Section 80G  It talks about
Any taxpayer who is a developer of SEZ can claim
deduction, the development of the SEZ should begin on or
before March 31, 2017  And if you fulfill these criteria, then
you can claim a deduction of 100% of the profits for 10
consecutive years, falling within 15 years beginning from
the year in which the SEZ has been notified by the central government 
Small section, easy section but an important section 
Let's go to the next section which is 80IAC 
80IAC talks about profits and gains derived from eligible startup 
Under this section, any assessee who can claim a deduction but who should
donations to charitable institutions and funds 
be this assessee it can be only a company or an LLP,
who is engaged in the eligible business  Now, what is an
eligible business under this section  Eligible business would
mean a business which is involves innovation,
development, deployment or commercialization of
new products, processes or services, which is given by
technology or intellectual property  So, these are these
things, which cover the meaning of eligible business under this
section  So any company or LLP was engaged in any of these
eligible business can claim deduction under 80IAC 
Now, who can claim this deduction? Any tax payer can claim this
The only condition is that such company or LLP should be
incorporated after March 31, 2016 but before April 1, 2019 
And the annual business turnover such company or LLP does
not exceed 25 crore in any of the five previous years,
beginning from April 1, 2016  If all these conditions are
fulfilled, then the assessee can claim deduction of hundred
percent of the profit and gains from the business for five
consecutive years beginning from the year in which the eligible
startup is incorporated  Next section is 80IB  Like we have
done earlier, 80IA which talks about five cases  You're also
deduction  So not only a company but any taxpayer can claim
computation of income of companies  So, the details will
will talk about 80IB; 80IB however, has 11 cases under this 
Now what does 80IB cover  80IB talks about
profits and gains of industrial undertakings,
other than infrastructure development undertakings  So 80IA talks
about profits and gains of industrial development
undertakings and various cases under that and 80IB talks
about profit and gains of industrial undertakings
other then infrastructure development undertakings 
So what are the cases that it covers?
It covers 11 cases as I said  Let's talk about the cases 
deduction under 80G  Now, any donation which is made
Case one is business of industrial undertaking 
Case two talks about operation of ship 
Case three talks about hotels  Case four talks about Industrial Research 
Case five is for production of mineral oil 
Case six is for developing and building housing projects 
Case seven is about the business of processing and preservation
and also packaging of fruits and vegetables are integrated
handling storage and transportation of food grains items 
This is case seven  Case eight talks about multiplex theaters 
Case nine talks about conviction centers 
to a national defence fund, or Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund,
Case 10 talks about operating and maintaining a
hospital in rural area and last but not the least,
case 11 talks about hospitals located in certain specified areas 
Now, let's go into each case separately 
Let me first mention that case two,
eight and nine, they are not eligible for deduction
now days they have been removed and are not practically
applicable now days, clear  Now, let's go back to case one 
Under case one, any assessee or company who wants to claim
deduction should be a new undertaking and should
or Prime Minister's drought relief fund or prime minister's
manufacture produce articles  Also it should employed 10
workers, when the manufacturing process is carried on with the
aid of power and 20 workers if the manufacturing processes sky down
without the aid of power  If it fulfills such conditions
then the amount of deduction is hundred percent of the profits
for the first five years and 30% for the next five years 
But in case of a small scale industrial undertaking, the deduction will
be 30% for 10 years  This was case, one under 80IB 
Let's talk about case three  I said two is not applicable 
So we'll jump to case three 
national relief fund and other many such funds are there which
Case three talks about certain hotels, which talks about
deduction for 10 year limit  And this limit was only
till assessment year 10-11  This is all about case three 
Let's move to case four  Case four talks about deduction of hundred
percent of profit for the first five years  If the prescribed
authority approves the company before April 1, 1999
and 10 years if it approves after March 31, 2002, but before April 1, 2007 
So case four talks about two deduction slabs, one where
hundred percent deduction will be for five years
and another one 100% deduction will be for 10 years depending on the
is listed by the government, if you make donation to any such
date just set  Let's go forward  Let's move to case five 
Case five says that there will be deduction
of hundred percent of the profits for the first seven
years only the thing that you have to keep in mind is that the
company should be a new undertaking and it can be
located anywhere in India  Next is case six 
Case six talks about the building area 
It says that the building area of each
residential unit should not be more than 1500 square feet 
But for places like Delhi and Mumbai it should be thousand square feet 
fund, then you can claim a deduction  What is the amount of
Also one residential unit should be allotted to one person
and also not to his spouse or children or HUF 
If all these conditions are fulfilled under case six,
then the deduction is hundred percent of the profit 
Case seven is next  Under case seven deduction is hundred percent for the
first five years and 30% for the next five years 
Eight and nine, as I've already mentioned, is not applicable now days 
So, we will move to case 10  Under case 10
you have to fulfill certain criterias to claim deduction 
Here hospital should have at least 100 beds for patients
deduction  It is hundred percent or 50%, as the case may be,
and the hospital should be constructed between
October 1, 2004 and march 31, 2008 
If this condition is fulfilled, then the deduction will be hundred percent
of the profit for the first five years  Last case that we are moving to is case 11 
And we'll be done with section 80IB 
What does case 11 say?
Case 11 says that you will get hundred percent deduction for
the first five years, if the hospitals are situated anywhere
in India, other than Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai,
Hyderabad, Bangalore, Gurgaon etc  So, it to claim deduction
depending on the fund that you've given the donation to
under case 11 the hospital should be situated in any place
other than these places that I have just mentioned 
So, with this we are done with 80IB 
you will get the deduction automatically and accordingly of
100% or 50%  Now, the next question that you may come
also be available in the e-text to learners please refer to the
up with is, what is the mode of payment of such donation that
you've made  Now, the donation could be made earlier in cash or
by cheque or draft but however, no deduction will be allowed for
an amount exceeding 10,000 in cash from assessment year 13-14 to
assessment year 17-18 and above rupees 2000 from assessment year
18-19  So these are the key points that you have to remember
under 80G in order to claim deduction  Next section is 80GGA
which talks about donation to scientific research or rural development 
Who can claim in deduction 
Any assessee can claim a deduction under this section except an
e-text and also we'll try to do one comprehensive problem on this issue 
assessee, whose income is chargeable under PGBP
and is entitled to claim this deduction in respect of payments or
donations for scientific research or rural development 
Therefore, what does this mean? It means any assessees can claim the
deduction for donations made for scientific research or rural
development excepting those assessees whose income is
chargeable under PGBP  You're also mode of payment can be cash
or cheque or draft, but for cash contribution exceeding 10,000,
it will be disallowed from assessment year 13-14 
Next is 80GGB  80GGB talks about contribution to political parties 
So, we have seen how gross total income of a company is calculated 
Now, what all are covered under 80GGB 
Any contribution that you make to political party is deductable
under this section  If the contribution is made by an
Indian company, here it cannot be any company only an Indian
company can claim deduction under 80GGB  Mainly all the
sections that we are going to talk about is only for
companies  This specific section is for an Indian companies
specifically, yes  Now, any expenditure if you made by way
of advertisement to a magazine, which is owned by a political
party will also be treated as contribution to a political party 
Now we know that from gross total income, a lot of
Now, deduction the section is not available to any
local authority or any artificial judicial person
wholly or partly funded by the government  Also, from
assessment year 14-15 no deduction will be allowed for
any contribution which is paid in cash that means from assesment year
14-15, any contribution which is made to any political
party has to be by cheque or draft 
Now next section is 80IA  80IA is a vast section  It talks
about profit and gains of industrial undertakings which
are engaged in infrastructure facilities  Under the Section there
deductions are available under Section 80C to 80U 
are various cases we'll do and we'll talk about each case specifically 
So let's begin with this section 
Case one, under 80IA is provision for infrastructure facility 
Any enterprise which carries on the business of developing
or maintaining and operating or developing maintaining and
operating of infrastructure facility can claim deduction under 80IA 
Now the first question which arises is what is an infrastructure facility 
So, we should know the meaning of infrastructure facility 
So, infrastructure facility means any road which
includes any toll road, bridge or rail system  It also includes a
But many of the sections are not available to companies like 80C
highway project, including housing or other activity being
an integral part of that highway project  Also, infrastructure
facility will include water supply project water treatment system,
irrigation, project sanitation and sewerage system
or Solid Waist Management System 
Last but not the least, infrastructure facility will
also include any port or airport or inland waterway or inland
port or navigational channel in the sea 
So, this is the meaning of infrastructure facility 
Now, under case one, what is the amount of deduction that comes
is available only to individual and huf  So now we are
into your mind  So, the amount of deduction will be hundred
percent of the profit which is deductible in 10 consecutive
years, which should fall within 15 years beginning with the
assessment year in which the assessee begins operating and
maintaining the infrastructure facility  This means what ? It
means that an assessee is engaged in the business of
infrastructure facility  The year from which he begins this
infrastructure facility operating or maintaining
whichever the case may be from that you will take a timespan of
15 years and within those 15 years, the assessee can choose
interested to know from you that what are the deductions which a
Now, you have discussed the section 80 various provisions in detail 
highlighted the carry forward and set of provisions and the
discussions and example which we have done on carry forward and
set of provisions  We think that learners should have a very,
fairly good idea about the of computation of
income and tax liability of companies 
Thank you very much for coming 
And we hope that we will get again your insights in the future episodes 
Definately 
even under 80C to 80U  Now, there are companies who have
taken full advantages of tax exemption, tax deductions,
and then it some companies we call it ZTC zero tax companies 
These companies show a positive book profit but because of availing
of various sections given under the Income Tax Act, that taxable profit is zero 
The finance act 1987 first introduced the
concept called minimum alternate tax  And when P  Chidambaram was
the finance minister in 1997-98, he introduced a under section 15JA
whereby a percentage of book profit is treated as taxable profit 
So now I request you to just elaborate on this
So learners have now a wide idea about what are the
particular term, minimum alternate tax 
Definitely sir, minimum alternate tax is also called Matt 
Let's first understand how tax liability is computed under
normal provisions, and then we will understand how
it is computed under Matt 
So, computation one is under normal provisions  Under normal
provisions, we'll talk about seven steps of competition 
Step one talks about taxable income, which is arrived at under normal provisions 
Step two is a income tax that you charge at the rate of 30% 
In case it is a foreign company, then the slab is 40% 
deductions that can be claimed from the gross total income 
Step three talks about surcharge, if any has which has
to be added to the rate of 30%  Step four, talks about step two
plus step three  Next is Step five, which is HECC or Cess
which is at the rate of 4%, which we will add on step four amount 
Next is step six, which talks about the tax rebate under
Section 86, 90, 90A and 91  And finally, arrive at step seven,
which is step four, plus step five minus step six, which is the
tax which is payable and this figure can not be negative 
So under normal computation and normal provisions, we have done step seven 
So we have done from step one till step seven  Let's move to
Besides section 10 also gives some kind of exemptions which
computation under Matt  Under Matt we will start with step 8
and index step 13  Step 8 says what  It says that you have to
find the book profit under Mat  Now what is book profit 
When we make the PL for a company profit and loss account, we arrive at a
net profit, Mat list down certain additions and subtractions that
you have to do on the net profit to arrive at the book profit 
So step eight talks about arriving at the book profit
under the Mat provisions which is given in the law 
Next is step nine, which says that you have to
apply the rate of 18 5% of tax on the book
are exempted abinitio that they do not form part of gross
profit that you've arrived at step eight  Next is step 10
in which, similar to step three, you add surcharge in step 10 
Step 11 is then finding out the total amount, which is step nine
plus step 10  Step 12, here next step corresponds to step five of the normal
computation under normal provisions,
which is adding the SHEC and EC cess, which is 4% on step 11 
And then the normal provisions under step five, with added
cess on step four, similarly, here on step 12, we will add
cess at the rate 4% on step 11  After step 12 we arrive at step 13,
which is the step which is a final step for Mat computation,
total income  But once it is included in gross total income,
which is step 11 plus step 12  So, this is a computation of
tax liability under both provisions which you have to do for any company 
So while you calculating your tax liability,
you will arrive at step seven also for the same company and arrive
at step 13 for the same company  And the tax liability of that
company will be Step seven or step 13, whichever is more 
Therefore, MAT under 115JB will be applicable if the tax
liability of a company under normal provision is lower than
18 5% of the book profit  And what will be the effect of this
applicability of MAT  Effect will be that the book profit shall be
the deductions can be avail from under Section 80C to 80U 
deemed to be the total income and 18 5% of the book profit
should be deemed as the tax liability  Now, this was all
about MAT and 115JB but they're exception to MAT provisions 
Three main exceptions to MAT provision are
as follows: Number one, the income of a shipping company
subject to the provision of 'tonnage income' and not under MAT 
Number two, income which accrues and arises to a company
from life insurance business would be referred to in section
115B and not 115JB  And final in case of a foreign company,
whether its total income comprises solely of profits and
And CA Rachita Saraf has already discussed in detail the
gains referred to in Sections 44B, 44BB, 44BBA and 44BBB
those sections which applicable to a foreign
company, such cases will not be applicable to MAT  So, these
were the exceptions for Mat  Last topic under Mat is carry
forward and set of tax credit  It says that the amount of tax
which is in excess of step 13, over step seven will be carried
forward and set off in future years when tax becomes payable
under the normal provisions  Here the time limit for carry forward
of tax credit under section 115JB is 10 years, up to assessment
year 2017-18 which has been enhanced to 15 years from
various sections and learners should advise the clients as
assessment year 2018-19  I hope you understood the provisions of Mat 
This was all about Mat versus normal computation 
So, it was a very interesting discussion on a complex topic of
computation of income from companies  We have learned that
how income is computed  For companies, what are the
different provisions and what are the sections that is
deductions that can be claimed under different sections of 80C
and 80U, as well as CA Rachita Saraf has also given a
glimpse of the minimum alternate tax  That is when the tax is
charged, even if the taxable profit is zero  And she has also
well as they can also take advantage of various sections,
some of the provisions for revisions of the assessment of
assessment order by the income tax authorities  So, you
welcome CA Rajkumar Nahata, to this week discussion on appeals
and revisions  As you are in the practice for last 20 years
so you are very much conversant with the process of appeals and revisions 
But before I hand it over on discussion for appeals
and revisions, can you just give a briefing on who are
the income tax authorities that normally come into the picture
for income tax administration 
Welcome learners once again  I'm here, so
Welcome learners  Welcome to the discussion on appeals and revisions 
today we will discuss about appeals and revisions 
So appeal as we everyone know what is an appeal and we will learn
later on in details  So, income tax authorities, the apex
body is the CBDT central board of direct taxes which is formed by
the government  So the central board of direct taxes is the
apex body amongst income tax authority 
So below them we have Principal Chief Commissioner of income tax or
Principal Director General of income tax  So, then we have
Chief Commissioner of income tax or Director General of income tax 
So they are in CBDT  Then we have some CCIT or
Remember on week 10, we have learned the process of filing of return
principle CCIT or principal Director General of
income tax, say for the entire any region we have one principal
Chief Commissioner  So, likewise for northern region or region
wise we have principal CCITs or principal DGITs 
They are followed by Chief Commissioner of income tax or Director
General of income tax  So, under one Principal CCIT, there might
be 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10 CCITs, Chief commissioner of income tax 
So again, below the principal CCITs we have commission
income tax or additional Director General or Director of income tax 
So again, there they are also given different
and the assessment  We have CA Rajkumar Nahata, very nicely
charges, CIT assessment, CIT appeals or CIT administration,
CIT revenue, CIT audit, CIT and vision  
So they are given charges of different wings of the
income tax department  So then we below the Commissioners
of income tax, we have Additional Commissioner of
income tax or we also say them as Additional Director of income
tax followed by Joint Commissioner of income tax or Joint Director
of income tax  So, from Joint Commissioner of income tax,
till the line till the down the line we go they are the
assessing officers basically  The assessment part is being done by
elaborated the provisions to us  Today, we have invited him again
this category, joint Commissioner or below Joint Commissioner  So
as per the action plan, sometimes as per the action plan,
even joint commissioners, they don't go for scrutiny or they
are not allowed to do scrutiny or assessment procedures and all those things 
So their department comes out with an action plan every year 
Again, below joint commissioners, we
have deputy commissioners of income tax, or you say Deputy
Director of income tax  Then we have assistant commissioners of
income tax or assistant director of income tax 
Then we have income tax officers 
for a discussion on appeals and revisions 
So income tax officers under the and Income Tax officers
and tax recovery officers they are on the same
income tax officers and tax recovery
officers and below them we have inspectors 
So this is the complete hierarchy of income tax authorities 
Let me summarize the discussions which you have made so far 
So if I understand correctly, or if I'm wrong,
please correct me in my discussion 
So in the top there is this Central Board of
direct taxes, which is the apex authority or
Today in this week discussion, we will be learning
administration of income tax in India  Then as far as the normal
operatives are concerned, the head is the principal chief
commissioner of income tax, or principal Director General of
income tax  Next is the chief commissioner of income tax
or Director General of income tax, followed by principal
commissioner of income tax, or additional Director General or
principal director of income tax  Then comes the Commissioner
of income tax or additional Director General or director of
income tax  And then is the additional direct commissioners
of income tax or additional director of income tax 
various things on appeals made by the assessee
And as you have already told the assessing power comes from the
Joint Commissioner and down below 
There may doing assessment process  
So they are the joint commissioner of income tax or
joint director of income tax  Then comes the deputy
Commissioner of income tax or Deputy Director of income tax,
then comes the Assistant Commissioner of income tax or
assistant director of income tax, and followed by our
neighborhood officers on ITOs  Where the income tax officers
and at the same footing they are also tax recovery officers 
if he or she is not satisfied with the order of the assessing officer 
And lastly, the income tax inspectors  So this is the total
hierarchy of income tax authorities 
And at the same time we will also learn
how to minimize tax liability legally 
Welcome learners  As sarkar sir correctly said, tax planning is
the arrangement of one's financial and economic affairs
by taking complete legitimate benefits of all the deductions,
exemptions, allowances and rebates so that the tax
liability is reduced to minimum  Thus, tax planning involves
moving around the laws in a legal way and availing all the
deduction exemptions and allowances to reduce your tax liability 
Let's understand this with an example 
So, for example, for the assessment there 18, 19, the gross total
Welcome learners the last week of discussion that is tax planning 
income of a person say X is rupees 12,90,000 and tax on
12,90,00 is two lakh 5,490 rupees  To reduce his tax
liability it deposits rupees 2,50,000 in PPF account
and therefore, his taxable income and tax liability reduces to
rupees 11 lakh 40,000 and rupees 1 lakh 59,140 respectively 
Therefore, this is tax planning 
Also, when you know about tax planning
that two other concepts that you should be aware of
one is Tax Avoidance and the other Tax Evasion 
Let's start with tax evasion  What is tax evasion?
In all our previous discussions, we have tried to
Tax evasion is using all methods by which tax liablities is illegally avoided 
So tax evasion is not recommended because this is
illegal and punishable  Let me give you an example 
Suppose X has a factory in Haryana,
which manufactures chemicals 
Also he has a land of 12,000 square meter, which is unutilized
within this factory which produces chemicals  Now X wants
to start a new unit but if the unit is started in the existing
factory campus then the deduction under 80IB is not available,
because it is available only in Jammu and Kashmir 
give you certain hints or certain tips for tax planning 
Now, what does X do? Suppose he starts production in
Haryana but to claim deduction under 80 IB, it takes a factory
building on rent in Jammu Kashmir and only on paper to
show that the new unit has started in Jammu and Kashmir 
What is this learner? This is tax evasion because this is illegal 
I hope you've understood the meaning of tax evasion 
Let's move to another topic, which is tax avoidance 
What is tax avoidance? It is reducing or negating tax
liability in a legally permissible way and has legal sanction 
It is not tax evasion, but we never recommend tax avoidance
Tax planning is the way to minimize the tax liability of an assessee legally 
we always recommend tax planning  Now an example to
go for tax avoidance is this  Suppose 50,000 is gifted by
husband to wife, then the clubbing provisions are applicable
under Section 64(1), this section is not
applicable, if it is made by the same person out of the funds of
his HUF in the capacity as a karta of the family 
Therefore, if the gift is made by the karta of the family to his wife,
the provisions are not applicable and can be avoided
and tax liability will be reduced  This is not illegal
and hence it is tax avoidance  I am repeating this again, learners,
Today we have invited CA Rachita Saraf
you should always go for tax planning and not for tax
avoidance or tax evasion 
Thank you for making clear the concepts of tax evasion, tax
avoidance tax planning  So tax evasion is completely a now
no affair where is tax avoidance should not be encouraged 
But tax planning is a good way to minimize the things 
So the process of tax planning can started from the very beginning,
even when a new business unit is set up,
before setting up or selecting the location etc, the enterpreneur
or the promoters can think for the tax planning 
again for a discussion because she is a practicing chartered
Can you highlight some of the issues in these that how a business firm
or an entrepreneur or an assessee can think for tax planning in the
beginning of setting up of a business 
Definitely sir, for tax planning with reference to
setting up of new business you have to consider three main things 
One is the location of the new business 
Second is the nature of the new business
and form of organization of the new business 
accountant and she can tell us the legal ways to minimize tax liability 
So we welcome you, madam thank you, and just request
you to tell us certain tips about the tax planning
of a capital asset effected in the previous year will be
chargeable to tax under the head capital gains' 
Such capital gains will be deemed to be the income of the previous year
in which the transfer takes place  So, any profit or gains arising
from transfer of a capital asset during the previous year is
chargeable to tax under the head "CAPITAL GAINS" immediately
following the assessment year  , this will be taxable if
such gains is not exempted or not eligible for exemption under
, if we analyze section 45,
Welcome learners  Welcome to the discussion of capital gains 
then we will find that there are five conditions 
Condition number one, that there should be a capital asset 
condition number two, the capital asset is TRANSFERRED by the Assessee,
condition number three such transfer takes place DURING the previous year 
condition number four, any PROFIT or GAIN arises as a result of transfer 
,mind it the term PROFIT or GAIN also includes negative profit or
gain or in other words it is loss, and condition number five
such profit or gain is not exempt under Section 54,54B, 54D,
five conditions, which must be fulfilled for any income to come
This week we'll be learning section 45 to Section 55 of the
under the head capital gains will we see one by one,
that the important term is capital asset and second important term is Transferred 
what is a capital asset?
According to section 2(14), a capital asset means
(a) property of any kind held by an assessee, whether or not connected with
his business or profession; or secondly,Any securities held
by foreign Institutional investors which has invested in
such securities in accordance with the SEBI regulation 
To make it more clear CAPITAL ASSET does NOT include number one
stock- in trade: that is any stock in trade, other than the
Income Tax Act, which deals with the head of income capital gains 
securities which we have already discussed or consumable stores
or raw materials held for the purpose of business or
profession of the assessee; And secondly, personnel effects,
personnel effect that is to say, movable property, such as
including wearing apparel and furniture held for personal use
by the asseessee or any member of his family dependent on him 
But remember, Archaeological collections, Drawings,
Paintings, Sculpture; or any work of art, even if these are
personnel effects, these will be treated as capital asset
and transfer of such assets will attract capital gains tax 
When the assessee earns income by way of transfer of a
Capital gain asset does not include Rural agricultural land
that is agricultural land in India i e , which is not situated in
any of the specified area  That is the population of 10,000 or
more or it is in a cantonment board or municipal area
and also capital asset will not include specified Gold Bonds,
six and a half percent Gold Bonds, 1977, or 7% Gold Bonds, 1980, National
Defence gold bonds, 1980, issued by central government;
special Bearer Bonds, 1991 issued by the central government;
and also capital asset will not include Gold Deposit Bonds
issued under the Gold Deposit Scheme, 1999 or deposit
capital asset, then the gains or loss is chargeable under the
certificate under the Gold Monetization Scheme, 2015
notified by Central Government  otherwise, all assets will be
treated as capital assets  so, Repeat capital asset includes
almost all assets all property, but which is held by the assessee 
Whether or not connected with business or
professional including securities, but will not include
stock in trade, will not include personnel effects, will not
include rural agricultural land and will not include specified
gold bonds or gold deposit bonds 
head capital gains  So we will devote this session on learning
how income tax is charged on capital gains  Section 45 of the
Income Tax Act deals with chargeability section 45
provides that any profits or gains arising from the transfer
, the important term is that capital assets
more than 36 months, it will be treated as long term capital asset 
However, a security other than a unit listed in a recognized
stock exchange or a unit of equity oriented fund or a unit
of unit Trust of India or a zero coupon bond will be considered
as a long term capital asset if the same is held for more than
12 months immediately preceding the previous year
or the year of its transfer  That means, in case of other assets it is 36 months,
in case of listed equity shares or listed security or unit it is 12 months 
Now, period of holding of unlisted share to
qualify as a long term capital asset is that a share of a
it can be categorized or classified under two heads,
company not being a share listed in a recognized Stock Exchange
would be treated as short term capital asset, if it was held by
an assessee for not more than 24 months immediately preceeding the
date of its transfer  Thus, the period of holding of such
unlisted shares for being treated as long term capital asset would
be more than 24 months instead of 36 months or in case of
listed it is 12 months  , there is another change from the
assessment year 2018- 19 that period of holding of an
immovable property, being land or building or both 
, an immovable property being land or building or both would be
short term capital asset and long term capital asset  Section2(42A)
treated as a short term capital asset if it was held by an
assessee for not more than 24 months, immediately preceeding
the date of its transfer  Thus, the period of holding of
immovable property, being land or building or both, for being
treated as a long term capital asset has been reduced from More
than 36 months to more than 24 months from assessment year 2018-19 
, what do we get is that there are for short term
and long term the cutoff is 36 months that is normally an asset,
if it is held for more than 36 months, it would be treated as
long term capital asset, otherwise it is treated as short
defines short term capital asset as a asset held by an
term capital asset   with the exception of
listed securities, where instead of 36 months, it is 12 months,
for unlisted securities, instead of 36 months, it is 24 months 
And in case of immovable property, instead of 36 months,
it would be 24 months  , let's see the meaning of transfer 
Section2(47) defines transfer
in relation to a capital asset which includes different types of transactions 
It includes the sale, exchange or
relinquishment of the rights in the assets
of extinguishment of any rights or the compulsory acquisition
assessee not more than 36 months immediately preceeding the date of its transfer 
thereof under any law
convert the same into stock in trade into a business  In case of
a maturity or Redemption of a zero coupon bond
, in this way, all this definition or all these
transactions will be treated as transferred 
, in case of section 45 deals the scope of and the year of chargeability 
There are certain provisions, there are
certain insurance receipts, conversion of treatment of
capital gains, etc  treated as, it comes under this Scope of that particular asset section 
Therefore, a capital asset held by an Assessee for
, in case of capital gains, there are
certain specific cases that is capital gains in case of
distribution of assets by company in liquidation,
capital gains in case of buyback of shares  , in all these cases,
the transactions of transfer has certain,
typical characteristics, please read the study materials the e-text,
where we will be discussing this particular points in detail 
more than 36 months, immediately preceeding the date of its transfer,
is a long term capital asset  , the cut off date is 36 months 
, up to 36 months, if the asset is held, it would be
treated as short term capital asset, but if it is held for
coming to Section 48 that is the mode of computation of capital gains 
number b) cost of acquisition number c) cost of improvement 
, from full value of consideration, we will deduct three things
number one, expenditure on transfer,
number two cost of acquisition, number three cost of improvement 
, from resulting figure, we will deduct exemption provided
under various sections of 54  Normally four sections are
available for short term capital gains, these are section 54B,
54D, 54G and 54GA  , when from the resultant sum, we
deduct these four sections, the deductions available under these
four sections, we will get the balancing amount as short term capital gain 
Section 48 of the Income Tax Act discusses the
In case of long term capital gain the process is
almost same with some minor difference  We have to find out
the full value of consideration, will deduct just like in case of
short term three things here also three number a)
expenditure incurred wholly or exclusively in connection with such transfer 
Number b) instead of simple cost of acquisition 
We'll be using indexed cost of acquisition
number c) indexed cost of improvement 
from the result and figure, we'll be giving the deductions
or exemptions available under Section 54  Instead of four here
mode of computation  The first criterion is the
seven sections are available section 54,54B, 54D, 54EC, 54G,
54GA and 54GB  , when these are deducted, these
exemptions are deducted from resultant figure, we get long
term capital gain  , the difference between short term
capital asset and long term capital asset when the tax is
being computed or capital gain is computed in case of short
term capital gain only the simple cost of acquisition
and cost of improvement is deducted  But in case of long term capital
gain indexed cost of acquisition and indexed cost of improvement
is given as deduction  , in case of long term capital asset
whether the asset is a short term capital asset or long term capital assets 
we get the benefit of indexation, that is the cost of
acquisition and cost of improvement is a bit inflated
or more deductions are given because we use the index 
However, this indexation benefit are not available in some of the
cases, there are many cases where this indexation benefit is
not available  we can only mention here one that is a
depreciable asset, that is, if in any asset depreciation
benefit is being taken by the business over the years,
in that case, that particular asset cannot have indexation benefit 
, capital gains tax are also exempt under Section 10 and
, it depends on the nature of capital asset
under Section 115, 115JG  , these deductions may be referred
to in particular sections  regarding the inflation,
That is the indexation of the cost of acquisition and cost of improvement 
The income tax Act has taken 2001-02 as the base year
and accordingly the cost inflation index is provided
under the Income Tax Act, where the CII that is the cost
inflation index is provided from 2001-02 to the financial year
2018-19, while the CII is 100 in for the financial year 2001-02
it is 280 for 2018-19 
, let's see computation of capital gain
transfer  in case of short term capital asset, the rule is that
in certain special cases, that is conversion of capital asset
into stock-in-trade  Computation of capital gains on transfer of
firm's assets to partners and vice versa 
compulsory acquisition of an asset in case of non resident in case of self
generated assets, in case of distribution of assets of
companies on liquidation, conversion of debentures into
shares, transfer of security into demat forms, insurance claims received,
purchased by a company of its own shares or securities,
transport of stock option or sweat equity 
, all these are very interesting cases where we
we have to find out the sale consideration first 
the computition of capital gain is very interesting 
Out of these two we'll be discussing a bit in detail 
One is the bonus shares 
That is the shares which are given to the shareholders free of cost 
If the bonus shares are acquired before first of April, 2001
then we are to take the fair market value of 2001
on first of April 2001 as the cost  But if the bonus shares are
acquired on After first of April 2001, then cost of acquisition
will be taken as zero  , the entire bonus shares, if these
have transferred, the sell consideration will be taken as
from the sale consideration, we have to deduct
capital gain  Same to same in case of right shares 
Right shares are those shares, which are given to the existing
shareholders at a lower cost  , if the right shares are
sold, in that case, we will calculate the sale consideration
and the original shares as the amount actually paid 
If the Assessee has sold the rights entitlement,
then the cost of acquisition of rights entitlement will be taken as Nil
when these rights shares are sold, then the
amount actually paid for right shares will be taken as cost of acquisition 
If we say from the other angle, that is the right
number a) expenditure incurred wholly
shares purchased by the person in whose favour the right
entitlement has been renounced for him or her 
The purchase price paid to the announcer plus
the amount paid to the company will be the cost of acquisition 
We will discuss a problem and an example
whereby this concept will be made clear to you 
or exclusively in connection with such transfer
Let us discuss problems on bonus shares, and rights shares 
hands of Mr  Y  cost inflation index for 2001-02 is given hundreed
and 2017-18 is given as 272 
Let us now compute the capital gains in the hands of
Mr  X for the assessment year 2018-19 
So, there is 1000 original shares,
which are sold at rupees 300 per share 1000 is three lakh rupees,
we get indexed cost of acquisition, because these
shares already qualify for 24 months holding  , it is indexed
cost 272 by 100 of 75,000  This cost is becoming 2,04,000
, we get the long term capital gain of 96,000
bonus share is to be taken as the fair market value as on first of April 2001 
from the sale of 1000 original shares 
Regarding 200 right shares, which were given
in the month of August 2017  , which has not been
hold for more than 24 months  Mind it
this company is a unlisted company 
, to be eligible for long term capital asset,
the shares must be held for a minimum period of 24
months, which is not qualified here  , here indexed cost of
acquisition will not be allowed  The sale proceeds of 200 shares
into rupees three hundreed 60,000 simple cost of acquisition of
And if bonus shares are received by the shareholders
rupees 116 into 200 is 32,000  , you get a short term capital gain of
rupees 28,000  same will be the case of sale of right
entitlement which is another kind of gain to him Sale
proceeds at the rate of rupees 34 for 200 rights entitlement is
6000 rupees  cost of acquisition is taken as NIL in such cases 
, short term capital gain here also is rupees 6000 
, total capital gain of Mr X from 1000 original shares from 200 rights
shares and sale of right entitlement is rupees 96,000
long term capital gain and rupees 28,000 and 6,000 is short
term capital gain  , 96,000 is long term capital gain, while
after first of April 2001, then the cost of acquisition will be taken as nill
34,000 is short term capital gain  , we have already told
you that since the holding period of these shares is less
than 24 months, they are short term capital assets  Hence cost
of acquisition will not be indexed  The cost of rights
renounced in favor of another person for the consideration is
taken to be NIL  The consideration so received is
taxed at short-term capital gain in full  The period of holding is
taken from the date of rights offered to the date of renouncement 
, let's see the computation of capital gains in
the hands of Mr  Y for the assesment year 2018-19 
in case of right shares 
Mr  Y is who purchased the right entitlement from Mr  X 
, for 200 shares, that is Mr  X has sold the shares and the sale
proceeds which he gets is 200 into 280 is rupees 56,000 
, Mr  X, Mr  Y is getting 56,000 as sale proceeds 
Cost of acquisition for 200 shares is that rupees 30 was paid to Mr  X
as right entitlement and rupees 160 is paid to the company  ,
total is 190 per shares  , 190 into 200 shares is 38,000 
, in this case also is unlisted shares  , short term capital
gain will be rupees 18,000  , since the cost of rights is the
amount paid to paid by Mr  Y as well as the amount paid to the company 
The cost of acquisition will be the amount paid
since the holding period of these shares is less than 24 months,
They are short term capital assets 
by the shareholder to the company against the right shares 
In case of right shares, the existing shareholder has got
an option to renounce the rights  renouncing the rights
means that the right shares are sold to some other person for a
price, then that renouncing amount is also a gain for the existing shareholder 
Before I go to the problems, let us clear the concepts of bonus
, let me discuss one problem on bonus shares 
Ms Asha purchases 1,000 equity shares in x Ltd ,
at a cost of rupees 30 per share brokerage 1% and she
purchased it in January 1996 She gets hundred bonus shares
in August 2000, she again gets 1100 bonus shares by virtue of
her holding on February 2006  Fair market value of the shares of X Ltd 
on april 1 2001 is rupees 80 
In January 2018 she transfers all shares at rupees
200 per share, brokerage paid 2%  , we have to compute the
capital gains taxable in the hands of Ms  Asha
shares as well as rights shares  Bonus shares are those shares,
for the assessment year 2018-19  Given the cost inflation index for
financial year 2001-02 as hundreed financial year 2005-06 as 117
and financial year 2017-18 as 272 
Let us go to the solution  If we see the problem,
then we'll find that original shares were purchased in 1996
in January 1996 and Ms  Asha got hundred bonus shares in
August 2000, 1100 bonus shares in February 2006  And the question
says that she transfers all the shares in January 2018 
if we see at this moment, Asha has got 1000 original shares
and 1100 bonus shares  Out of 1100 bonus shares hundred Bonus shares were
which are given by a company to its existing shareholders free of cost 
received prior first of April 2001 and 1100 bonus shares were
received after first of April 2001 
, we have to calculate the capital gains under different heads 
will first see the gains or loss for 1000 original shares
for sale proceeds of 1000 original shares,
she sold it for rupees 200 per share,so it is two lakh rupees,
brokerage paid is 2% that is 2% of rupees two lakh it is 4000 
Net sale consideration therefore, is 1,96,000 
, it's the listed company shares  , 12 months holding
will be sufficient to get the eligibility for long term capital asset 
While Right shares are those shares, which are given to
In case of long term capital asset indexation
benefit can be claimed  , thus the indexed cost of
acquisition will be deducted  indexed cost of acquisition is 272 by 100 
And it's cost of acquisition was 80 per share, it is 1000 
, rupees 80 into 1000 number of shares into CII that is the
cost of inflation index 272 by 100  , the cost of acquisition when
we indexed it, it becomes 2,17,600  , when we deduct
it from the net sale consideration,
we get long term capital loss of 21,600 
This is for the 1000 original shares  Regarding hundred bonus
the existing shareholders, not free, but at a price which is a
shares we have to calculate it separately because the one first
of April 2001 is the cutoff date  Hundred bonus shares were
received prior first of April 2001  The sale proceeds of 100
bonus shares at the rate of rupees 200 is 20,000 
brokerage rupees 400  , Net sale consideration is 19,600 
Indexed cost of acquisition will be rupees 100
that is the fair market value on first of April 2001
into rupees 80 is the fair market value
on first of April 2001 and hundred is the number of shares 
, rupees 80 into hundred into cost of acquisition
bit lower than the market price  , in both the cases,
272 by 100 we get cost of acquisition as 21,760 
, you get long term capital loss of rupees 2160 from 100 bonus shares 
Regarding 1100 bonus shares which were received
after first of April 2001, sale proceeds is rupees 200
per share  , 1,100 is 2,20,000 ,brokerage is rupees 4,400 
, our Net sale consideration is 2,15,600 
Here the cost of acquisition will be taken as Nill 
, the entire net sale consideration of rupees 2,15,600
is to be taken as long term capital gain 
, if we calculate the total the
the existing shareholders get benefit from the company  In case
income from capital gains, so, the long term capital gain,
there was a loss in A loss in B, but there is a capital gain is C 
, ultimately it would be 1,91,840 
there is a A there was a loss from sale of 1000 original
shares of 21,600  there is a loss of hundred bonus shares,
that is 2160 but there was a capital gain of rupees 2,15,600
from 1100 bonus shares  , ultimately the long term capital
gain will be rupees 1,91,840 
Let's see another problem on right shares
Mr  X holds 1000 shares in Star Ltd , which is an unlisted
of bonus shares, the income tax rule says that if the bonus
company, which is acquired in the year 2001-02 at a cost of rupees 75,000 He
has been offered right shares by the company in
the month of August 2017 at rupees 160 per share in the
ratio of two for every five shares held  He retains 50% of
the rights and renounces the balance right shares in favor of
another person Mr  Y for rupees 30 per share in September
2017  All the shares are sold by Mr  X for rupees 300 per share
in January 2018 and Mr  Y sells his shares in December
2017 at rupees 280 per share  we have to calculate the
capital gains taxable in the hands of Mr  X as well as in the
shares are issued prior first of April 2001, then the cost of
Hello learners, we have seen many discussions on capital gains 
Budget 2019 has announced something special and I thought
that let we take this to you  One is that the assessee can
get an exemption by investing long term capital gains from the
sale of house property in up to two house properties
against the earlier provision of investment of
only one house property with same conditions 
So, now remember, instead of one house property
you are getting 2 house property, though the
conditions are same  However, the capital gains on the sale of
house property must not exceed rupees two crores 
And I thought that let me end with some important facts 
So, I thought that before we end the discussion on capital gains,
you must know the latest amendment which has been brought by
the budget 2019 and applicable for the future assessment  
Now, before ending again I want to make a recap on
the identification of long term and short term capital asset
because the majority of the tax implications will depend on
whether the asset is a short term capital asset or a long
term capital asset  As you can see under different categories
of assets, we have immovable property listed equity shares,
unlisted shares, equity mutual fund, Dept mutual fund
As you know that capital gains attracts huge amount of tax
and other assets  In case of immovable property,
the cutoff time is 24 months  That means, if you can hold an immovable
property for a period of 24 months and more, it will qualify
for long term capital asset, but if the holding is up to 24 months,
then it is short term capital asset  So, in long term
capital asset, you can get some kind of tax benefits  In case of
listed equity shares it is 12 months not 24 months 
So, 12 months a listed equity share if it is hold for a period of
more than 12 months, it will qualify as long term capital asset 
Unlisted shares, if it is not listedlisted 12
because the gains itself sometimes is used  So that's why
months in case of unlisted shares, it is 24 months 
So, 24 months is the cutoff for unlisted shares like listed
equity shares, equity mutual funds are also 12 months 
So,each mutual funds you hold it for 12 months or more,
it will qualify as long term capital asset
and the long term capital gain tax will be applicable as per the roll 
Depth mutual fund  There is a difference
here it is 36 months not 12 months 
Depth mutual fund is 36 months  36 months required more than
36 month required the period of holding for making it
we should take every care to see that the tax compliance is
long term capital asset  And in case of all other assets,
it is the period of 36 months or three years 
So, just remember the different categories of assets 
So that you can see that whether
the asset qualifies for long term capital assets 
So I thought that it has been important for me to discuss this
before I end the discussion on capital gains 
Thank you 
properly done, you pay the required amount of tax as
calculated under different sections of the Act 
And at the same time, I would also say
that you take all the benefits which are given
under the Act, the exemptions you should take 
Hello learners, we think that discussions on some problems
From here he has will get the deduction of bank charges
which is being charged 642  So, amount taxable under the head income
from other sources is 33,773  Income from House property there
is a rental income is 12,00,000 So, his gross total
income coming as 12,33,773  No information
reduction is given to us  So, his total income or net income is 12,33,773 
So, in case of government securities tax is
not deductible at source on 193  So, we have adjusted the income
in case of non listed securities tax is deducted at
source at 10%  Therefore, the amount realized in cash of
agricultural income from Nepal rupees 25,000; then he has earned
debentures of XYZ Limited is 2,880  It is calculated as 3,200
minus 10% of 3,200  Interest on tax free relief bond is exempted
under Section 10(15) and hence it is not taxable 
Now, let's see the last problem for this episode is problem number 4 
P holds the following securities on April 1, 2017 
7% government loan, date of payment of interest is July
15 every year
limited, Date of payment of interest is June 30 every year;
additional information P invest in two other government role and
receives rupees on December 1, 2017 rupees 36,000 and rupees
some interest from bank every year 10,800;
19,000 respectively  He also invest in the debentures of PQR
limited and December interest of rupees one lakh that is rate of
taxes 10% being deducted, he pays 6000 as commission to his
bank for collecting interest on securitie , his business income
is 24,32,000  So, find out the taxable income of P for the
assessment year 2018-19  Solution is almost same as Problem number 3 
So, debentures of ABC Limited is earning an interest
of 41,800; government loan 30,100; other government loan 36,000 in
loan one; loan two it is 90,000; Debentures of PQ are limited 
He has received 1,08,000 but there is a deduction of tax
on post office savings bank account 2000
of 10% of the gross amount will be 1,20,000 
So, total is calculated as 3,17,900  From here he will get the
deduction for the expenses of commission that is paid to bank 6,000 
So, amount taxable under the head income from other sources
comes as 3,11,900  He has a business income of 24,32,000 
So, his gross total income is 27,43,900 
No information of deduction is given to us and as such is net
income will be 27,43,900  Through these problems four
problems and solutions, we have tried to give you some kind of
idea about how income tax is calculated under this particular
on public provident fund account 5500
head income from other sources 
Thank you
certificates 2500
10,000; Lottery prize received after T D S tax deduction at source
28,000; and rain from subletting of a flat rent paid
to landlord was 6000; but it is rent is 15,000 he has got from his  
Now let's see the solutions to the problem 
So again I am repeating the question, directors meeting fees
and solutions on income from other sources,
received from Z limited
agriculture income from Nepal
then he has earned some interest from Bank FDR
Savings Bank
National Savings certificate
company
and also he has got some rain for subletting  So, these are major
components of income from other sources  Director meeting fee
3500 will come under the income from other sources
income, the agricultural land is situated in India is exempted under Section 10
will clarify the concepts in an elaborate way 
so, it will not come, but agriculture income from Nepal will come
25,000; interest on fixed deposit is given as made
So, we have to get that gross which comes as 12,000 rupees;
government securities interest is taxable 1000
NSC interest is taxable 2500
of 28000 but actual income is 40,000; rent received
this 12,000 from but from 12,000 he has paid expenses of
6000 so 6000 is taxable  So the if we get the total, total come
says rupees 90,000 which is the computation of income under the
head income from other sources 
So, we will be discussing four problems and solutions in this episode 
Let's see before going to the problem number 2  So just
the of problem number 1 agriculture to income from land
situated in India is exempted  Interest on post office savings
account bank account is exempt up to 3500  Interest earned from
PPF is fully exempted
under Section 10 of the Act 
Let's see question number 2 Problem number 2 
M has the following securities on April 1, 2017  6% debentures of
PQ are limited data payment of interest is June 11 and
December 11 every year So, it is 35,000; 5% government
Let's see Problem number one, where is told that
loan date of payment of interest is January 1 it is 11 lakh
50,000; 8% debentures of ABC limited date of payment of
interest is june 15 and February 15 every year, it is 25,000;
additional information on December 1, 2017 M sells rupees
25,000, 8% debentures of ABC limited, his business income for
the year is rupees five lakhs
Punjab National Bank interest is around rupees 10,000;
he has received a gift of rupees one lakh in foreign currency
from a friend in December 2001-2017 on his marriage anniversary,
and post office savings bank interest that he is earned is 4000 
compute the income from other sources of Mr Z,
So, from these incomes which are being given we
have to calculate the taxable income in the hands of M for
the assessment year 2018-19  Let's see the solutions to
problem number 2  Debentures in PQR limited the
interest which is earned 2100, two times has got the interest;
government loan the interest 57,500; in case of dventures in
ABC Limited is on 1000 rupees
10,000; gift is taxable 1000; post office savings bank account 500
will be taxable because 3500 is exempted  So, amount taxable
under the head income from other sources comes as 1,71,100 
who submits the following particulars for the assessment year 2019-20 
Business income is taxable under the profits and gains of
business or profession and which is five lakhs  So gross total
income is coming at rupees 6,71,100  As he has
earned some income from Bank interest, so he is eligible to
claim deduction under Section 80-TTA, where interest on post office
bank account 500 and PNB interest is 10,000; total comes
to 10,500 but the maximum limit is given under Section 80-TTA
is 10,000  So, he can claim up to rupees 10,000  So, his total
income after deduction of deductions under Section 80-TTA
come as 6,61,100  This is problem number 2 
These amounts are given in rupees 
Let's see Problem number three 
The following are the securities held by Q on April one 2017 
8% non listed debentures of XYZ limited, date of payment also
twice in a year may 15, and November 15 is 40,000
investment; 6 5% central government loan which is 11,000;
8% tax relief bonds 50,000; additional information being
provided, Q invests in other two government loans and receives
interest amounting to rupees 3500 and rupees 7000
respectively on December 1, 2017  Another investment in
non-listed Debenture of ABC limited and received rupees 18,000
Directors meeting fees received from Z limited 3500
as interest on December 31, 2017; payment to bank as commission
for collecting interest as net is 2%
lakhs that is income from House property  So, we have to
calculate the taxable income of Q for the assessment year 2018-19 
Let's see the solutions to the problem number 3 
So debentures amount received in cash and amount taxable 
So debentures in XYZ limited amount taxable is 3200
that is the loan is earning 715; other government loan 3500, loan two
7000; Debentures of ABC Limited is 20,000 is the taxable amount
because they received the net amount of 18,000  So, total is 34,415 
agricultural income from land situated in India rupees 15,000;
Hello learners, after discussing various issues of deductions
the royalty, which is being done from postgraduate course by Mrs 
A it's 74,400  So, net income after deductions of all
these things come as 6,75,100 for A, 6,80,000 and 11,55,000 
So, income tax on net income 49,520, B 46,000, C
1,46,500  There is no surcharges  Tax and surcharges
comes to 49,520, 46,000, 1,46,500 
We add education cess and then secondary cess and
ultimately we get the tax payable for A 51,010, 47,380 and
1,50,900  So, in this way we can calculate the things
under check Problem No  2  So here the difference is normal
major daughter (policy taken on 1 4 2014)
age, senior age and super senior age, how deductions are being
calculated 
Let's see Problem No 3 
(Assured value Rs 1,81,000) they paid the premium of Rs 
21,000  Medical insurance premium for self-
Rs  11,80,000
and for spouse it is Rs  14,200  Medical insurance premium
for self is rupees 11,800 and for spouse is 14,200  Donations to a
public charitable institution registered under 80G Rs  1,50,000
by way of cheque  LIC pension fund has contributed
Rs  58,900  Donation to National Children Fund Rs 
24,000 by way of cheque  Donation to Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund
from gross total income, let us discuss some of the problems and
Rs  23,500 by way of cheque  Donation to approve institution
for promotion of family planning Rs  39,500 by way of cheque 
So, we have to calculate the total income of Mr  Y for the
assessment year
2018-19 
So, what will do  We will see the gross total income and from
the gross total income we will try to deduct the deductions
which are eligible under different sections spreading
from 80C to 80U  Now solutions to this problem
No 1  Gross total income was given as 7,73,900 
solutions to make the concept more clear  So, now, I will move
The first we get the deduction under Section 80C 
80C deductions are life insurance premium paid for insurance
of major daughter that is maximum 10% of the assured value
is eligible  So, 1,81,000 is the policy value  So 18,100
deduction under Section 80CCC in respect of LIC pension fund
is 58,900  So, total is 77,000  So, here he could have taken up
to Rs 1,50,000  Deduction under Section 80D and
which is the medical insurance premium in respect of
self and spouse both eligible  So, 26,000 deduction under
Section 80G  80G deduction there are a year's worth 89,045
to four problems along with solutions  Listen to these
but let me show you how it is being calculated  So, this is the
working note for computation of deduction has given national
children fund 24,000 it is 100% eligible, so, deduction will be
given 24,000 Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund 23,500 percentage
of deduction here is 50%  So, eligible deduction is 11,750 
Approved institution for promotion of family planning, it
is 39,500 it is 100% subject to a qualifying limit, but it
not cross the limit, so 39,500  And public charitable trust it
is 1,50,000 here also 50% subject to qualifying limit 50%
happens to be 75,000 but there is a qualifying limit and the
problems and learn the problems very minutely so that the
qualifying limit is shown here that adjusted total income is
Err:509
Section 80C to 80U except under Section 80G that is
Rs  6,70,900 in this case Rs  67,090 being that
10% of adjusted total income is the qualifying limit  So, this
is the amount the firstly donation of Rs  39,500 to
Approved Institution
subject to qualifying limit has to be adjusted against
this amount  Thereafter donation to Public Charitable Trust
qualifying for 50% deduction subject to qualifying limit is
concept is clear to you  Now, the question number one that we
adjusted as the contribution of Rs  1,50,000 to Public
Charitable Trust is restricted to Rs  27,590 (being 67,090
-Rs  39,500) 50% of which would be the deduction under Section 80G 
Therefore, the deduction under Section 80G in respect of
donation to Public Charitable Trust will be Rs  13,795
being 50% of Rs  27,590  So, that's why Public Charitable
Trust it is given as 13,795  So, total deduction under section
80G is 89,045  So, here, deductions under Section 80G is
think that this problem gives us an overall idea about the
want to show to you, Mr  Y aged 61 years has gross total income
deduction under section 80C, 80CCC, 80D as well as 80G 
Now, let's move to question No  Problem No 2  Find
out the tax liability in the following cases for the
business of dealing in equity shares, income computed after
deducting securities transaction tax Rs  18,750 is 31,000 per
person 1, person 2 is a senior person and C is the
super senior person of 88 years, is a normal 42 years below age
60 years of age  She is the senior person of 65 years and
C is the super senior person of 88 years  Income from
of Rs 7,73,900 comprising of income from salary
royalty of textbook for postgraduate course 74,400,
income from profession of acting in two cases they are earning
this, bank interest super senior person is earning 5250,
lottery winning Mrs  A earning 20,000 other income then
comes the gross total income of Mrs  A is 9,00000, B is 7,25,000
C is to 12,00000 because other income is
10,00000  Then contribution to public provident fund iis
1,20,000, 3,000 and 15,000, life insurance premium it is Less
than the 10% of sum assured so 10,500, 15,000, 45,000  Mediclaim
insurance premium on own life 20,000 and 32000, expenditure on
and house property  He has made following payments and
mediclaim treatment no medical insurance premium paid is
40,000  So, this is the problem we are having this is the
question No  2 giving the situation of three persons
one is the normal age of below 60 years and another is senior
age 65 years and super senior age of 88 years  Now let's see
how this has been done solution  Gross total income Mrs  A is
9,00000 B is 7,25,000 C is 12,00000  Deductions under
various sections 80C it is 80C to 80U  Deduction under
80C 1,30,500, 15,000 and 45,000, under Section
80D 20,000, 30,000  So, Under Section 80QQB in respect of
investment: Number 1  premium paid to ensure the life of her
Let us continue with the further two problems  While we will do
gift of kitchen appliances by employer (cost to employer
13,400), pension from a former employer, its   it is
1,76,800, house rent allowance is 1,00,000, rent paid
in Delhi 90,000, profits and gains of newly set up
undertaking in Jammu & Kashmir it's 1,34,000,
profit from publication of books 1,40,000, income from
royalty on final accounts a book written by X in hindi and
recommendations by the Rajasthan University (gross amount is
17,000 expenses is 5000)  So, he has received 12,000  Interest
on post office bank account 15,500, profits from business of
Problem No 3 and question No 4  Question No 3, Mr 
dealing in equity shares on which securities transaction tax
18,760 is paid and the profit is calculated after deducting
securities transaction tax of 18,760 is 35,000  Profits from
business of growing mushrooms, 2,28,000, profits from
export of Goods outside India 3,21,000, income from
royalty on payments is 13,000  So he has got variety of income
and as well as one payment let's see how it is being done  So
here to determine the net income and tax there on of Mr  X for
the assessment year 2018-19 giving all permissible deductions  Now
solutions to Problem No 3  Income from salary is a
A submits the following information for the year 2018-19 
basic salary, project allowance, house high cost of living
allowance, commission, gift of kitchen appliances, in case of
house rent allowance he he will be get in some exemption under Section
10(13A) which is given a note No 1 and which we'll see
that exemption in case of house rent allowance is the least of
the following  That is actual house rent allowance received 
Than excess of rent paid over 10% salary  Salary is
already calculated of 3,48,600  So, 55,140 and 15% of
salary is 1,74,300  Out of this 3 Rs  55,140 being the
least and is therefore, exempt from tax  So, this is the
Payments, insurance premium on life insurance policy on the
deductions under from the gross house rent allowance, then pension
and gross salary is 7,97,060  And then we will see the
profits and gains of business and profession newly set up
industrial undertaking, publication of book, profit from
dealing in equity shares, export of goods, royalty on payments,
growing of mushrooms  So, income from other sources is 8,77,000
interest on post office bank deposit is 12,000 and
royalty on book an expenses 5000  So, it is ultimately 12000
plus 12,000, 24,000  So gross total income comes to 6,98,060 
Now see the deductions under Section 80C to 80U  Under
life of Mrs  X  Policy was taken in 2004 by the Hindu undivided
Section 80C, the life insurance premium is one lakh 30,000 under
section 80IB in respect of newly set up industrial
undertaking, provided we're assuming that they are satisfied
all the conditions  So 33,500 under Section 80QQB in
respect of royalty ,12,000 under Section 80RRB in respect of
regulatory on payments, 13,000 under Section 80TT in respect
of interest received from post office savings bank account is
eligible to get 10,000  So total deduction under Section 80C to 80U
is 1,98,500  Net income is 14,99,560  We
can calculate the tax as per applicable rate  It comes to 2,62,368
family of X and some assured is Rs  8,20,000  So, X
and then there is education cess of 5247 plus 2624 and the
tax liability will be rounded off at 2,70,240  So this
is a comprehensive problem giving salaries as well as
income from other sources  Now the last one question No 4 
Two partners P and Q are in the ratio of 3:2 of
a firm at Delhi  They provided the following information for
the year ending 2018  Long term capital gains in respect of
preference shares 10,000; profit from newly set up industrial
undertaking in Ladakh, production commenced during the
year 2001-02, 2,25,000; profits and gains from business
paid Rs  1,30,000  And the income, basic salary
of export of telecast rights 1,40,000; profits and
gains from export of machines to Maldives 2,40,000;
winnings from lottery 50,000; gifts received by the firm from
A on December 1, 2017 2,20,000; the firm makes the
following expenditures not deducted from the aforesaid
income
10,000; interest on money borrowed for payment of income
tax is 6500  So, you had to determine the net income of the
firm for the assessment year 2018-19  So, just have a look on
the problem  It is a comprehensive one getting
2,88,600, project allowance 1,06,000, high cost of living
different kinds of income  Now solutions
up industrial undertaking 2,25,000; profit from export of
telecast rights 1,40,000; profit from export of machines
2,40,000; capital gains 10,000; income from other sources
are winning from lottery as well as gift  So gross total income is
8,85,000  So, from 8,85,000 deductions under Section
80C to 80U are available  So under Section 18G in respect of
donation to prime minister's national relief fund cash donation exceeding
rupees 2000 is not deductible  So, he is not eligible under
Section 80IB for newly set up industrial undertaking 10 year
allowance 1,12,400, commission which has received (1% on
limit has already expired  So, nothing is allowable  So, net
income is 8,85,000  So, this is a tricky one  In solution
No 4  we will be trying to provide you this in printed
form so that you can have a look on this kind of things in our
particular site  And we hope that we will do other problems
and solutions also to make yourself clear about the chapter
deductions from gross total income  Thank you 
turnover, turnover achieved by X is Rs  60,00,000) So 60,000,
Welcome learners,
A's minor son of shares in a foreign company worth rupees
50,000 owned by him  This is an example  So, the income of the
assets transferred would be assessed in the hands of the
deemed transferor if the transferor are so intimately
connected as to form part of a single transaction, and each
transferor constitutes consideration for the other by
being mutual or otherwise  So be cautious about cross tranferor
also  Section 64(2) deals with conversion of self
acquired property into the property of Hindu undivided
family  In this case also the attraction of clubbing
that is income of one person is taxable by another person  Now,
provisions will be there  The income includes loss, it is
significant to note that as per explanation 2 to the section 64,
income would also include loss accordingly, where the specified
income to be included in the total income of the individual
is a loss, such loss will be taken into account while
computing the total income of the individual  It is
significant to note that this explanation applies to clubbing
provisions under both section 64(1) as well as
64 sub section 2  So learners in this week, we have learned a
very important aspect and an interesting aspect of clubbing
what are the situations in which such things can happen and
of income, that is income of other persons computed in
calculating total income of the assessee's  Normally, it doesn't
happen in normal circumstances because the income tax that says
that the assessee's is liable to pay tax on his or her own income 
But there are certain situations which are explained under
Section 60 to section 64  Where the situations arise that the income
of other persons will be clubbed into the assessee's total income 
So, we have seen all such situations and have learned that
these are the occasions where the income of some other persons
will be taken into the computation of total income of
that is learners you should also note it very minutly,
the assessee's Thank you very much 
because the clubbing provisions can be attracted if a person is
unaware of the fact  No 1  section 60, transfer of income
without transfer of asset  That is if any person transfers the
income from any asset without transferring the asset, the
property or the title of the asset itself, such income is to
be included in the total income of the transferor  In that
case, such kind of transfer will not be valid  Secondly,
this week, we will learn another important topic which is given
section 61 that is income arising from revocable transfer
of assets, that is any income arising to any person by virtue
of a revocable transfer of asset is to be included in the
total income of the transferor  Now, what is revocable transfer
that is the transfer can be revoced at the option of the
tranferor 
So, such
kind of transfers will not be taken as valid transfer in the
eye of income tax and income arising from revocable transfer
will be included in the total income of the transferor by
under Income Tax Act 1961  That is clubbing of income that is
section 61 of the Income Tax Act  Section 64(1)(II)
that is income by way of remuneration from a
concern in which the individual has substantial interest that is
in computing the total income of any individual  All such income
which arises directly or indirectly to the spouse of such
individual, by way of salary, commission fees or any other
form of remuneration, whether in cash or in kind from a concern
in which such individual has a substantial interest shall be
included  Substantial internal efforts to holding off at least
20% of the voting rights  Section 64(1)(IV)
income of other persons, which are included in assessee's total
that is income arising to the spouse from an
asset transferred without adequate consideration  Where
there is a transfer of an asset other than house property,
directly or indirectly from one spouse to another, otherwise
then for adequate consideration or in connection with an
agreement to leave apart any income arising from or any
income arising to the transferee from the transferred asset,
either directly or indirectly shall be included in the total
income of the transferor  Similarly, Section 64(1)(VII)
says transfer of assets for the benefit of
income  The Income Tax Act says that a person is liable to pay
spouse  All income arising directly or indirectly to any
person or association of persons from assets transferred directly
or indirectly without adequate consideration is includable in
the income of the transferor to the extent such income is used
by the transferee for the immediate or deferred benefit
of transferor spouse 
Income arising to son's wife from the assets transferred
without consideration by the father-in-law or mother- in-law,
it is under Section 64(1)(VI) where an
asset is transferred directly or indirectly by an individual to
income tax on the income of his or her own income  But can it
his or her son's wife without adequate consideration, the
income from such asset is to be included in the total income of
the transferor  Transfer of assets for the benefit of son's wife 
All income arising directly or indirectly to any person or
association of persons from the assets transferred directly or
indirectly, without adequate consideration will be included
in the total income of the transferor to the extent such
income is used by the transferee for the immediate or
deferred benefit of transferor son's wife  So, these are the
cases where a person should be very cautious of dealing with
happen that somebody else is earning the income and the
such situations because the clubbing section of 64
subsection one will be very active and the income even
though it is transferred to some other persons will be clubbed
with the transferors income  Now, important aspect is minor
income earned by minor that is clubbing of minors income, which
is also given under section 64(1A)  All
income of a minor is to be included in the income of his or
her parent  However, the income derived by the minor for for
manual work or from any activity involving  He is our skill,
talent or specialized knowledge or experience will not be
income tax is making another person liable for such income?
included in the income of his her parent  The income of the
minor will be included in the income of that parent whose
income is greater 
Once clubbing minor's income
is done with that of one parent  It will continue to be clubbed
with that parent only in subsequent years  The assessing
officer may however, club the minor's income with that of the
other parent if, after giving the other parents an opportunity
to be heard, he is satisfied that it is necessary to do so 
Finnaly discuss section 10, sub section 32, we have seen an
Yes, it is possible and this are dealt in Section 60 to
exemption in respect of clubbed income of minor  In case the
income of an individual that is parent includes the income of
his/her minor child  Such parent shall be entitled to an
exemption of rupees 1500 in respect of each minor child 
However, if the income of any minor, so includable is less
than rupees 1500 then the entire income is exempted  There is
some instances of cross transfers that is in case of
cross transfers also  For example, Mr  A is making gift of
rupees 50,000 to the wife of his brother  Mr B for the purchase
of a house by her and simultaneous gift by Mr  B to
section 65 of the Income Tax Act, that is clubbing of income
Now let's see a discussion on set off and carry forward of
of losses  Now in case of set off and carry forward, the rule is
that first the assessee is given an option for inter source
adjustment  If inter source adjustment is not possible, then
the assessee can go for inter head adjustment  If inter head
adjustment is also not sufficient for the loss because
the loss is so high in that case the assessee can carry forward the
loss only if the loss cannot be set off by intersource
adjustment or inter head adjustment  Now, what is inter
source adjustment, which is given under Section 70 of the
Income Tax Act  Under this section, the losses incurred by
losses  It is not necessary that the assessee's will earn income
the assessee in respect of one source shall be set off against income
from any other source under the same head of income, since the
income under each head is to be computed by grouping together
the net result of the activities of all the sources covered by
that particular head  In simpler terms, loss from one source of
income can be adjusted against income from another source, both
source being under the same head  Let us take one example 
Example 1, loss from one house property can be set off against
the income of another house property  Example 2, loss from
one business, say garment selling can be set off against
every time or will earn income from all the five heads of
income from another business say grocery in the same year as both
these sources of income fall under one head of income 
Therefore, the loss in one business may be set off against
the profits of another business in the same year  Inter
source set off however, is not permissible in certain case,
like long term capital loss  Short term capital loss is
allowed to be set off against both short term capital gain and
long term capital gain  However, long term capital loss can be
set off only against long term capital gain and not from short
term capital gain  Also, there is a point on speculation loss 
income  It may happen that the assesseee may earn income from one
A loss in speculation business can be set off only against the
profits of any other speculation business and not against any
other business or professional income  However, losses
from other business can be adjusted against the profits of
speculation business 
Then loss from activity of owning and maintaining
resources  Such loss can be set off only against the income from
the activity of owning and maintaining of resources  And
there are certain loss from specified business referred to
Section 35AD that can be set off only against other specified
head of income may incur loss in other head of income or in one
business  However, losses from other business can be set off
against profits from specified business  So, besides these
exceptions, otherwise first we should go for inter source
adjustment to see whether the loss can be set off from one
source with another  If inter source adjustment is not
sufficient, then we may go for inter head adjustment which is
given under Section 71 that is loss under one head of income
can be adjusted or set off against income from another
head  However, there are certain points which must be considered 
That is where the net result of the computation of any head of
particular head of income also, the assessee may earn income from one
income other than capital gains, is a loss, the assessee can set off
such loss against his or her income assessable for that
assessment year under any other head, including capital gains
where the net result of the computation under the head
profits and gains of business or profession is a loss, such loss
cannot be set off against income under the head salaries  Where the
net result of computation under the head capital gains is a
loss, such capital loss cannot be set off against the income of
any other head  Where net result of computation under the head
income from house property is a loss and the assessee has income
particular unit may incur loss in other particular unit or the
assessable under any other head of income, the amount of such
loss exceeding rupees two lakhs would not be allowed to be set
off against the income under any other head  In other words, the
maximum loss from house property which can be set off against
income from any other head is rupees two lakhs 
Speculation loss, loss from activity of owning and
maintaining race horses, losses from specified business referred
to Section 35AD cannot be set off against income under any
other head  Otherwise we accept these exceptions  There can be
losses which should be set off from one head with another head 
losses may be so great that ultimately in the return of
income also the total is loss  So is to handle such
situations, there is a chapter call set off and carry forward
Section 71B gives set off and carry forward of loss from house
there is order of set off of losses  As per the provisions of
Section 72(2) brought forward business loss is to be
set up before setting the unabsorbed depreciation  So,
there is an order  Firstly, the current year depreciation or
current year capital expenditure on scientific research  Current
year expenditure on family planning is to the extent
allowed deducted  Then comes brought forward loss from
business and proffesion
followed by on unabsorbed capital expenditure on scientific
research
loss was computed  For example, the loss of one house property
So, through this order, the losses ultimate losses can also
be carried forward for the next assessment years 
can be adjusted against the profits of another house
property in the same assessment year  Any loss under the head
income from house property can be set off against any income
under any other head to the extent of Rs  2,00,000 in
any assessment year  However, if after such set of still there is
loss under the head capital income from house property, then
the same shall be carried forward to the next years  It is
to be remembered that once a particular loss is carried
forward, it can be set off only against the income from the same
property  If in any assessment year there is a loss under the
head in the forthcoming assessment years  Section 72 and 80
deals with carry forward and set off of business losses  Under
this act the assessee has the right to carry forward the loss from
the business and profession in case where such loss cannot be
set off due to the absence or inadequacy of income under any
other head in the same year  The loss so carried forward can be
set off against the profits of subsequent previous years 
Section 72 covers the carry forward and set off of losses
arising from business or profession  There are certain
conditions  The assessee's right to carry forward business losses
head income from house property, such loss will be first set off
under this section of that is section 72 has certain
conditions  The loss should have been incurred in the business,
profession or vocation  The loss should not be in the nature of
loss in the business of speculation  The loss may be
carried forward and set off against the income from business
or profession, though not necessarily against the profits
and gains of same business or profession in which the loss was
incurred  However, a loss carried forward cannot under any
circumstances, be set off against the income from any
other head other than profits and gains of business or
against the income of any other head to the extent of Rs 
profession  The loss can be carried forward and set off only
against the profits of the assessee who incurred the loss 
That is, only the person who has incurred the loss is entitled to
carry forward or set off the same  Consequently, the
successor of a business cannot carry forward or set off the
loss of his predecessor, except in the case of succession by the
inheritance  A business loss can be carried forward for a maximum
period of eight assessment years, immediately succeeding
the assessment year in which the loss was incurred  Section 73
deals with the losses in speculation business  Since
2,00,000 during the same year  The unabsorbed loss will be carried
speculation is deemed to be a business distinct and separate
from any other business carried on by the assessee  The losses
incurred in speculation can be neither set off in the same
year against any other non speculation income, nor be
carried forward and set off against other income in the
subsequent year  So, speculation business is an exclusive area
and it cannot be mixed up with other kinds of business  Section
73A deals with carry forward and set off of losses by
specified businesses  Any loss computed in respect of the
specified business referred in Section 35AD shall be
forward to the following assessment year to be set off
set off only against profits and gains, if any of any other
specified business  The unobserved loss if any, will be
carried forward, for set off against the profits and gains of
any specified business in the following assessment year
and so on  There is no time limit specified for carry
forward and set off and therefore, such loss can be carried forward
indefinitely for set off against income from specified business 
However, the return of loss to be filed on or before the due
date of filing of return under Section 139(1) for carry
forward of loss from specified business  So, this is regarding
against income under the head income from house property and
the rules for specified business  Section 74 deals exclusively
with the capital gains, this is losses under the head capital
gains  Section 74 provides that where for any assessment year
the net result under the head capital gains is short term
capital loss or long term capital loss, the loss shall be
carried forward to the following assessment year end to be set
off under certain conditions  That is where the loss so
carried forward is a short term capital loss  It shall be set
off against any capital gain short term or long term arising in
that year  Where the loss, so carried forward is a long term
not from any other head  The loss under this head is
capital loss, it shall be set off against long term capital
gain arising in that year  Net loss under the head capital
gains cannot be set off against income under any other head  Any
unabsorbed loss to be carried forward to the following
assessment year and up to a maximum of eight assessment
years, immediately succeeding the assessment year for which
the loss was first
computed 
There is a business of owning and maintaining race horses  So,
according to the provisions of Section 74A(3)
allowed to be carried forward up to eight assessment years,
the losses incurred by an assessee from the activity of
owning and maintaining race horses cannot be set off against
income of any source other than the activity of owning and
maintaining race horses  Such loss can be carried forward for a
maximum period of four assessment years for being set
off against the income from the activity of owning and
maintaining race horses in the subsequent years  So, just note
in other cases, it is normally eight years, but in case of
activity of owning and maintaining resources, the
losses can be carried forward for a period of four years  Now,
immediately succeeding the assessment year in which the
Welcome friends 
Britishers developed the electronic relay storage automatic calculator or the ERSAC 
A group of scientists headed by Professor Maurice Wilkes at the Cambridge University
mathematical laboratory, developed this machine 
In this machine, addition operation took one thousand five hundred microseconds and multiplication
operation took four thousand microseconds 
The UNIVAC One, Nineteen fifty one – Universal Automatic Computer One was the first commercial
computer produced in the United States 
It was designed principally by J  Presper Eckert and John Mauchley, the inventors of
ENIAC 
Design work was begun by the company Eckert Mauchley Computer Corporation 
A computer can store, process and retrieve data as and when required 
UNIVAC One used five thousand two hundred vacuum tubes, weighed twenty nine thousand
pounds, consumed one twenty five kilo watt and could perform about one thousand nine
hundred and five operations per second running on a two point two five megahertz clock 
In the nineteen seventies, programmable mini computers supplied with software packages 
The size reduction trend continued with the introduction of personal computers which are
programmable machines, small enough and inexpensive enough to be purchased and used by individuals 
The first computer of this type was called the Altair double eight double zero 
Its programming involved pushing buttons and flipping switches on the front of the box 
It didn't include a monitor or keyboard and its applications were very limited 
Computer generations – Generation in computer terminology is a step in technology 
Computer science is the study of computers and their architecture, languages and applications
It provides a framework for the growth of computer industry 
The custom of referring to computer era in terms of generations came into wide use only
after nineteen sixty four 
Although there is a certain amount of overlap between different generations, the approximate
period shown against each are normally accepted 
First generation from nineteen forty two to nineteen fifty five – ENIAC, EDVAC, ERSAC,
UNIVAC One, IBM seven naught one 
Second generation from nineteen fifty five to nineteen sixty four – Honeywell four
hundred, IBM seven zero three zero, CDC one six zero four, UNIVAC lakh 
Third generation from the period nineteen sixty four to nineteen seventy five – IBM three sixty
in all aspects as well as the mathematical structures that relate to computers and computation 
or three seventy, PDP eight, PDP eleven, CDC double six double zero 
Fourth generation, nineteen seventy five to nineteen eighty nine – IBM PC and its clones,
Apple two, TRS eighty, VAX nine thousand, Cray one, Cray two, Cray X-MP 
Fifth generation from nineteen eighty nine to present – IBM notebooks, Pentium PCs,

Successive generations have their size decreased but the capabilities, uses and reliability
increased 
They became more and more user friendly, efficient and are easier to produce commercially 
When we take in to account the software technologies and the applications of each generation computers,
it can be categorized as Generation and Software Technologies and applications 
First, Nineteen forty two to fifty five – Machine and assembly language, stored program concept
used for calculations 
Second, from fifty five to sixty four – Batch operating systems, high level programming
The characteristics of computers – The power and usefulness of computers are mainly due

language, PC based applications, network based applications 
Fifth, from the period nineteen eighty nine to present – World Wide Web, multimedia
applications, internet based applications 
Number systems – A computer stores data internally in a format that is not easily
readable by human beings 
to the following characteristics 
A computer stores characters, numbers and all special characters in coded form 
These codes are based on the number system 
Generally, number systems are of two types – non positional and positional 
In early days, human beings used fingers, stones, pebbles, etcetera to count 
This method uses non positional number system since each symbol represents the same value
regardless of its position in a number 
In positional number system, there are only a limited number of symbols called digits 
But these digits represent different values depending on the position they occupy in a
number 
We use decimal number systems in our day to day life 
Automatic- Once started on a job, computers carry out the job until it is finished 
It uses ten symbols or digits 
They are zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight and nine 
Thus, its base is equal to ten 
In a decimal number system, successive positions from right to left to the decimal points represent
units, tens, hundreds, etcetera, which is a specific power of base ten 
The number eight seven four five to the base ten can be written as eight into ten cube
plus seven into ten square plus four into ten raise to one plus five into ten raise
to zero which is equal to eight thousand plus seven hundred plus forty plus five which is
equal to eight thousand seven hundred and forty five 
From the following example, we can see that the same digit signifies different values
But we need to instruct a computer using coded instructions that specify exactly how it will
depending upon the position of that digit in the number 
In six five seven three to the base ten, the digit three signifies three into ten raise
to zero which is equal to three 
In six three five seven to the base ten, the digit three signifies three into ten square
which is equal to three hundred 
The number systems relevant to computers are binary number system 
It’s like decimal number system but the base is two because it uses only two digits,
zero and one 
Each position in a binary number represents a power of the base two 
Thus, the rightmost position is units, that is two raise to zero 
do a particular job 
In this session I am giving you a brief introduction to the fundamentals of computers 
The second from right is twos, two raise to one, etcetera 
The decimal equivalent of a binary number one one one zero one to the base two is one
into two raise to four plus one into two raise to three plus one into two raise to two plus
zero into two raise to one plus one into two raise to zero which is equal to sixteen plus
eight plus four plus zero plus one which is equal to twenty nine 
Octal number system – In octal number system, the base is eight, so there are eight symbols
or digits, zero, one, two, three, four, five, six and seven 
Each position represents a power of the base eight 
Thus, the decimal equivalent of octal number one zero two four to the base eight is one
into eight raise to three plus zero into eight raise to two plus two into eight raise to
Accuracy- Accuracy of a computer is consistently high and the degree of its accuracy depends
one plus four into eight raise to zero equal to five twelve plus zero plus sixteen plus
four which is equal to five thirty two 
Hexadecimal system – Here the base is sixteen 
Hence there are sixteen symbols or digits 
The first ten digits are same as that of the decimal number system 
They are zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight and nine 
The other six digits are the A, B, C, D, E and F  Each position represents a power of
the base sixteen 
The decimal equivalent of the hexadecimal number forty five F to the base sixteen can
be written as four into sixteen square plus five into sixteen to the power one plus F
upon its design 
into sixteen to the power zero which is equal to four into two fifty six plus five into
sixteen plus fifteen into one which is equal to thousand twenty four plus eighty plus fifteen
which is equal to one thousand one hundred and nineteen 
Algorithms – In order to solve a problem, we need to know the steps to solve the problem
and the sequence in which these steps to be applied 
As we said earlier, for the computer to solve a particular problem, it should be instructed
the steps to be followed to reach a solution 
To ensure that the instructions of a program are suitable for the problem and are in the
correct sequence, it should be planned before writing it 
Planning involves defining the logic 
A computer performs every calculation with the same accuracy 
Algorithm means logic 
It can be defined as a sequence of precise and unambiguous instructions which when executed
in the specified sequence produces the desired result 
Here, each instruction should be executed in a finite time 
There are different methods to represent an algorithm 
The important ones are-
As programs – Represented using programming language 
Every program is an algorithm but every algorithm is not a program 
As flowcharts – Pictorial representation of an algorithm 
It is used for visually organizing a sequence of steps to solve a particular problem 
Diligence- Unlike human beings, a computer is free from monotony, tiredness and lack
As pseudocodes – Instructions written in ordinary natural languages like English,
Computer languages – Just as we have various languages to communicate with one another
and each language has its own vocabulary and grammatical roles, we have different languages
to convey instructions to the computer 
Every computer language has its own rules called syntax and vocabulary called keywords 
There are three types of programming languages- machine level language, assembly level language
and high level language 
The language which a computer can understand is called a machine level language 
That is in the binary form 
The program written in machine level language is totally depended on the individual machine 
of concentration 
As machine language is the language of the CPU, programs written in this language are
executed very fast 
Writing programs in this language is very time consuming and error prone 
Because of these limitations, programs are rarely written in machine level languages nowadays 
Assembly language is one level above the machine level language 
It uses certain predefined symbolic codes called mnemonics instead of binary codes 
Assembly language closely resembles machine language and both are considered low level languages 
Since, a computer cannot understand assembly language, a translator called assembler, converts
the assembly codes to machine understandable format 
Some of the limitations of machine level language have been overcome in assembly level language 
It can continuously work for hours without creating any error and without grumbling 
But the coding and debugging continue to remain difficult as it is written using some special
character 
To solve this problem, high level languages came into existence 
Most of the programs in high level languages are written in general English 
Hence, it is easy to learn, code and debug 
High level languages are designed for providing better programming efficiency but special
translators are needed to convert the code into the machine understandable format 
There are two types of translators, namely, interpreters and compilers  
The interpreter is a special type of program that translates the program written in a high
level language into machine language at the time of executing that program line by line
If ten million calculations have to be performed, a computer will perform the last one with
and finds if any syntax error in the code 
Therefore, no object code is saved for future use because the translation and execution
processes alternate 
Most of the interpreted languages are slow in execution 
Example- BASIC, Perl, etcetera 
The compilers are special type of programs that checks for syntax errors 
If an error is found, the compiler points out the error and gives a message to the programmer 
Before a program is executed, the code is compiled and the entire high level language
program is converted into machine understandable format called object program 
The compiled form is directly given for execution, no interpretation, as it is already in the
exactly the same accuracy and speed as the first one 
machine language format 
Thus, the compiler based languages are faster 
Example- C, C plus plus, etcetera 
The basic principles of Computer Science – Even though, the size, shape, performance, reliability
and cost of computers have been changing over the years, the basic concept to store program
has not changed 
For converting the raw data into information and presenting it to a user, a computer performs
five basic operations 
One, input – Receiving data into a computer system 
Second, store – Saving data and instructions for processing 
Power of remembering- A computer can store and recall any amount of information because
Third, process – Performing arithmetic and logical operations 
Four, output – Producing results for a user, either soft copy or hard copy 
Five, control – Control the way and sequence in which these operations are performed 
Please try to answer the following questions-
Define computer 
What will be the decimal equivalent of twenty four point one eight seven five to the base
sixteen?
Convert the binary number one zero zero zero one one to the base two to decimal 
Write a short note on compilers and interpreters 
What is the role of assembler?
of its secondary storage capability 
The word computer comes from the word compute which means to calculate 
Explain the evolution of computers 
What are the different programming languages?
What are the different characteristics of a computer?

Take care 
It can retain a piece of information as long as a user desires and the user can recall
the information whenever required 
A computer forgets or loses certain information only when a user asks it to do so 
So, it is entirely up to the user to make a computer retain or forget some information 
Speed- A computer is a fast device 
Computers are capable of performing several billion arithmetic operations per second 
Versatility- It is one of the most wonderful things about a computer 
A computer is capable of performing almost any task, if the task can be reduced to a
finite series of steps 
Evolution of computers – The computer truly is one of the most incredible inventions in
Generally, a computer is considered to be a calculating device that can perform arithmetic
history 
The electronic computer has been around for over a half century but its ancestors have
been around for two thousand years 
From the first wooden abacus to the latest high speed microprocessor, the computer has
changed a lot, both internally and externally 
The main goal of computer manufacturers was to make the computer as affordable as possible
while increasing speed, reliability and capacity 
Nearly every computer manufacturer accomplished this and computers popped up everywhere 
Computers were in businesses, keeping track of inventories 
Computers were in colleges aiding students in research 
operations at high speed 
Computers were in laboratories making complex calculations at high speeds for scientists
and physicists 
The computers had made its mark everywhere in society and built up a huge industry 
Blaise Pascal invented the first mechanical adding machine in sixteen forty two 
In the year sixteen seventy one, B G  Wilhelm von Leibniz of Germany invented the first
calculator for multiplication 
Keyboard machines originated in the US around eighteen eighty 
Around the same period, Herman Hollerith came up with the concept of punched cards that
were extensively used as input medium in computers even in late nineteen seventies 
Charles Babbage, a nineteenth century professor at Cambridge University is considered to be
In fact, the original objective for inventing a computer was to create a fast calculating machine 
the father of modern computers 
Babbage designed a different engine in the year eighteen twenty two that could produce
reliable mathematical and statistical tables 
Built into his machine were operations that included everything a modern general purpose
computer would need 
It was programmed by and stored data on cards with holes punched in them, appropriately
called punch cards 
In eighteen forty two, he came out with his new idea of a completely automatic analytical
engine for performing basic arithmetic functions for any mathematical problems 
Unfortunately, he was unable to produce a working model for this machine 
However, more than eighty percentage of work done by today's computers is of non-mathematical
Some of the well-known early computers are the abacus 
It is simply a wooden rack of holding parallel wires on which beads are strung 
When these beads are moved along the wire according to programming rules that the user
must memorize, all ordinary arithmetic operations can be performed 
The Mark One Computer, nineteen thirty seven to forty four – It is also known as automatic
sequence controlled calculator and it was the first fully automatic calculating machine
designed by Howard A Aiken 
It was an electro-mechanical device based on the techniques already developed for punched
card machines which can handle twenty three digit numbers 
Though it was very complex in design and huge in size, it was extremely reliable 
or non-numerical in nature 
It was capable of performing four basic arithmetic operations- addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division and had special built-in programs to handle logarithms and trigonometric functions 
The Atanasoff-Berry Computer, from nineteen thirty nine to forty two – Doctor John Atanasoff
developed an electronic machine to solve certain mathematical equations 
The machine was called Atanasoff-Berry computer or ABC 
It used forty five vacuum tubes for internal logic and capacitors for storage 
The ENIAC, from the period nineteen forty three to forty six – The electronic numerical
integrator and calculator ENIAC was first of all electronic computers 
In nineteen forty two, John P  Eckert, John W  Mauchley and their associates, at the University
of Pennsylvania developed ENIAC for military needs 
So, more accurately, we can define a computer as a device that operates upon data 
It could add two numbers in two hundred microseconds and multiply them in two thousand microseconds 
The EDVAC, nineteen forty seven to forty nine – The major drawback of ENIAC was that its
programs were wired on boards that made it difficult to change the programs 
The electronic discrete variable automatic computer or the EDVAC used the stored program
concept in its design 
Doctor John von Neumann introduced the idea of storing both instructions and data in binary
form, that is, stored program instead of decimal numbers or human readable words 
This feature considerably influenced the development of modern digital computer because of the
ease with which different programs can be loaded and executed on the same computer 
The ERSAC, nineteen forty seven to forty nine – Almost simultaneously with EDVAC, the
Data comes in various types and sizes depending upon the type of computer application 
Welcome back 
Offline means that, human intervention is required before the device must be turned
on or the medium holding the information must be inserted into by some mechanism 
Primary storage of a computer has only a limited capacity and it is volatile 
Thus, to store huge amount of data, which need to be permanent in the system, secondary
storages have been developed 
They are non-volatile and have lower cost per bit stored, but generally have lower operational speed 
The data stored in secondary storage can partially be transferred to primary storage whenever required 
For the earlier systems, punched paper tapes and punched cards were used 
But the popular ones today are magnetic tapes, magnetic disk, optical disk and memory storage devices 
Data are stored in secondary storage in the same binary codes as in primary storage and
The characters and numbers fed to a computer and the output from the computer must be in
are made available to primary storage as needed 
A major disadvantage of the mass storage system is that, they typically require mechanical
motion and therefore require significantly more time to store and retrieve data than
a machine’s main memory 
The secondary storage devices selected for a particular application depends mainly upon
how the stored information need to be accessed 
The mainly used accessing methods are sequential or serial access and direct or random access 
Thus the commonly used secondary storage devices can be classified as- sequential access devices
and direct access devices 
Sequential access devices – Memory is organized into units of data called block 
a human readable form 
Data blocks are stored one after the other 
A sequential access storage device is one in which the arrival at desired location may
be proceeded by sequencing through other locations, so that access time varies according to location 
Information on a sequential access devices can be retrieved in the same sequence only
in which it is stored 
Its shared read write mechanism is used and this must be more from its current location
to the desired location, passing and rejecting each intermediate block 
While working with sequential access device, if an address is required out of order, it
can be reached only by searching through all the addresses stored before it 
For example, data stored at the last few locations cannot be accessed until all preceding locations
These constitute the external data representation 
in the sequence have been traversed which is analogous to a music tape cassette 
Sequential accessing is quite suitable for such applications like preparation of monthly
pay slips or monthly electricity bills, etcetera, where each address need to be accessed in line 
The commonly used sequential access device is magnetic tape unit 
Direct access devices – In many applications, we need to access information in a more direct
manner than sequential access devices allow 
As with sequential access, direct access involves a shared read write mechanism 
However, individual blocks have a unique address based on the physical location 
Direct access storage devices are also called semi random storage devices because any data
can be accessed directly and approximately equal access time is required for each location 
But the representation of data inside a computer must match the technology used by the computer
This is analogous to a music CD 
Direct access storage devices are suitable for such applications like banking system,
airline reservation system, etcetera, where immediate access may be required 
Magnetic disk, optical disk and mass memory storage devices are examples of direct access
storage devices 
Types of secondary storage devices – A wide variety of secondary storage devices is available
in today’s computers 
The most commonly used are magnetic tape, magnetic disk or diskette, CD ROMs and DVD 
Magnetic tape – Magnetic tape medium is a plastic ribbon, usually half inch or one
by fourth inch wide and fifty to two thousand four hundred feet long 
to store and process data 
Magnetic tapes are particularly suited for offline storage of large amounts of data 
Data are recorded on the tape in the form of tiny, invisible, magnetized spots on the
iron oxide side of the tape 
The tape is divided into vertical columns called frames and horizontal rows called tracks 
A character is recorded per frame using any of the alphanumeric codes 
A magnetic tape must be mounted on a tape drive before it can be used for a reading
writing of information 
A tape drive is connected to and controlled by a tape controller that interprets the commands
for operating the tape drive 
Advantages – Unlimited storage- The storage capacity is virtually unlimited because as
Storage of bits – Today’s computers store all the information, both numeric and alphanumeric,
many tapes as required can be used for storing large data 
Higher density- Large amount of data can be stored without compression 
Thus cost per bit of storage is very low for magnetic tape 
Portability- Due to the compact size and light weight, magnetic tape reels and cartridges
are also easily portable form one place to another 
They are often used for transferring data and program from one computer to another that
are not linked together 
Reusable- They are reused a number of times without loss of quality of data recording 
Limitations – No direct access- Due to the sequential access nature, magnetic tapes are
not suitable for storage of data that are accessed randomly 
as combinations of zeros and ones 
Indirect interpretation- Data stored are in the form of tiny,
invisible, magnetic spots  Hence, the contents cannot be interpreted and verified directly 
Environmental problems- Specks of dust can cause tape reading errors 
Thus, tapes need to be stored in a place with properly controlled temperature and humidity
levels 
Uses- For applications based on sequential data processing 
Example- inventory master file, backing up of data stored on online storage devices such
as disk for its offline storage 
Archiving of data which are not used frequently but which may be used once in a while 
Transferring of data which are not used frequently but which may be used once in a while 
These digits are called binary digits or bits, in short 
Magnetic Disk – Magnetic disk are the most popular direct access storage medium 
Magnetic disk are smooth metal plates coated on both sides with a thin film of magnetic
material 
A set of such magnetic plates are fixed spindle one below the other to make up a disk pack 
The disk pack is sealed and mounted on a disks drive 
Such a disk drive consists of a motor to rotate a disk pack about its axis at a speed of about
three thousand six hundred revolutions per minute 
The drive also has a set of magnetic heads mounted on arms 
Data are recorded on a disk in the form of tiny, invisible, magnetized and non-magnetized
spots, representing ones and zeros, on the coded surface of the disk 
These are only symbols whose meaning vary with applications 
Each surface is divided into concentric circles known as tracks and each track into several
sectors 
There are typically between ten and hundred sectors per track and these may be either
fixed or of variable length 
The set of corresponding tracks on all the surface of a disk pack forms a logical cylinder 
A set of disk drives are connected to a disk controller 
The disk controller aspects command from the computer and position the read write heads
of the specified disk for reading or writing 
The read write heads of the disk system are either fixed or movable 
Each read write head consists of a magnetic yoke and a magnetizing coil 
In digital circuits, a flip-flop is a term referring to an electronic circuit, a bi-stable
This module describes about the storage of data in a computer system 
Digital information can be recorded on the magnetic film by applying current pulses of
suitable polarity 
In order to access information from a disk, the disk address of the desired data has to
be specified in terms of surface number, track number and sector number 
All magnetic disk are round platters 
They come in different sizes, use different types of packaging and are made of rigid metal
or flexible plastic 
The magnetic disk can be broadly classified into two- Floppy disk and Hard disk 
Floppy disk are individually packaged in protective envelopes or plastic cases, whereas, hard
disk are packaged individually or in multiples in cartridges or contamination free containers 
multi-vibrator that has two stable states and thereby is capable of serving as one bit
Depending on the type of packaging, hard disk are further classified into Zip Bernoulli
disk, Disk packs and Winchester disk 
Access Time – Disk access time is the interval between the times of a computer makes a request
for a transfer of data from a disk system to primary storage and the time this operation
is completed 
This access time depends on the following three parameters 
First one, transfer rate – It is seek time 
The time required to move the read write head to the proper track 
Second, latency – The amount of time that elapses after the head is positioned over
the correct track until the starting position of the addressed sector passes under the read
of memory 
write head 
Third, the rate at which data is read from or written to a disk 
Advantages- Support direct access of data making them more suitable for wide range of
applications 
Due to random access property, magnetic disk are often used by multiple users simultaneously
as a shared device 
Suitable for both online and offline storage of data, example, Winchester disk and disk
packs are often used as online secondary storage devices 
Floppy disk and Zip disk are used as offline secondary storage devices 
Except for fixed type Winchester disk, storage capacity is virtually unlimited 
Flip-flop is the common name given to two state devices which offer basic memory for
Due to low cost and high data recording densities, cost for bit of storage is low 
Data transfer rate for a magnetic disk system is normally higher 
Magnetic disks are less vulnerable to data corruption due to unfavorable environmental
conditions 
Limitations- Although magnetic disk can be used for both types of applications, use of
magnetic disk is less efficient than magnetic tapes 
More difficult to maintain security of information stored on those magnetic disk that are used
as shared, online secondary storage devices as compared to information stored on magnetic
tape 
A disk crash or drive failure often result in loss of entire data stored on it 
sequential logic operations 
Not easily portable 
Winchester disk and disk pack 
Uses- For applications that require, random data processing, as a shared, online secondary
storage device, as a backup device for offline data storage, transferring of data and programs
between two computers that are not linked together 
Optical disk – During the last few years, optical disk proved to be a promising, random
access medium, for high capacity secondary storage because it can store extremely large
amount of data in a limited space 
An optical disk storage system consists of a rotating disk coated with a thin metal or
some other material that is highly reflective 
Flip-flops are heavily used for digital data storage and transfer and are commonly used
Optical disk are also known as laser disk or optical laser disk because they use laser
beam technology for data read or write 
An optical disk has one long track starting at the outer edge and spiraling inward to
the center 
This spiral track is ideal for reading large blocks of sequential data such as audio or video 
The spiral track of an optical disk is split up into equal length sectors regardless of
the position of a sector from the center 
Cost per bit of storage is very low for optical disk because of their low cost and high storage density 
The storage capacity of an optical disk equal to number of sectors multiplied by number
of bytes per sector 
in locations called registers for the storage of binary numerical data 
An optical disk drive uses laser beam technology for recording or reading of data on an optical
disk surface 
It has two laser beam sources 
One laser beam of greater intensity is used to write data by etching microscopic pits
on the disk surface and another laser beam of lesser intensity is used to read data from
the light sensitive disk surface 
To write data, laser beam is turned on and off at a varying rate due to which tiny pits
are burnt into the metal coating of the disk surface along its tracks 
To read data, the less powerful laser beam is focused on the disk surface 
This beam is strongly reflected by recorded surface known as land and weakly reflected
The term flip-flop has come to mostly denote non-transparent clock or edge triggered devices,
by the burnt surface known as pit, producing patterns of on and off reflections that are
converted into electronic signals of binary ones and zeros by sensor 
A mechanical forward backward moving read write access arm with a laser source to place
the unit to the desired place on the optical disk 
Types of optical disk – Optical disk are in different sizes and capacities 
Commonly used types of optical disk are- CD ROM – A compact disc also known as a CD
is an optical disk used to store digital data 
It was originally developed to store sounds recordings exclusively 
Philips, which define a non-volatile optical computer data storage, but later it also allowed
the preservation of other types of data 
while the simpler transparent ones are often referred to as latches 
For the first few years of its existence, the compact disc was a medium used purely
for audio 
However, in nineteen eighty five, the CD ROM standards was established by Sony and medium
used the same physical format as audio compact disc readable by a computer with a CD ROM
drive 
Standard CDs have a diameter of one twenty millimeter and can hold up to eighty minutes
of audio that is seven hundred MB of data 
A CD is made from one point two millimeter thick, almost pure polycarbonate plastic and
weighs approximately sixteen grams 
From the center outward, components are- At the center, spindle 
A flip-flop is usually controlled by one or two control signals and or a gate or clock signal 
Hole, fifteen millimeter 
The first transition area, that is, clamping ring and the clamping area, stacking ring
and the second transition area or the mirror band, the information or the data area and
the rim 
The technology was eventually adapted and expanded to encompass the data storage CD ROM 
Write once audio and data storage, CD-R, rewriteable media CD RW, video compact disc VCD, Super
video compact disc SVCD, photo CD, picture CD, CD-i and enhanced CD 
WORM that is CD-R- Compact disc recordable is a type of write once read many, WORM, compact
disc format that allows one time recording on a disc 
CD-R retains a high level of compatibility with standard CD reader 
The output often includes the complement as well as the normal output 
From this module a learner is expected to achieve the following- understands the role
A standard CD-R is a one point two millimeter thick disc made of polycarbonate with a one
twenty millimeter or eighty millimeter diameter 
The one twenty millimeter disc has a storage capacity of seventy four minutes of audio
or six fifty MiB of data 
Most CDs are on the market have an eighty minute capacity 
The polycarbonate disc contains a spiral groove called the pregroove because it is molded
in before data are written to the disc to guide the laser beam upon writing and reading
information 
CD RW- CD RW, compact disc rewriteable is a rewriteable optical disk format known as
CD erasable that is CD-E  During its development, CD RW was introduced in nineteen ninety seven 
Logic gates are electronic circuit which operate on one or more binary input signals to produce
CD RW disc need to be blank before reuse 
Different blanking methods can be used, including full blanking, in which the entire surface
of the disc is cleared and fast blanking, in which, only meta data areas are cleared 
Prior to the introduction of the CD RW technology, a standard for magnet-o-optical recordable
and erasable CDs called CD-MO was introduced in nineteen eighty eight 
Video CD- VCD, View CD and compact disc digital video is a standard digital format for storing
video media on a CD 
VCDs are playable in dedicated VCD players, most modern DVD video players, personal computers
and some video game consoles 
The VCD standard was created in nineteen ninety three by Sony, Philips, Matsushita and JVC
standard binary output signals 
and is referred to as to the white book standard 
Overall picture quality is intended to be comparable to VHS video 
Poorly compressed VCD video can sometimes be lower quality than VHS video but VCD exhibits
block artifacts rather than analog noise, and does not deteriorate further with each
use which may be preferable

Computer circuits are build up using combinations of different types of logic gates to perform
the necessary operation 
A variety of logic gates are commonly used in digital computer system 
Each gate has a distinct logic symbol and its operation is described with the help of
an algebraic expression 
The input-output relationship of a gate can be expressed in tabular form called truth table 
The various logic gates are AND gate, OR gate and NOT gate 
of computer in information processing, familiarizes the storage cell, flip-flops and gates, understands
Main memory – A memory or store is required in a computer to store programs and the data
processed by programs 
A memory is made up using large number of cells or location and each cell is capable
of storing one bit 
The cells may be organized so that it can store a fixed number of bits called word length
of memory 
Each word has a built-in and unique number assigned to it 
The number is called the address of the location and is used to identify the location 
Each location can hold either a data item or an instruction and it’s address remains
the same regardless of its contents 
the concept of main memory, learns about the classification of data storage devices, understands
The storage cells are made up of flip-flops fabricated with transistors 
These cells are called binary cells and each cell can store a binary digit 
The following figure illustrates a storage cell 
The cell has an input data line on which the symbol to be written is sent to the cell 
To write the symbol into the cell, a write control signal is sent through the write line 
If the content of the cell is to be read, a read control signal is sent on the read
line and the content of the cell may be sensed on the output line 
Entering data into a storage location is destructive or volatile and retrieving data is non-destructive 
By appropriate variation in the interconnection of binary memory cells, it is possible to
organize different types of memories 
the various techniques for accessing stored information, get an idea about the uses of
The simplest organization of a set of cells is shown here 
In this organization, three cells are interconnected in such a manner that the write control lines
of all the cells are connected together 
The read control lines are also connected together 
The bits to be written in each cell are fed to the appropriate input data lines 
When the write control signal is applied to the write line, these input bits are written
in the individual cells 
The previous contents in the cells are automatically erased when the information is written 
In order to read the contents of the cell, a read signal is applied to the common read line 
The contents of the cell appear on the respective output data lines 
different storage media 
This interconnection of cells is called the register 
This register stores three bits 
A group of registers may be interconnected to form a memory 
The two basic types of semiconductor memories are the Random Access Memory RAM and the Read
Only Memory ROM 
RAM is a read write memory 
Information can be written into and read from a RAM 
It is a volatile memory 
The information written to it, is retained in it as long as the power supply is on 
When the power supply is interrupted, the stored information is lost 
Computer data storage often called storage or memory refers to computer components, devices
The basic storage cell of a RAM is a flip-flop fabricated with transistors 
RAMs come in two varieties- Static RAM and Dynamic RAM 
A ROM is a semiconductor memory device used to store information which is permanent in
nature and has become an important part of any digital systems because of its low cost,
high speed and data non-volatility 
The information stored in it is not lost even if the power supply goes off 
It is used for permanent storage 
ROMs are much cheaper as compared to RAMs 
Depending on the programming process employs, the ROMs are categorized as- Mask programmable
ROM, Programmable ROM and Erasable programmable ROM
and recording media that retain digital data used for computing for some interval of time 
Mass Storage – Memory usually refers to a form of semiconductor storage known as Random
Access Memory or RAM and sometimes other forms of fast but temporary storage 
Similarly, storage today more commonly refers to mass storage- Optical disk, forms of magnetic
storage like hard disk and other types of slower than RAM but of a more permanent nature 
Historically, memory and storage were respectively called primary storage and secondary storage
or auxiliary memory 
The terms online and offline are often used to describe devices that can be either attached
or detached from a machine 
Online means that, the device or information is connected and is readily available to the
machine without human intervention 
There are basically two types of data which a computer can handle, characters and numbers 
Welcome to the session on Secondary Storage Devices 
Optical disk are on the way out in consumer devices, external hard drives are used for
backing up systems and thumb drives of useful most conventional file transfers 
Network Storage - These types of devices include shared file servers, network accessible storage,
that is NAS devices and cloud services 
All of these take the idea of an external hard drive and change the connection method
from USB to a full network connection 
You add file servers to your local domain and have total control over who access which
files on your server 
You can plug an NAS device to your router and every computer on your local network can
store files on it for a more informal file sharing method 
to secondary memory 
You can also use services like Dropbox, Box and SkyDrive to put the files on other vendors
servers and access them through the internet 
According to the technology used the secondary storage devices can be categorized into three
such as magnetic, optical and solid state 
Magnetic devices have a tape or disk surface, which can be magnetized with the pattern of
north and south areas to represent the binary data 
As the changing magnetic surface moves passed a read head, it reads the alternating pattern
of tiny current changes as binary digits 
Examples include hard drives, floppy disk and magnetic tape 
Optical devices use a circular disk surface where a spiral pattern of reflective and non
Secondary memory is a memory of more permanent nature 
reflective areas represents the binary data as the disk surface move passed it 
A low power laser beam tracks the spiral pattern and reflects the laser light onto a light detector 
The patterns of bright and non bright reflections form a pattern which is read as binary digits 
The commonly used optical devices include CD ROM, CD R, and CD RW disk along with the
higher capacity DVD and Blu Ray equivalents 
Solid State devices store the binary data on semiconductor material, where a pattern
of all of semiconductor switches represents the binary data 
Solid State Drive is an example of this type of device 
We have already seen the storage organization advantages and limitations of the commonly
used magnetic and optical devices 
The way people at home and in business are using storage and compute functions is changing
The hard drives are a type of magnetic media, in which binary data is stored on the magnetized
surface in a circular pattern on the surface of flat circular plates called platters 
These rotate at very high speed, and the read write head moves from side to side to load
and save data 
Files are stored on the disk in clusters arranged along tracks and spanning one or more sectors 
The tracks and sectors are created when the hard disk is first formatted, and this must
take place before the disk can be used 
For a drive to read data from a disk, the read write head must move sideways to align
with the correct track and then wait until the correct sector rotates round until underneath
it 
the way of manufacturers designing and marketing their computer products 
The floppy disk are rarely used now but three point five inch floppy disk drive can still
be found on some early computers, the floppy disk for a PC needed to be formatted before
they were used, but were usually pre-formatted to hold one point four four MB of data to
store about three fifty pages of A four text 
Just like the tape in a tape recorder, the data is returned to or read from the tape
as it passes the magnetic heads 
This means that it is necessary to start at the beginning of the tape and search for the
data as the tape goes past the head serial axis which is considerably slower than random
axis, being able to jump to a selected selection of data 
Solid State Drives – Solid State Drives are a form of flash memory it is therefore
Until recently, partially all desktop and laptop computers had optical storage devices
non-volatile like ROM, so the contents are not lost when there is no power supply, but
able to be written to as in RAM 
Applications - Solid State Devices can replace the hard drive as the main secondary storage
device in the computer where really large storage capacities are not required 
They form the main storage for PDA, smartphones and some high end laptop models 
Advantages - Solid State Devices offer faster read write times than either magnetic or optical
storage devices 
They are also silent and resistant to physical shock, which makes them ideal as portable
storage devices 
They offer relatively high storage capacities and data can be read directly from any part
such as CD, DVD or Blu ray players internally installed 
of the device that is random access 
They also can be designed to use the same interface as hard drives, thus easily replacing
them in many applications 
The disadvantages - The storage capacity cannot yet much that of modern hard drives 
Relatively expensive compared to magnetic media in terms of data capacity per unit price 
So they tend to be smaller capacity than magnetic storage devices 
Now let's have a quick look at what we have discussed in this session 
To understand the importance of secondary storage devices in the computing field, if
the data is to be stored in a permanent manner, we need to use secondary storage devices 
All quantities like length, volume etcetera represented in computer memory is measured
However, this has changed with the trend of sleeker, smaller and faster products linked
with standard units 
The standard units are bit, byte and word 
In this module, we have revisited the magnetic and optical storage and an idea about solid
state drive is given 
Hope you enjoyed this session 
See you next time bye 
to the growth of the internet and cloud computing services 
Memory Units - All quantities physical or otherwise are measured in units 
Just as we use centimeters or meters as the unit of length and grams as the unit of mass,
Computers are used to perform a variety of tasks in different realms of life such as
computer memory is measured with standard units 
Digital computers have only two states On and Off 
These two values are represented by two different voltage levels within the circuit 
Each of these values is called binary digit or bit and can be considered as a symbol for
a piece of information 
The smallest unit of data a computer can deal is a bit but usually do not deal with single bit 
A bit can contain either a zero or a one 
Usually a group of eight bits called a byte is considered to be unit 
With eight bits a byte can have two raise to eight that is two fifty six bit patterns,
and hence the presence two fifty six different symbols 
science, engineering, business, education, entertainment and many other fields 
Any binary number between eight zeros and eight ones can be represented in a byte 
In modern computers grouping of two or four bytes called computer words can represent
larger information 
The other units used to represent computer memory are Bit, Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte,
Gigabyte and Terabyte 
Primary and Secondary Storage - Primary storage is internal in your computer and is designed
to hold data temporarily 
Random access memory or RAM and cache are examples of primary storage and have the fastest
data access speed 
Secondary storage sometimes called auxiliary or external storage are internal or external
We all know that it is the smart machine that work at high speed can handle a huge amount
components, such as hard drives, solid state drives, optical drives, and thumb drives,
also called flash drives or USB drives 
Although RAM can store the data and program files used when a computer system is actually
running, it is volatile, meaning it losses its contents without a power source 
A secondary storage device is needed in a computer system to store data and program
files when the power supply is turned off 
Secondary storage must therefore be non volatile, meaning it retains its contents without the
need for a power supply 
Secondary storage may also need to have a larger storage capacity than RAM if it needs
to store operating system files, other program files and data files 
of data with supreme accuracy and after all have the ability to carry out a specified
When a computer is running, the programs and data files in use are copied from the secondary
storage into RAM referred to as loading so the CPU can access them at an accessible speed 
Any changes to the files are copied back to the secondary storage from RAM before the
computer is closed down referred to as saving 
If you have a comparison of primary and secondary memory, the following points can be noted 
It is always slower to access data from secondary storage than from primary memory, data is
stored in secondary storage is permanent it is not lost when the computer is turned off 
Secondary storage typically has a far higher storage capacity then RAM 
Importance of Secondary Storage Devices - In the previous session, we had an overview of
the different access mechanisms such as direct and random used in storage devices 
sequence of operations without any human intervention 
Secondary storage devices are a very useful component to have many times, they also go
by the name external hard drives 
Different people use them for different purposes, as they are very versatile 
The majority of secondary storage devices are used for a very simple task, backing up data 
Most likely your computer is filled with all of your music, pictures, videos and other
items of value 
You may also have expensive applications that you paid for loaded into it 
Backing up your data is always recommended in case of a hard drive crash on your computer 
Another common use of secondary storage devices is to serve as
an external hard drive  If the hard drive on your computer is getting full, why not add an external hard drive 
The memory plays an important role in helping CPU to process the data by holding the required
This simplifies the process of upgrading more storage as you do not have to crack up on
your computer 
Simply add a secondary storage device via USB port and you now have up to two terabytes
of extra space added to your computer 
This is also an ideal solution for notebook users who are unable to upgrade the hard drives
in their computers 
Many businesses will connect secondary storage devices to their network 
This acts as an easy way for them to share files 
When you connect a secondary storage device to your network, you can set up specific permissions
for anyone on your network to connect to it 
instructions and data holding the intermediate results and to store the output 
Secondary storage devices are becoming more and more portable as technology progresses 
A very popular use of secondary storage devices has becoming using them to transport data 
Type of Storage - Modern computers have dedicated RAM for running programs and large volume
of storage to record program outputs and to store data when not in use 
Large volume storage trade access speed for capacity and it comes in three broad categories,
internal to the computer, external to the computer and storage that is access to via
and network 
Internal Storage - Internal Storage is a device housed inside the computer 
It comes in two broad types, spinning disk and hard disk drives and solid state hard drives 
Spinning disk drives have platters of magnetic material that get written and rewritten by
Computer memory refers to the electronic holding place where the processor can reach quickly 
a drive head 
Solid State disk use flash memory to store data 
Solid State disk drives are much faster than spinning platters, and can fit unusual case
shapes, like the MacBook Air or Ultrabook for example, solid state drives are much more
expensive for a given capacity than a conventional spinning disk drive 
External Storage - External storage devices include removable media like optical disk
and SD cards and USB connected flash drives called thumb drives 
Because of their size and externally connected hard drives 
External Storage is used to backup computer data, move files between a computer and a
different machine without a network and make copies of something for other uses 
When we talk about memory, it generally refers to the primary memory only, and storage refers
Welcome all, in this module, we will discuss the manipulation of data within a computer 
The data and instructions stored in the primary memory are transferred to the ALU as and when
needed, intermediate results generated in the ALU are temporarily transferred back to
the primary storage, thus data may be moved from primary memory to ALU and back to primary
memory several times during the processing 
After the completion of processing, the final results are transferred to the primary storage 
The type and the number of arithmetic and logic operations that a computer can perform
are determined by the engineering design of the ALU 
The input and output of the ALU is shown in the following figure 
The ALU contains various functional units such as Adder unit to add signed integer numbers,
Shift unit to perform shift operations, Logic unit for Boolean logical operations, Multiple
data based on the instructions from user or from program 
unit for multiply integers, Division unit for integer division, Branch control unit
for comparisons, Floating point unit for floating point addition, subtraction, multiplication,
etcetera, Decimal arithmetic unit for BCD, adders and subtractors 
Control unit - The control unit selects and interprets program instructions and then coordinates
their execution 
It has some special purpose registers such as Program Control Registers, Instruction
Registers, Memory Address Registers, Memory Buffer Registers, etcetera and a decoder to
perform these activities 
Each instruction is accompanied by microcode that is very basic directions that tells the
CPU how to execute the instruction 
Processing Devices - The transformation of raw data into information is called processing 
Since, the control unit controls and coordinates the entire computer system, it can be thought
of as the central nervous system for all other components of the computer 
It obtains instructions from the program stored in the primary memory, interprets the instructions
and issue signals that cause other units of the computer system to execute them 
The functions of control unit are summarized below 
Fetches the instruction from the primary memory at the location pointed to by the program
counter register, decodes the instruction in the instruction register 
Execute the instruction by means of sequencing a series of control signals to other components
of the CPU 
Controls all data transfers between various components both external and internal 
To perform this operation, the computer uses two main components the processor and memory 
In general, controls the entire computer by means of the timing and control unit 
The functions of the control unit can be considered as two basic tasks 
They are, sequencing, control unit causes the CPU to step through a series of micro
operations in the proper sequence based on the program being executed 
Execution- The control unit causes each micro operation to be performed, for the control
unit to perform its function, it must have inputs that allow it to determine the state
of the system and outputs that allow it to control the behavior of the system 
These are external specifications of the control unit, the control unit must have the logic
required to perform its sequencing and execution functions internally 
The general model of the control unit is given below 
The processor or the central processing unit or the CPU is the brain of the computer 
Here clock which generates clock pulse, instruction register, the OP code of the current instruction
is used to determine which micro operations are to be performed, flags to determine the
status of the CPU and the outcome of the previous ALU operation 
Control signals from control bus, these are the signal inputs to the control unit to interpret
and acknowledgment 
Control Signals within the CPU, these are output signals from control unit and of
two types 
Those two cause data to be moved from one register to another and that activate specific
ALU functions 
Control signals to control bus, these are also output signals 
In a personal computer, the processor usually consists of one or more specialized chips
These are of two types, one to memory and the other to IO modules 
When the entire CPU that is both control unit and arithmetic and logic unit is contained
on a single tiny silicon chip, it's called a microprocessor 
The Stored Program Concept - The idea of storing a computer's program in its main memory is
called the stored program concept and has become the standard approach now 
The computer uses these programs by copying the instructions from memory into the control
unit as and when required, each instruction is decoded and executed in the control unit 
The order in which the instructions are fetched from memory corresponds to the order in which
they are stored in memory 
The idea was introduced in the late nineteen forties by John Von Neumann, who proposed
called Microprocessors 
that a program can be electronically stored in binary form in a memory device, so that
instructions could be modified by the computer as determined by intermediate computational results 
John W  Mauchley and J Preper Eckert contributed to this idea which enabled digital computers
to become much more flexible and powerful 
Also, engineers in England built the first stored program computer, the Manchester Mark
One shortly before the Americans build at work, both operational in nineteen forty nine 
Program Execution - To get an idea of how the overall execution process takes place,
the working of control unit is to be thoroughly understood 
Within the control unit, there are two special purpose registers, the instruction register
and the program counter 
The microprocessor is plugged into the computer's motherboard 
The instruction register holds the instruction being executed 
The program counter contains the address of the next instruction to be executing 
By this, the machine keeps track of the program being executed 
The control unit accomplishes its tasks by continuously repeating a three step process
algorithm called mission cycle 
The steps in the mission cycle are fetch, decode and execute 
Fetch - The control units request the main memory to provide it with the instruction
that is stored at the address indicated by the program counter 
Thus, the fetch process involves retrieving the contents of two memory cells from main memory 
Then the instructions received from memory is placed in the instruction register and
The motherboard is a rigid rectangular card containing the circuitry that connects the
increments the program counter by two so that the counter now contains the address of the
next instruction stored in memory 
Decode - At this step, the control unit decodes the instruction in the instruction register 
It involves making the operand field into its proper components based on the instructions op code 
Execute - The control unit then execute the instruction with the help of appropriate circuitry
to perform the requested task 
For example, consider the load instruction to load from memory 
The control unit sends the appropriate signals to main memory waits for main memory to send
the data and then places the data in the requested register, then check the instructions if it
is an arithmetic operation, the control unit activates the appropriate circuitry in the
processor to other hardware 
ALU with the character registers as inputs and waits for the ALU to compute the answer
and place it in the appropriate register 
Once the instruction which is in the instruction register has been executed, the control unit
again starts the mission cycle with the fetch step 
Since the program counter increments at the end of each fetch, it provides the control
unit with the correct address again and again 
In short, the execution of a program stored in memory involves the same process we use
while following a detailed list of instructions 
As we keep the place by marking the instructions, the computer keeps its place by using the
program counter after determining which instruction is to be executed next we would read the instruction
In modern computers, these devices are built directly into the motherboard 
Computer is basically an information processing system 
and extract its meaning then we may perform the task and return to the list of the next
instruction, in the same manner the computer executes the instruction in its instruction
register and then continues with another fetch 
The Steps for Execution of an Instruction by the CPU - First, control unit gets the
address of the next instruction to be executed from program control register and gets the
instruction from the specified memory address into the instruction register 
Second, the control unit sends the operation part of the instruction to the decoder and
memory address register 
Third, the instruction is interpreted by the decoder and the control unit sends signal
to the appropriate unit 
Some of the newer microprocessors are large and complex enough to require their own dedicated
Four, after each instruction is executed the address of the next instruction to be executed
is loaded into the PC register automatically and above steps are repeated 
Process speed and different types of processes - The control unit operations and the ALU
operations are high speed operations 
These operations are synchronized by a built in electronic clock known as system clock 
Instructions are fetched, decoded and executed according to the clock cycles 
One cycle is the time it takes to perform one operation, like moving a byte of data
from one memory location to another 
For each fetch, decode and execute several clock cycles are required thus, if the clock
cycle is short, the processor will be fast 
circuit boards, which plug into a special slot in the motherboard 
That is the speed at which an instruction is executed is directly related to the computer's
built in clock speed, which is equal to the number of pulses produced per second 
Most of the today's computers have clock speed in between point five gigahertz to four gigahertz 
Types of Processors - CISC Processors, one of the earlier goals of the CPU designers
was to provide more instructions in the instruction set of a CPU to ensure that the CPU supports
more functions directly 
Every additional instruction in the instruction set of a CPU requires the necessary hardware
circuitry, which makes the CPU more complex 
Another goal of CPU designers was to optimize the usage of expensive memory 
To achieve this, the designers tried to include more instructions in memory by introducing
The Information Processing Cycle - Different types of operations are required to process
the concept of variable length instructions, such as half word, one and a half word etcetera 
CPUs were also designed to support different types of addressing modes, CPUs with a large
instruction set, variable length instructions, and a variety of addressing modes are set
to be complex instruction set computer or CISC architecture even though they make it
easier to do translate high level language to machine language, they are complex and
expensive to produce 
The RISC processors - In nineteen eighties, it was realized that many instructions supported
by a CISC based CPU are rarely used 
Hence, it is modified by implementing only some basic set of instructions and some of
the more frequently used instructions in the hardware circuitry of the CPU 
the data and convert it into useful information 
Other complex instruction can be implemented in software by using the basic set of instructions 
Also, all the instructions are made of uniform length, so that decoding and executing the
instructions become simple and fast 
Here a notable changes all the instructions are designed in such a way that they retrieve
operands stored in registers in CPU and not from memory 
This resulted in producing faster and less expensive processes by speeding up the computation
and reducing the complexity of handling a number of address modes 
CPUs with a small instruction set, fixed length instructions and reduced references to memory
to retrieve operands are said to have reduced instruction set computer or RISC architecture 
They are faster for most applications, less complex and less expensive to produce than
The set of procedures the computer follows to receive data process data according to
CISC processes 
But the programmers should implement complex computations by combining simple instructions 
EPIC Processors - The EPIC or the Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing technology
allows the software to communicate explicitly to the processor when operations can be done
in parallel 
Thus, it is different from traditional processors and uses tighter coupling between the compiler
and the processor 
Processors based on EPIC architecture are simpler and more powerful than CISC or RISC processors 
These are designed for high end servers and workstations 
Multi Core Processors - Recent trend for making processes faster is to build multi core processor
instruction from program or user display the result that is the information to the user
chips, instead of powerful single core processor chips 
The multi core chips do not necessarily run as fast as the highest performing single core
models, but they improve overall performance by handling more work in parallel 
In a multi core processor, each core has its independent cache providing the operating
system with sufficient resources to handle multiple applications in parallel 
Chip makers like Intel, AMD, IBM and Sun have already introduced multi core chips for servers,
desktops and laptops 
The current multi core chips are dual core that is two cores per chip, quad core four
cores per chip, eight cores per chip and sixteen cores per chip 
The experts say that multi core processors are useful in server class machines, but not
and store it are called the information processing cycle 
so good on desktop systems until software vendors develop more multi threaded software 
This module gives an overview of how the data are manipulated and the main component that
is the CPU of the computer used for manipulation of this data 
This module also covers the topics such as the information processing cycle, the steps
for execution of a program etcetera 
And this module concludes by referring to the speed of the processes and some of the
different types of processes 
Before we conclude please try to answer the following questions 
Define the term data manipulation?
What are the four phases of the information processing cycle?
The information processing cycle has four parts, each part consists of one or more components 
Explain mission cycle?
What are the functions of a CPU in a computer?
What are the main functions of ALU?
What is it register?
What are the different functions of register?
Name the commonly used registers of a computer?
What is meant by the speed of a processor?
How does it relate to the clock speed?
Compare between CISC and RISC processes?
What is a multi-core processor?
Input - At this phase, the computer accepts data from some sources, such as user or program 
Processing - During this phase of the cycle, the computer's processing components perform
The processing of data and storing of information is referred to as data manipulation 
actions on the data according to the instruction from the user or program 
Output - During this step, the computer may be displaying the results of its processing
the output is in the form of text, number, graphics or sound 
The output can also be sent to a printer or transferred to another computer through some
network 
Storage - Here, the computer stores the results on a disk, tape or some other storage medium
which is more permanent in nature 
Output and storage are optional 
Central Processing Unit - The central processing unit or the CPU is called the brain of any
computer system 
Now we'll have a detailed look on data manipulation 
All major calculations and comparisons in a computer are made inside the CPU 
The CPU activates and controls the operations of other units of a computer system 
The major structural components of the CPU are Registers, Arithmetic and Logic Unit and
Control Unit 
The central processing unit and the memory architecture is given in the following figure 
These components are connected by a bus, which is a collection of parallel lines for transferring
address, data and control signals 
Buses can be both internal and external to the CPU 
The external buses connect the CPU to memory and input, output devices 
The primary function of the CPU is to execute sequences of instructions 
Data consists of individual facts or pieces of information that by themselves may not
Registers - Registers are special memory location used as the temporary storage location within
the CPU where data fetched from the memory can be held 
Within the CPU when the instructions are interpreted and executed there is a movement of information
between different parts of the computer 
So, the registers speed at the rate of information transfer 
Most computers use several types of registers, each of these registers has the ability to
receive information hold it temporarily and to pass it on to as directed by the control unit 
The length of the register is equal to the number of bits it can store 
Most of the modern CPUs have thirty two bit or sixty four bit registers which means the
register can store thirty two bits or sixty four bits 
be of much sense 
The length of the register is often referred to as its word size, the total number of register
varies from computer to computer, but there are some special registers common to all computers 
They are Memory Address Register 
It holds the address of the active memory location, it is loaded from program control
register, when an instruction is read from memory 
Memory Buffer Register - It holds the contents of the accessed memory word, the instruction
word placed in this resistor is sent to the instruction register 
A word to be stored in a memory location must be transferred first to MBR from where it
is returned in memory 
It also holds the information which is read from any memory location to where it is actually read 
The computer processes these data in different ways and converts them into useful information 
Program Control Register - It holds the address of the next instruction to be executed 
In normal programming scenario, the instructions are stored in consecutive memory locations
and are executed in sequence 
But for the branch instructions, the next instructions address will be transferred to
PC register 
Accumulator Register - It holds the data to be operated upon the intermediate results
and the results of processing, it is used during the execution after instructions 
Most of the computers have more than one accumulator register 
Instruction Register or I - It holds the current instruction being executed 
When the instruction is stored in this register the operation part and the address part of
Like any other machine, a computer is a collection of parts, and they are categorized according
the instruction are separated, the address part is sent to the MAR and the operation
is sent to the control unit 
Input Output Register or IO 
It is used to communicate with input output devices 
The input device transfers all the input information to this register and all output information
to any output device are transferred to their register 
Arithmetic and Logic Unit - The actual execution of the instruction take place at the arithmetic
and logic unit or the ALU of the computer system 
The execution of an instruction is the result of the data processing operation which is
the function of ALU 
to the kinds of work they do 
The ALU has some special purpose registers such as accumulator and necessary circuitry
to carry out all arithmetic and logic operations supported by the CPU 
The ALU consists of the instructions that is used by the control unit to request an
activity within the ALU and is capable of all arithmetic operations such as addition,
subtraction, multiplication and division 
All logic operations such as less than, equal to, greater than etcetera and Boolean operations
such as and, or, and or etcetera 
Another collection of operations available within most ALUs allows the contents of registers
to be moved to the right or the left within the register which is known as either SHIFT
or ROTATE operations 
During information processing, the computer processing components perform actions on the
Data Representation, this module describes about the representation of data while storing
The first ten digits are the digits of the decimal number system zero, one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight and nine the remaining six digits are denoted by A, B,
D, E and F representing the decimal values ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen and
fifteen respectively 
The largest single digit is F which has a decimal equivalent of fifteen, each position
in a hexadecimal number system represents a power of the base sixteen 
To the left of the hexadecimal point each digit from the right to the left have the
positional values sixteen raised to zero, sixteen raised to one, sixteen raised to two
etcetera and the right of the hexadecimal point each digit from left to the right have
the positional values sixteen raised to minus one, sixteen raised to minus two, sixteen
Two valued signals can readily be represented, stored and transmitted for example, as the
raised to minus three etcetera 
Hence, the column weights of the hexadecimal number are sixteen raised to n etcetera sixteen
cube, sixteen square, sixteen raised to one, sixteen raised to zero point, sixteen raised to
minus one, sixteen raised to minus two, sixteen raised to minus three etcetera sixteen raised
to minus n 
The decimal equivalent of the hexadecimal number one three BF point five A is one into
sixteen cube plus three into sixteen square plus B into sixteen raised to one plus F into
sixteen raised to zero plus five into sixteen raised to minus one plus A into sixteen raised
to minus two which is equal to four thousand ninety six plus seven sixty eight plus one
seventy six plus fifteen plus point three one two five plus point zero three nine zero
presence or absence of a whole in a punched card as a high or low voltage on a wire or
six which is equal to five thousand fifty five point three five one five six 
Each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits or bits called a nibble and the primary
use of hexadecimal notation is as a human friendly representation of binary coded values
in computing and digital electronics 
For example, byte values can range from zero to two fifty five in decimal but may be more
conveniently represented as two hexadecimal digits in the range zero zero through FF 
Hexadecimal is also commonly used to represent computer memory addresses 
Generally octal and hexadecimal number systems are used as a shortcut notation for binary 
Conversion between Number Systems - Numbers expressed in decimal number system are much
more meaningful to users than are values expressed in any other number system 
as a magnetic domain oriented clockwise or counterclockwise 
Any number in one number system can be expressed in any other number system, there are certain
methods to convert a number in a particular number system to any other number system 
Computer Codes - Not only numbers but letters and other symbols can also be represented
using binary digits 
Combinations of binary digits that represent numbers, letters or other symbols are called
digital codes 
There are different types of codes come into existence to represent numerical and alphanumerical
characters 
Representing Text - In general two state devices are used as physical devices to store and
process data in computers, the two states are on and off 
Representing information as bit Patterns 
Thus, all the data to be processed and stored in the form of text is normally represented
in some code of two different symbols zero and one to represent each state 
Each of the different symbols in the text like letters of the alphabet and punctuation
marks is assigned a unique bit pattern 
Thus, the text is represented as a long string of bits in which the successive patterns represent
the successive symbols in the original text 
In the nineteen forties and nineteen fifties many such codes were designed and used but
had severe communication problems 
To alleviate this situation the American National Standards Institute ANSI adopted the American
Standard Code for information interchange or ASCII 
The basic unit for representing discrete information in a computer is a bit, one bit can be considered
This code uses bit patterns of length seven to represent the upper and lowercase letters
of the English alphabet, punctuation symbols, the digits zero through nine and a limited
number of control information such as line fields, carriage returns and tabs 
Today ASCII is often extended to an eight bit per symbol format by adding a zero at
the most significant end of each of the seven bit patterns, this technique not only produces
a code in which each pattern fits conveniently into a typical byte size memory cell but also
provides one twenty eight additional bit patterns 
Although ASCII has been the dominant code for many years other more extensive codes
capable of representing documents in a variety of languages are now competing for popularity 
One of these Unicode was developed through the cooperation of several of the leading
as the information necessary for selecting one out of two possibilities, each unique
manufacturers of hardware and software 
This code uses a unique pattern of sixteen bits to represent each symbol, as a result
Unicode consists of sixty five thousand five thirty six different bit patterns which is
enough to represent the text in Chinese, Japanese, Hebrew etcetera 
Standards for a code that could compete with the Unicode have been developed by the International
Organization for Standardization 
Using patterns of thirty two bits this encoding system has the potential of representing billions
of different symbols 
A file consisting of a long sequence of symbols encoded using ASCII or Unicode is often called
a text file 
string of bits may be used to represent or code a symbol 
It is important to distinguish between simple text files that are manipulated by utility
programs called text editors and the more elaborate files produced by word processors,
both consists of textual material 
However, a text file contains only a character by character encoding of the text, whereas
a file produced by a word processor contains numerous proprietary codes representing changes
in fonts, alignment, information etcetera 
Moreover word processors may even use proprietary codes rather than a standard such as ASCII
or Unicode for representing the text itself 
Representing Numerical Values - Storing information in terms of encoded character is inefficient
when the information being recorded is purely numeric for example, the value forty five
Coding of character has been standardized to facilitate exchange of recorded data between computers 
is stored as encoded symbols in ASCII using one byte per symbol, thus a total of sixteen
bits 
Moreover the largest number we could store using sixteen bits is ninety nine however
by using binary notation that is zero and one we can store any integer in the range
from zero to sixty five thousand five thirty five in these sixteen bits, thus binary notation
is used extensively for encoded numeric data for computer storage 
Consider the following sequence, zero zero zero zero, zero zero zero one, zero zero one
zero, zero zero one one, zero one zero zero, zero one zero one, zero one one zero, zero
one one one, one zero zero zero this sequence consists of the binary representations of
the integers zero through eight 
This module focuses on encoding, text, numerical data and images, each of these techniques
By extending this counting technique we could discover that the big pattern consisting of
sixteen ones represents the value sixty five thousand five thirty five which confirms that
any integer in the range from zero to sixty five thousand five thirty five can be encoded
using sixteen bits 
Due to this efficiency it is common to store numeric information in a form of binary notation
rather than encoded symbols 
A system called Two’s compliment notation is common for storing whole numbers because
it provides a convenient method for representing negative numbers as well as positive 
For representing numbers with fractional parts such as four and half or three by four another
technique called floating point notation is used 
is based on the fundamental concept of binary digits or bits 
and processing it in a computer system 
Two's Complement Notation - The two's complement of a binary number is obtained by adding one
to the ones complement, the ones complement is formed by simply changing all ones to zeroes
and all zeroes to ones for example, the ones complement of the binary number one one zero
one one zero one one is zero zero one zero zero one zero zero, thus the two's complement
is obtained by adding one to this number 
One one zero one one zero one one is the binary number 
The ones complement is zero zero one, zero zero one zero zero that is zero zero one zero
zero one zero zero plus one which is equal to zero zero one zero zero one zero one 
So the two's complement is zero zero one zero zero one zero one 
An alternative method of obtaining the two's complement is demonstrated for the binary
Number System - A number system or numeral system is a writing system for expressing
number one one zero one one zero one one 
First start at the right and write the bits as they are up to and including the first
one, next take the ones complement of the remaining bits 
Representing Floating Point Values - In contrast to the storage of integers the storage of
a value with a fractional part requires that we store not only the pattern of zeros and
ones representing its binary representation but also the position of the radix point 
A popular way of doing this is based on scientific notation and is called floating point notation 
The following example explains floating point notation using only one byte of storage, although
machines normally use much longer patterns this eight-bit format is representative of
actual systems and serves to demonstrate the important concepts 
numerals and mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set using symbols in a
First designate the high order bit of the byte as the sign bit 
A zero in the side bit means that the value stored is non-negative and a one means that
the value is negative 
Next, divide the remaining seven bits of the byte into two groups or fields the exponent
field and the mantissa field 
Let us designate the three bits following the sign bit as the exponent field and the
remaining four bits as the mantissa field 
Suppose, a byte consists of the bit pattern zero one one zero one one one one analyzing
this pattern with the preceding format we see that the sign bit is zero, the exponent
is one one zero and the mantissa is one zero one one 
consistent manner 
To decode the byte we first extract the mantissa and place the radix point on its left side
obtaining one one one one 
Next we extract the contents of the exponent field one one zero and interpret it is an
integer stored using the three bit axis method, thus the pattern in the exponent field in
our example represents a positive two, this tells us to move the radix in our solution
to the right by two bits 
A negative exponent would mean to move the radix to the left consequently we obtain one
one point one one which is the binary representation for thirty three, here the sign bit is zero
the value represented is thus non negative, represents thirty three by one 
If the pattern is one one one zero one one one one the same as before except for the
Number systems are basically of two types positional and non-positional systems 
sign bit, the value represented would be minus thirty three by one 
Representing Images - For an image to be processed in a computer it must be represented in a
specific form which is understood by the computer 
Today's computer applications involve not only the text and numeric data but also some
complex processing, they include images, audio and video 
Important techniques for representing images can be classified into two categories Bitmap
techniques and Vector techniques 
In the case of bitmap techniques an image is represented as a collection of dots each
of which is called a pixel, that is picture element, a black and white image is then encoded
as a long string of bits representing the rows of pixels in the image where each bit
In the non-positional number system each symbol represents the same value regardless of its
is either one or zero depending on whether the corresponding pixel is black or white 
This is the approach used by most <?>*</?> machines, this bitmap approach is generalized further
for color images where each pixel is represented by a combination of bits indicating the appearance
of that pixel, two approaches are common 
In one called RGB encoding each pixel is represented as three color components a red component,
a green component and a blue component corresponding to the three primary colors of light 
One byte is normally used to represent the intensity of each color component 
In turn three bytes of storage are required to represent a single pixel in the original
image 
A popular alternative to simple RGB encoding is to use a brightness component and two color
position in a number and the symbols are simply added to find out the value of a particular number 
components, in this case the brightness component which is called the pixels luminance is essentially
the sum of the red, green and blue components together these three components contain the
information required to produce the pixel 
One disadvantage of bitmap techniques is that an image cannot be rescaled easily to any
arbitrary size 
Essentially the only way to enlarge the image is to make the pixels bigger which leads to
a grainy appearance 
Vector techniques provide a means of overcoming this scaling problem, using this technique
an image is represented as a collection of lines and curves such a description leaves
the details of how the lines and curves are drawn to the device that ultimately produce
In a positional number system there are only a few symbols called digits and these symbols
the image rather than insisting that the device reproduce a particular pixel pattern 
The various fonts available in today's word processing systems are usually encoded using
vector techniques in order to provide flexibility in character size resulting in scalable fonts 
Vector representation techniques are also popular in computer-aided design or CAD systems
in which drawings of three-dimensional objects are displayed and manipulated on computer screens 
Communication Errors - Digital circuits are normally designed with extreme accuracy such
that the probability of occurring even a single error is very small but when information is
transferred back and forth among the various parts of a computer or in storage a chance
exists that the bit pattern ultimately retrieved may not be identical to the original one 
Particles of dirt on a magnetic recording surface or a malfunctioning circuit
represent different values depending on the position they occupy in the number 
may cause data to be incorrectly recorded or read and in the case of some technologies normal background
radiation can alter patterns stored in a machines main memory 
The errors take the form of undesired changes in the bits that make up the coded information
that is a one can change to a zero or a zero to one, to resolve such problems a variety
of encoding techniques have been developed to allow the detection and even the correction of errors 
Today because these techniques are largely built into the internal components of a computer
system they are not apparent to the personnel using the machine, nonetheless their presence
is important and represents a significant contribution to scientific research 
The types of codes which only detects errors are known as error detecting codes, the types
of codes which can both detect and correct errors are known as error correcting codes 
These number systems have a radix or base 
Error Detection Scheme - Error detection is most commonly realized using a suitable hash
function or checksum algorithm 
A hash function acts a fixed length tag to a message which enables receivers to verify
the delivered message by recomputing the tag and comparing it with the one provided 
There exists a vast variety of different hash function designs, however some of them are
widely used because of either their simplicity or their suitability for detecting certain
kinds of errors 
Repetition Codes - Repetition code is according scheme that repeats the bits across a channel
to achieve error free communication, given a stream of data to be transmitted the data
is divided into blocks of bits, each block is transmitted some predetermined number of
The total number of digits available in the number system is defined as the base or radix
Modern computers store and process information represented as two valued signals 
times for example, to send the bit pattern one zero zero one the four bit block can be
repeated four times, thus producing one zero zero one one zero zero one one zero zero one
one zero zero one 
However, if this sixteen-bit pattern was received as one zero one zero one zero zero one one
zero zero one one zero zero one where the first block is unlike the other two it can
be determined that an error has occurred 
Repetition codes are not very efficient and can be susceptible to problems if the error
occur in exactly the same places for each group example ten one zero one zero one zero
one zero one zero one zero one zero one zero in the previous example would be detected
as correct 
of that number system 
The advantage of repetition code is that they are extremely simple 
Parity Bits - A parity bit is a bit that is added to ensure that the number of bits with
value of one is a given set of bits in all ways even or odd, parity bits are used as
the simplest error detecting code for binary digits there are two types of parity bits
even parity bit and odd parity bit 
An even parity bit is set to one if the number of ones in the given set of bits is odd, thus
making the total number of ones even 
An odd parity bit is set to one if the number of ones in the given set of bits is even making
the total number of ones odd 
Example, transmission using even parity, if the stream of data to be transmitted is one
The value of a digit in a number is determined by three considerations 
zero zero one the parity bit value is calculated by <?>*</?> the bits that is the parity bit
value equal to so at the parity bits zero and since, one zero zero one zero at the receiving
end if it receives one zero zero one zero computes the parity and gets reporting correct
transmission 
This mechanism enables the detection of odd number of bit errors 
If an even number of bit have errors the parity bit records the correct number of ones, even
though the data is corrupt, that is for the above sequence if the data received is one
zero one zero zero, the parity bit computed will be zero and reports correct transmission
but the data is not the same 
Before we conclude please try to answer these questions 
The digit itself, the position of the digit in the number, the base or radix of the number system 
How the data is stored in a computer?
Define number system 
What is the importance of binary system in the realm of computers?
What is meant by computer codes?
What are the different types of data processed by a computer?
Explain the methods for representing text in computers?
Explain the methods of representing numerals in binary form?
How can an image be represented in digital form?
Decimal System - The decimal numeral system also called base ten or occasionally denary
has ten as its base, it includes the digits from zero through nine the weighted value
for each position is as follows 
ten raise to n etcetera, ten raise to three, ten raise to two, ten raise to one, ten raise
to zero, point ten raised to minus one, ten raise to minus two etcetera ten raise to minus n 
Each digit appearing to the left of the decimal point represents a value between zero and
nine times power of ten represented by its position in the number 
These binary digits, or bits, form the basis of the digital revolution 
Digits appearing to the right of the decimal point represent a value between zero and nine
times an increase in negative power of ten, for example, the value seven thirty five point
one eight five is represented as follows seven into ten raised to two plus three into ten
raised to one plus five into ten raised to zero plus one into ten raised to minus one
plus eight into ten raise to minus two plus five into ten raise to minus three which is
equal to seven into ten zero plus three into ten plus five into one plus one into point
one plus eight into point zero one plus five into point zero zero one equal to seven hundred
plus thirty plus five plus point one plus point zero eight plus point zero zero five
which is equal to seven thirty five point one eight five 
Binary Number System - The base of the binary number system is two, in this system only
The familiar decimal or base ten representation has been in use for over a thousand years
two symbols zero and one are used, each position in the binary number system represents a power
of two, the weighted value for each position is as follows 
two raise to n etcetera two raise to three, two raise two, two raise to one, two raise
to zero, point two raise to minus one, two raise to minus two, etcetera two raise to
minus n 
All bits to the left of the binary point have weight that are positive powers of two and
all the bits to the right of the binary point have weight that are negative powers of two 
The decimal equivalent of the binary number one one zero zero one one one point zero one
one is one into two raised to five plus one into two raised to four plus zero into two
raised to three plus zero into two raised to two plus one into two raised to one plus
having been developed in India improved by Arab mathematicians in the twelfth century

raise to minus two plus one into two raise to minus three which is equal to thirty two
plus sixteen plus zero plus zero plus two plus one plus zero plus one by four plus one
by eight which is equal to thirty two plus sixteen plus two plus one plus point two five
plus point one two five which is equal to fifty one point three seven five 
The binary digit is often referred to by the abbreviation bit 
A bit in computer terminology means either a zero or a one 
Rather than accessing individual bits in memory most computers use blocks of eight bits or
bytes as the smallest addressable unit of memory 
A machine level program use memory as a very large array of bytes referred to as virtual memory 
and brought to the west in the thirteenth century by the Italian mathematician Leonardo
Every byte of memory is identified by a unique number known as its address and the set of
all possible addresses is known as the virtual address space, as indicated by its name this
virtual address space is just a conceptual image presented to the machine level program,
the actual implementation uses a combination of random access memory or RAM, disk storage,
special hardware and operating system software to provide the program with what appears to
be a monolithic byte array 
Octal Number System - The octal system has base eight, in this system there are eight
symbols are used such as zero, one, two, three, four, five, six and seven 
To the left of the octal point all the bits have weights that are positive powers of eight
and all the bits to the right of the octal point have weights that are negative powers of eight 
Pisano better known as Fibonacci 
Thus, the column bits of an octal number are eight raised to n etcetera eight raised to
three, eight raised to two, eight raised to one, eight raised to zero point eight raised
to minus one, eight raised to minus two, eight raised to minus three, etcetera eight raised
to minus n 
Here all bits to the left of the octal point have weight that are positive powers of eight
and all the bits to the right of the octal point have weight that are negative powers
of eight which is illustrated in the given example 
The decimal equivalent of the octal number four zero six seven point two zero five is
four into eight cube plus zero into eight square plus six into eight raised to one plus
seven into eight raised to zero plus two into eight raised to minus one plus zero into eight
Using decimal notation is natural for ten fingered humans but binary values work better
raised to minus two plus five into eight raised to minus three which is equal to two zero
four eight plus zero plus four eight plus seven plus point two five plus zero plus zero
point zero zero nine seven six five which is equal to two thousand one hundred and three
point two five nine seven six five 
Octal is sometimes used in computing instead of hexadecimal perhaps most often in modern
times in conjunction with file permissions under UNIX systems 
It is also used for digital displays, octal numbers that are used in some programming
languages like C, Pearl etcetera for textual or graphical representations of byte strings 
Hexadecimal System - In hexadecimal number system the base is sixteen since, the base
is sixteen we need sixteen single character digits or symbols 
when building machines that store and process information 
Division by two can be accomplished by shifting the binary strings to the right, but while
shifting the sign bit will preserved 
Hence, the shifts that lead with sign bit unchanged are sometimes called arithmetic
shifts, but, numerous variations exist for each arithmetic operation 
Computer-Peripheral Communication- The main memory and the CPU are considered to be the
core of a computer 
This core communicates with a wide variety of peripheral devices like mass storage systems,
keyboard, mouse, printers, monitors etcetera and other computer 
The peripherals connected to a computer needs special communication means,* for interfacing
them with the CPU, because there exist a difference between CPU and the peripheral devices 
Moving the bits within the registers is commonly referred to as shift or rotate operations 
The main differences are Peripherals are electro-mechanical and electro magnetic devices and their manner
of operation is different from the operation of the electronic devices like CPU and memory 
Therefore a conversion of signal values is required 
The data transfer rate of peripherals is usually slower than the transfer rate of the CPU,
and thus a synchronization mechanism may be needed 
Data codes and formats in peripheral differ from the word format in the CPU and memory 
The operating modes of peripherals are different from each other, and each must be controlled
so as not to disturb the operation of other peripherals connected to the CPU 
To resolve these differences computer systems include special hardware components between
the CPU and peripherals, to supervise and synchronize all input and output transfers 
Arithmetic operations- The basic arithmetic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication
These components are called interface unit, because the interface between the processor
and the peripheral devices 
Controller- Communication between a computer and other devices is handled through an intermediator
called controller 
The controller may consist of circuitry permanently mounted on the computers motherboard, or it
maybe in the form of a circuit board that plugs into a slot on the motherboard 
The controller connects through cables to peripheral devices or to some connector called ports 
A controller translates messages and data back and forth between forms compatible with
the internal characteristics of the computer and those of the peripheral device to which
it is connected 
and division, but, subtraction is performed by negating and adding 
Now, it has developed the some standards such as USB and FireWire, so that a single controller
is able to handle a variety of devices, rather than a different controller for each type of devices 
Each controller communicates with the computer by means of the same bus that connects the
computer CPU and main memory 
With this arrangement, the CPU is able to communicate with the controller attached to
the bus in the same way as with main memory 
Direct Memory Access or DMA- The controller is attached to a computers bus and it can
be carryout its communication with main memory, during only those times when the CPU is not
using the bus 
This ability is significant factor for the computers performance and is called the Direct
Multiplication is repeated addition and division is repeated subtraction, hence smaller CPU’s
Memory Access or DMA 
By this, the CPU can execute a program while the controller transfers data between the
disk and the main memory 
Thus, the computer resources of the CPU are not wasted during data transfer which is relatively
a slow process 
Handshaking- The transfer of data between two computer components is often a two way
dialogue known as handshaking 
Here the computer and the peripheral device exchange information about the device status,
and coordinate their activities 
The status word is a bit pattern that is generated by the peripheral device and sends to the controller 
are designed with only add instructions or only add and subtract instructions 
The status word often reflects the condition of the device 
The status word is actually a bitmap and depending on the system the controller responds to this
status information, itself or make it available to the CPU 
Hence, the status word provides a mechanism to coordinate the communication with the peripheral devices 
Modes of Communication- Communication between computing devices is handled over two types
of path that is parallel and serial 
These prefer to the manner in which signals are transferred from one to the other 
In parallel communication several signals are transferred at the same time using separate lines 
Parallel communication is useful of transferring data rapidly but requires a relatively complex
communication path 
Different varieties of instructions exist for arithmetic operation 
Data transfer through computer's internal bus is an example for this type of communication 
Serial communication is the other type of data transfer which is based on transferring
signals one after the other over a single line 
Serial communication is popular because the data path is simpler than parallel communication 
USB, FireWire and Ethernet connections by wire or radio broadcast are popular for serial
communication system for shorter distances 
For longer distances traditional voice telephones lines are commonly used 
The transfer of digital data over these lines is accomplished by first converting bit patterns
into audible tones with the help of a modem 
Then serially transfers these tones over the telephone system and convert the tones back
Though these operations are applied on numerical values, the techniques differ for integers
into bits by another modem 
For high quality long distance communication, DSL or the Digital Subscriber Line is the
service provided by the telephone companies 
DSL uses frequencies above the audible range to transfer digital data, while leaving the
lower frequency spectrum for voice communication 
Other systems are cable television systems and satellite links through radio broadcast 
Other architectures, there are some alternatives to the traditional machine architecture, some
of them are pipelining 
Increasing only the execution speed may not improve a computer’s performance 
The actual goal is to improve the machines throughput, which is the total amount of work
and floating point values 
the machine can accomplished in a given amount of time 
Increasing throughput without an increase in execution speed involves pipelining 
It is the technique of allowing the steps in the machine cycle to overlap that is while
one instruction is being executed, the next instruction can be fetched, which means that
more than one instruction can be in the pipe at any time each at a different stage of being processed 
As a result the total throughput of the machine is increased, even when the time require to
fetch and execute each individual instruction remain the same 
Modern machine designs use pipelining as capable of fetching several instructions at the same
time and actually executing more than one instruction at a time 
Multiprocessor Machines- Pipelining can be viewed as a first approach toward parallel processing 
For integers, it requires the column by column addition, which is a straight forward method 
But, it is actually in need more than one processing unit for actually need the performance
of several activities at the same time 
Today a variety of computers are made using this idea 
One technique is to attach several processing units, each as the CPU in a single processor
machine to the same main memory 
Here processor can proceed independently while coordinating their actions by leading messages
to one another in the shared memory cell 
The traditional architecture is Single - Instruction stream, Single - Data stream or SISD architecture 
In which a single processor, executes a single instruction stream, to operate on data stored
in a single memory 
But, for floating point values it should first extract the mantissa of each, shift them right
The main process of data manipulation involves three steps, searching or retrieving the instructions
That is in architecture called MIMD or Multiple Instruction stream, Multiple Data stream 
In which, when one processor is faced with a large task, it will store a program for
part of that task in the common memory and then request another processor to execute it 
In other multiprocessor architecture that link the processor together, so that they
execute the same sequence of instructions in unison each with its own set of data 
This is the single instruction stream multiple data stream architecture 
These are useful in applications in which same task must be applied to each set of similar
items, within a large block of data 
Another approach to parallel processing is to construct large computers as combinations
of smaller machines, each with its own memory and CPU 
or left according to the exponent field 
Within such a architecture each of the small machine is arranged with its neighbor, such
that task assign to the system can be divided among the individual machines 
The original task can then be completed in much less time than would be a require by
a single processor machine 
The manipulation of data involves different kinds of computational operations 
The processing of data is carried out mainly by the operation within the ALU 
Hence, this module gives an overview of the different operations such as arithmetic and
logic operations along with shift operation 
This module also covers the various components and techniques involved in communication between
computer and peripheral devices, such as controller, DMA and handshaking 
Check the sign bits and then perform the addition 
This module concludes by referring to the different processor architecture

Fifth, what is the role of a controller in communication with peripheral devices?
Sixth, Compare between serial and parallel communications 
Seventh, what is meant by pipelining?
Hope you enjoyed the session 
See you next time, until then bye 
Again these steps are to be perform in reverse to store the result in floating point notation 
Since each value is internally stored in Two’s complement form, it is big a complex procedure 
Thus, both operations are set to be addition, but the procedure varies according to the type 
Logic operations- The logic operations such as AND, OR and XOR combine two input bit to
produce a single output bit 
Logical AND- the symbol dot is used for logical AND operator, the logical AND operator can
be defined by listing all possible combination of logical variables A and B 
And the resulting values of Boolean variable C in the equation A dot B equals C, the truth
in data from memory, decode it and then execute the instruction upon the data specify 
table for a logical AND is given below 
Logical OR- The symbol plus is used for logical addition 
The OR operation can be defined by listing all possible combinations of Boolean variables
A and B, and the resulting values of the Boolean variable C in the equation A plus B equals
C, the truth table for logical OR is as follows 
Logical X OR- The XOR or the exclusive OR produces an output of one for odd numbers
of one in the input 
It is normally denoted by the symbol rounded plus, the truth table for the XOR operation
is given below 
These operations can be extended two operations that combine two things of bits to produce
To have a clear idea about the execution, the computational instructions must be closely examine 
a single output string, by applying the basic operation to individual column bits 
For example, by ANDing the bit patterns one zero zero one zero one one zero and one zero
zero one one zero zero results in one zero zero one zero one one zero and one zero zero
zero one one zero zero, results in one zero zero zero zero one zero zero 
The OR operation and XOR operation is can be perform on two strings of bits in the same manner 
One zero zero one zero one one zero OR one zero zero zero one one zero zero, results
one zero zero zero zero one zero zero 
And one zero zero one zero one one zero XOR one zero zero zero one one zero zero, results
zero zero zero one one zero one zero 
An important use of the AND operation is for placing zero’s in one part of bit pattern
This module describes the arithmetic and the logic instructions, in this module a brief
without disturbing the other part 
For example, if the byte one one one one zero zero zero zero is the first operand of an
AND operation, without considering the content of the second operand 
We can conclude that the foremost significant bits of the result will be a copy of the part
of the second operand, and the four least significant bits of the result will be zeros 
That is one one one one zero zero zero zero AND zero one zero one zero one zero one gives
zero one zero one zero zero zero zero 
This use of the AND operation is an example for masking, here one operand called the mask
determines which part of the other operand will affect the result 
Masking produces a partial replica of one of the operands, with non duplicated positions
description on the communication of computer with peripheral devices is also given 
occupying zeros 
Masking is useful when manipulating a bit map, bit-map is a string of bits, in which
each bit represents the presence or absence of a particular object, bit maps are mainly
used for representing images 
The bit maps used in a memory cell are used to find out whether the object is associated
with the particular bit from the high order end 
For example, the fourth bit is present, it just need to AND in their bytes with the mask
zero zero zero one zero zero zero zero, which produces a byte of all zeros 
If and only if the fourth bit from the high order end of the bit map is itself zero 
If the second bit from the high order end of the bitmap is a one, and we want to change
Arithmetic and logic instruction- This instruction consists of arithmetic, logic and shift operations 
it to a zero without disturbing the other bits 
We can AND the bitmap with the mask one zero one one one one one one and then store the result 
As the AND operation can be used to duplicate a part of a bit string, by placing zeros in
the non duplicated part 
The OR operation can be used it to duplicate a part of a string, while putting ones in
a non duplicated part 
For this the mask will have zeros for those bits to be duplicated and ones for non duplicated positions 
For example, ORing one one one one zero zero zero zero produces ones in its most significant
for bits, while the remaining bits have a copy of the list significant for bits of the
other operand 
Arithmetic operation can be apply on numerical values to add, subtract, multiply or divide 
That is one one one one zero zero zero zero OR one zero one zero one zero one zero results
one one one one one zero one zero 
XOR operation is used in forming the complement of a bit string, XORing in a byte with a mask
of all ones produces the complement of the byte 
Example, one one one one one one one one XOR one zero one zero one zero one one, produces
zero one zero one zero one zero zero 
Shift and Rotate operations- these operations provide a means for moving bits within a register,
and are often used in solving alignment problems 
These operations are classified by the direction of motion right or left and whether the process
is circular 
The logic operations are basically the operations performed by logic gates, and the main operations
Consider a register containing a byte of bits 
If it is shifted by one bit to the right, the right most bit will fall off the edge
and a hole appears at the leftmost end 
Hence, the extra bit at the right end  is placed in the hole at the left end, the
result is a circular shift or a rotation 
In other technique is discard the bit that falls off the edge and always fill the hole
with the zero, this is refer to as logical shift 
Such shift to the left can be used for multiplying two’s complement representations by two 
Just as left shift of the decimal digits correspond to multiplication by ten, shifting binary
digits to the left corresponds to multiplication by two 
are AND, OR, NOT and XOR 
﻿Welcome to the session on  communication and instruction format   
the buses to manage the transfer directly  between the IO devices and the memory unit   
Bus- Inside computers, there are many internal  components  In order for these components to  
communicate with each other they make  use of wires that are known as bus   
A bus is a common pathway through which  information flows from one computer component to  
another  This pathway is used for communication  purpose and it is established between  
two or more computer components  Functions of  buses in computer data sharing- All types of  
buses found in a computer transfer data between  the computer peripherals connected to it   
The buses transfer or send data in either  serial or parallel method of data transfer   
This allows for the exchange of one, two,  four or even eight bytes of data at a time,  
by this group of eight bits  Buses are classified depending  
components  IO devices can be secondary memories,  for example, disk and tapes, or devices used to  
on how many bits they can move at the same  time, which means that we have eight-bit,  
sixteen-bit, thirty two-bit or even sixty four-bit  buses  Addressing- A bus has address lines which  
match those of the processor, this allows data  to be sent to or from specific memory locations   
Power- A bus supplies power to  various peripherals connecting to it   
Timing- A bus provides a system clock signal  to synchronize the peripherals attached to it  
with the rest of the system  Instruction format- An instruction  
format defines the layout of the bits of an  instruction, in terms of its constituent parts   
An instruction format must include an opcode and  implicitly or explicitly zero or more operands   
Each explicit operand is referenced using one of  the addressing modes that are available for that  
machine  The format must implicitly or explicitly  indicate the addressing mode of each operand   
communicate directly with users such as video  displays, keyboards and mouse  The communication  
Foremost instruction sets more than  one instruction format is used   
The bits of an instruction are divided into groups  called fields  The most common fields found in  
instruction formats are an operation code field  that specifies the operation to be performed   
An address field that designates a memory  address or a processor register  A mode  
field that specifies the way the operand  or the effective address is determined   
Other special fields are sometimes employed  under certain circumstances  The operation  
code field of an instruction is a group of bits  that define various processor operations, such as  
add, subtract, complement and shift  Address  fields contain either a memory address field  
or a register address  Mode fields offer a  variety of ways in which an operand is chosen   
An instruction is of various lengths depending  upon the number of addresses it contains   
channels that tie the system together can  either be simple links that connect two devices,  
Generally, CPU organization is of three types  on the basis of number of address fields,  
single accumulator organization, general  register organization and stack organization   
In the first organization operation involves  a special register called accumulator   
In second or multiple registers are used for  the computation purpose  In third organization  
the work on stake basis operation due to  which it does not contain any address field   
It is not necessary that only a single  organization is applied, a blend of various  
organizations is mostly what we see generally  Instruction cycle- An instruction cycle also  
known as fetch decode execute cycle is the  basic operational process of a computer   
This process is repeated continuously by the  CPU from boot up to shut down of computer   
The circuits used in the CPU during the cycles  are Program Counter or PC  It is an incrementing  
or more complex switches that interconnect  several components, and allow any two of them  
counter that keeps track of the memory address of  which instruction is to be executed next  Memory  
Address Register or MAR- The address in main  memory that is currently being read or written   
Memory Buffer Register or MBR- A two-way register  that holds data fetched from memory, and ready for  
the CPU to process or data waiting to be stored  in memory  Current Instruction Register or CIR-  
A temporary holding group for the instruction  that has just been fetched from the memory   
Control Unit or CU- Decodes the  program instruction in the CIR,  
selecting machine resources such as a data source  register and a particular arithmetic operation,  
and coordinates activation of these resources   
Arithmetic logic unit or ALU- Performs  mathematical and logical operations   
Following are the steps that  occur during an instruction cycle   
to communicate at a given point in time  When a switch is configured to allow  
Fetch the instruction- the instruction is  fetched from memory address that is stored  
in PC that is program counter, and stored in the  instruction register IR  At the end of the fetch  
operation PC is incremented by one and it then  points to the next instruction to be executed   
Second is decode the instruction, the instruction  in the IR is executed by the decoder  Third,  
read the effective address  If the instruction has  an indirect address, the effective address is read  
from the memory  Otherwise operands are directly  read in case of immediate operand instruction   
Fourth step is execute the instruction,  the control unit passes the information  
in the form of controls signals to  the functional unit of CPU  The result  
generated is stored in main memory or sent to  an output device  The cycle is then repeated  
by fetching the next instruction, thus in this way  the instruction cycle is repeated continuously   
two devices to exchange information, all other  devices that relay on the switch are blocked   
Instruction set- an instruction set is a group  of commands for a CPU in machine language  The  
term can refer to all possible instructions  for a CPU or a subset of instruction to enhance  
its performance in certain situations  All CPU’s have instruction sets that enable  
commands to the processor directing the  CPU to switch the relevant transistors   
Some instructions are simple, read, write and move  commands that direct data to different hardware   
The instruction set provides commands to the  processor, to tell it what it needs to do   
The instruction set consists of addressing modes,  instructions, native data types, registers,  
memory architecture, interrupt and execution*  handling and external IO  An example of an  
instruction set is x eighty six instruction set,  which is common to find on computers theory   
Different computer processors can use almost  the same instruction set, while still having  
That is they must wait until the switch can  be reconfigured  All units in the computer  
very different internal design  Both the Intel  Pentium and AMD Athlon processors use nearly the  
same x eighty six instruction set  The instruction set can be built into the hardware of the processor,  
or it can be emulated in software using an  interpreter  The hardware design is more  
efficient and faster for running programs  than the emulated software wish  Examples  
of instruction set are ADD – to add two numbers  together  Compare - Compare numbers  IN- Input  
information from a device, example- keyboard,  JUMP - Jump to designated RAM address   
JUMP IF - Conditional statement that  jumps to a designated RAM address   
LOAD - Load information from RAM to the  CPU  OUT - Output information to the device,  
example monitor  STORE - Store information to RAM   
In the early days of computing, the  cost of computer memory was very high,  
system work in conjunction with each other to  formulate a functioning computer system, to have  
and the amount of memory available tended to be  limited by this factor  Limiting the size of a  
program in memory was therefore an important  consideration  Program size was influenced by  
the number and the size of the instructions  required to carry out a particular task   
An instruction set with a high code density  used powerful instructions that could perform  
several functions at once  There are two  prevalent instruction set architectures   
Complex Instruction Set Architecture, CISC- The  CISC approach attempts to minimize the number of  
instructions per program, sacrificing  the number of cycles per instruction   
The other is, Reduced Instruction Set  Architecture, RISC- RISC does the opposite,  
reducing the cycles per instruction at the  cost of the number of instructions per program   
CISC architecture- Computers  based on the CISC architecture are  
a proper coordination between these units such  as processor, memory and IO devices  A reliable  
designed to decrease the memory cost  Because the large programs need more storage,  
thus increasing the memory cost and  large memory becomes more expensive   
To solve these problems the number of  instructions per program can be reduced by  
embedding the number of operations in a single  instruction, thereby, making the instructions  
more complex  Example of CISC processors  are IBM three seventy one sixty eight- It  
was introduced in the year nineteen seventy   CISC design is a thirty two-bit processor and  
four sixty four-bit floating point registers  VAX eleven seven eighty- CISC design is a thirty  
two-bit processor and it supports many numbers  of addressing modes and machine instructions,  
which is from Digital Equipment Corporation   Intel eight zero four eight six- It was launched  
in the year nineteen eighty nine and it is a  CISC processor, which has instructions varying  
and robust means of communication is required   Processor to memory communication- The whole  
The main components in a typical  computer system are the processor,  
lengths from one to eleven and it will have a  two thirty five instructions  RISC architecture-  
Reduced instruction set computer is a type of  microprocessor architecture that utilizes a small  
highly optimized a set of instructions  Rather  than a more specialized a set of instructions  
often found in other types of architectures  It is a dramatic departure from historical  
architectures  Most RISC architectures have fixed  length instructions commonly thirty two bits,  
and a simple encoding which simplifies fetch,  decode and issue logic considerably  RISC designs  
have a model, where the instruction stream and the  data stream are conceptually separated  This means  
that modifying the memory where code is held might  not have any effect on the instructions executed  
by the processor  Because the CPU has a separate  instruction and data cache, at least until a  
special synchronization instruction is issued  On the other hand this allows both caches to be  
process of communication between the processor  and the memory can be divided into two steps   
assessed simultaneously, which  can often improve performance   
Examples of RISC processors  The ARM architecture-  dominates the market for low power and low cost  
embedded systems  It is used in a number of  systems such as most Android-based systems,  
the Apple iPhone and iPad, Microsoft Windows  Phone, etcetera  IBM’s Power Architecture- It  
is found in the GameCube, PlayStation three,  Xbox three sixty and other gaming consoles   
The MIPS line- Used now in the PlayStation,  PlayStation two, and residential gateways like  
Linksys WRT fifty four G series  Now,  let us summarize the session     
The most important and expensive  component of a computer is the processor   
All the other characteristics of computer depend  on the maximum utilization of the processor   
The processor should get the data and  instruction as and when required, the  
Namely, information transfer from the memory  to the processor and writing information in  
communication and instruction formats play a key  role in this  Hence, in this session we have seen  
the communication between processor and memory,  that between processor and devices etcetera   
The different types of instruction formats and  the two important architectures, such as CISC and  
RISC are also mentioned here  Hope you enjoyed the  session, see you next time, until then bye 
the memory  Communication between memory and  processing unit consists of two registers,  
Memory Address Register, MAR and Memory Data  Register, MDR  The sequence of events takes place  
when information is transferred from memory to the  processor are, the processor places the addresses  
in MAR through the address bus  The processor  issues a READ command through the control bus   
The memory places retrieved data on the data bus,  which is then transferred to the processor   
Based on the read time of the memory, a specific  number of processor clock in the wells are  
allotted for the completion of this process   During this interval the processor is forced to  
wait, similarly, the following sequence of events  takes place, when information is written into the  
memory, input output devices and the  communication channels that connect them   
memory  The processor places the addresses in MAR  through the address bus  The processor transmits  
the data to be written in memory using the data  bus  The processor issues a WRITE command to the  
memory by the control bus  The data is written  in memory at address specified in MAR   
The main concern in processor memory  communication is the speed mismatch between  
memory and the processor  Memory access time  is generally slower than the CPU’s access time,  
hence, it is forced to wait for the data  This  speed mismatch is eliminated by using a small  
fast memory, as an intermediate buffer between  processor and the memory called the cache   
Cache memory- Cache memory  provides faster data storage  
and access by storing instances of programs, and  the data routinely accessed by the processor   
Thus, when a processor requests data that  already has an instance in the cache memory,  
The processor is the work host of the system   It is the component that executes a program  
it does not need to go to the main memory or the  hard disk to fetch the data  Cache memory can be  
primary or secondary cache memory, with primary  cache memory directly integrated into or closest  
to the processor  In addition to hardware based  cache, cache memory also can be a disk cache,  
where a reserved portion on a disk stores and  provides access to frequently access data or  
applications from the disk  Format of the Cache  Hierarchy- Cache memory is fast and expensive,  
traditionally it is categorized as  levels that describe its closeness  
and accessibility to the microprocessor  L one cache- L one cache or primary cache  
is extremely fast, but relatively small and  is usually embedded in the processor chip  
as CPU cache  L two cache- L two cache or  secondary cache is often more capacities than  
L one  L two cache maybe embedded on the CPU,  or it can be on separate chip or co-processor,  
by performing arithmetic and logical operations  on data  It is the only component that creates  
and have a high speed alternative system bus  connecting the cache and CPU  That way it does  
not get slowed by traffic on the main system bus   Level three or L three cache- Level three cache  
is specialized memory developed to improve the  performance of L one and L two, L one or L two can  
be significantly faster than L three  Though L three is usually double the speed of RAM  
with multi-core processor, each core can  have dedicated L one and L two cache,  
but they can share an L three cache  If an L  three cache references an instruction, it is  
usually elevated to a higher level of cache  Cache  memory mapping- Caching configurations continue to  
evolve  But, cache memory traditionally works  under three different configurations, such as  
direct mapped cache, fully associative cache  and set associative cache  Direct mapped cache-  
Direct mapped cache has each block mapped  to exactly one cache memory location   
new information by combining or modifying  current information  Memory is a passive  
Conceptually, direct mapped cache is  like rows in a table with three columns   
The data block or cache line that contains the  actual data fetched and stored are tagged with  
all or part of the address of the data that was  fetched, and a flag bit that shows the presence  
in the row entry of a valid bit of data  Fully  associative cache- Fully associative cache mapping  
is similar to direct mapping in structure  But,  allows a block to be mapped to any cache location  
rather than to a pre-specified cache memory  location, as is the case with direct mapping   
Set associative cache- Set associative cache  mapping can be viewed as a compromise between  
direct mapping and fully associative mapping  in which each block is mapped to a subset  
of cache locations  It is sometimes  called n-way set associative mapping,  
which provides for a location in main memory to  be cache to any of n locations in the L one cache   
component that simply stores information until  it is requested by another part of the system   
Processor to IO Devices Communication- The  method that is used to transfer information  
between internal storage and external IO  devices is also known as IO interface   
The CPU is interfaced using special communication  links by the peripherals connected to any computer  
system  These communication links are used  to resolve the differences between CPU  
and peripheral  There exists special hardware  components between CPU and peripherals to  
supervise and synchronize all the input and  output transfers that are called interface units   
The binary information that is  received from an external device is  
usually stored in the memory unit   The information that is transferred  
from the CPU to the external device  is originated from the memory unit   
CPU merely processes the information but the  source and target is always the memory unit   
During normal operations it feeds instructions  and data to the processor, and at other times  
Data transfer between CPU and the IO devices  maybe done in different modes  Data transfer  
to and from the peripherals maybe done in any of  the three possible ways  Programmed IO, interrupt  
initiated IO and direct memory access or DMA   Programmed IO- It is due to the result of the IO  
instructions, better returned in the computer  program  Each data item transfer is initially  
by an instruction in the program, usually the  transfer is from a CPU register and memory   
In this case it requires constant monitoring  by the CPU of the peripheral devices   
Interrupt initiated IO- Since in the above  case we saw the CPU is kept busy unnecessarily,  
this situation can very well be avoided by using  an interrupt driven method for data transfer   
By using interrupt facility and special commands  to inform the interface to issue an interrupt  
request signal, whenever data is available from  any device  In the mean time the CPU can proceed  
it is the source or destination of data  transferred by IO devices  Input output devices  
for any other program execution, the interface  meanwhile keeps monitoring the device   
Whenever it is determined that the device  is ready for data transfer, it initiates  
an interrupt request signal to the computer   Upon detection of an external interrupt signal,  
the CPU stops momentarily the task, that it was  already performing, branches to the service,  
program to the process the IO transfer and then  return to the task it was originally performing   
Direct Memory Access- the data transfer between  a fast storage media, such as magnetic disk and  
memory unit is limited by the speed of the CPU  Thus, we can allow the peripherals directly  
communicate with each other using the memory  buses, removing the intervention of the CPU   
This type of data transfer technique is known  as DMA or Direct Memory Access  During DMA the  
CPU is ideal and it has no control over the  memory buses  The DMA controller takes over  
transfer information without altering it between  the external world, and one or more internal  
Welcome
But, with a tablet one can easily point to a region with the stylus using the kinesthetic
sense, informally known as "muscle memory "
Transfer function- It device in combination with the host operating system typically modifies
its signals using a mathematical transformation 
That scales the data to provide smooth efficient and intuitive operation 
An appropriate mapping is a transfer function that matches the physical properties sensed
by the input device 
Appropriate mappings include force to velocity, position to position and velocity to velocity functions 
For example, an isometric joystick senses force, a nonlinear rate mapping transfers
this into a velocity of cursor movement, ideally the device should also be self centric 
Input and Output Devices- An input device sends information to a computer system for
When using a rate mapping with spring returned to the zero input value, so that the user
can stop quickly by releasing the device 
A common inappropriate mapping is calculating the speed of scrolling based on the position
of the mouse cursor, such as extending a selected region by dragging the mouse close to the
edge of the screen 
The user has no feedback off when to or what extent scrolling will accelerate, and the
resulting interaction can be hard to learn, how to use and difficult to control 
A symbol multiplicative transfer function is known as the device gain, which can also
be described as a control to display that is CD ratio 
The ratio between the moment of the input device and the corresponding moment of the
processing, and an output device reproduces or displays the results of that processing 
object it controls 
Number of dimension- devices can measure one or more linear and angular dimensions 
For example, a mouse measures two linear dimensions, and knob measures one angular dimension 
And a six degree of freedom, six d of magnetic trackers measure three linear dimensions and
three angular dimension 
If the number of dimensions required by the users interaction task does not match the
number of dimensions provided by the input device, special handling mechanisms are to
be introduced 
This may include extra buttons graphically gets more switching etcetera 
Pointing speed and accuracy- The standard way to characterize pointing device performance
Computer input is called data and the output obtained after processing it, based on user's
employs the fit slow paradigm 
Fit slow relates the moment time to a point at a target, the amplitude of the moment there
is a distance to the target and the width of the target, that is the precision requirement
of the pointing moment 
The moment time is proportional to the logarithm of the distance divided by the target width,
with constant terms that vary from one device to another 
Input device states- to select a single point or region with an input device users need
a way to signal, when they are selecting something versus when they are just moving over something
to reach a desired target 
The need for this fundamental signal of intention is often forgotten by researchers eager to
instructions is called information 
explore new interaction modalities, such as the empty handed pointing, example, using
camera tracking or non contacting proximity sensing of hand position 
The three state model of input generalizes the state censored by input devices as tracking,
which causes the cursor to move drag, which allows selection of objects by clicking as
well as moving objects by clicking and dragging them 
And out of range which occurs when the device moves out of its physical tracking range 
Example, mouse is lifted from the dust or the stylus is removed from a tablet, most
pointing device sense only two of these three states 
For example, a mouse senses tracking and dragging, but a touchpad senses tracking and the out
of range state 
Raw facts and figures which can be processed using arithmetic and logical operations to
Hence, to fully simulate the functionality offered by mice, touchpad’s needs special
procedures such as tapping to click which are browned to in advance activation 
Example, touching the pad by accident causes a click 
Direct versus indirect control- A mouse is an indirect input device, one must move the
mouse to point to a spot on the screen 
It touch screens a direct input device, that is the display surface also the input surface 
Direct devices raise several unique issues 
Designers must consider the possibility of parallax error resulting from a gap between
the input and display surfaces, reduced transmissivity of the screen introduced by a sensing layer,
or occlusion of the display by the user's hands 
obtain information are called data 
Another issue is that it’s screen can support a cursor tracking state or a dragging state,
but not both 
Typically touchscreens move directly from the out of way range stayed to the dragging
state, when the user touches the screen with no intermediate cursor feedback 
Device acquisition time- the average time to pick up or put down an input device is
known as acquisition time or sometimes homing time 
It is often assumed to be a significant factor for user performance, however, one exemption
is stylus or pen based input devices 
Pens are generally comparable to mice in general pointing performance 
Modeling of Repetitive tasks- The Keystroke Level Model KLM is commonly used to model
Some input devices are graphics tablets, cameras, video capture hardware, trackballs, barcode readers, digital camera, gamepad,
expert user performance in repetitive tasks, such as text editing 
The KLM includes standard operators that represent average times required for pointing with an
input device 
Pressing a button, posses for a decision making and device acquisition time, but the model
does not account for errors or not expert behavior, such as problem solving 
Hardware criteria- Various other characteristics can distinguish input devices, but are perhaps
less important in distinguishing the fundamental types of interaction techniques that can be supported 
Engineering parameters of a device's performance such as sampling rate, resolution, accuracy,
and linearity can all influence performance 
Latency is the end-to-end delay between the user’s physical moment sensing this and
joystick, keyboard, microphone,MIDI keyboard, mouse, scanner, webcam,
providing the ultimate system feedback to the user 
Latency can be a devious problem as it is impossible to completely eliminate from system
performance, latency of more than seventy to hundred milliseconds significantly impairs
user performance for many interactive tasks 
Device modes of IO Data Transfer- Data transfer between the central unit and IO devices can
be handled in generally three types of modes, which are given below 
Programmed IO, interrupt initiated IO and direct memory access 
Programmed IO instructions- Programmed IO instructions are the result of IO instructions
written in computer program 
Each data item transfer is initiated by the instruction in the program 
touchpad’s, pen inputs, microphone, electronic whiteboard,
Usually the program controls data transfer to and from CPU and peripheral 
Transferring the data under programmed IO requires constant monitoring of the peripherals
by the CPU 
Interrupt initiated IO- in the programmed IO method, the CPU stays in the program loop
until the IO unit indicates that it is ready for data transfer 
This is a time consuming process because it keeps the processor busy needlessly 
This problem can be overcome by using interrupt initiated IO 
In this when the interface determines that the peripheral is ready for data transfer,
it generates an interrupt 
After receiving the interrupt signal, the CPU stops the task, which is processing and
OMR, OCR, punch card reader, MICR and magnetic tape drive 
service the IO transfer and returns back to its previous processing tasks 
Direct Memory Access- Removing an CPU from the path and letting the peripheral device
manage the memory, buses directly would improve the speed of transfer 
This technique is known as DMA 
In this the interface transferred data to and from the memory, through memory bus 
A DMA controller manages to transfer data between peripherals and memory unit 
Many hardware systems use DMA such as disk drives controllers, graphic cards, network
cards and sound cards etcetera 
It is also used for intra chip data transfer in multi-core processors 
In DMA, CPU would initiate the transfer do other operations, by the transfer is in progress 
Output the results produced by the central processing unit, is a computer’s whole reason
And receive an interrupt from the DMA controller, when the transfer has been completed 
User Interface Transactions- Early efforts in human computer interaction sought to identify
elemental task, that appear repeatedly in human computer dialogues 
User interface transactions are composed of the following elemental task 
Selection- Choosing objects from a set of alternatives 
Position- Specify a position within a range, this includes picking a screen coordinate
with a pointing device 
Orient- Specifying an angle or three-dimensional orientation 
Path- Specifying a series of positions and or orientations over time 
Quantify- Specifying an exact numeric value 
for being 
Text- Entry of symbolic data 
IO module- IO module is intermediate between IO devices and CPU 
System buses are connected to the one end of IO module, and other end is connected to
the number of IO devices 
It is used to exchange information between IO devices and CPU 
IO devices cannot be directly connected to the system buses, they are connected to the
system buses through module 
There are several reasons for not connecting IO devices, directly to the system buses and
they are as follows 
Variety of IO devices are available with different operation method 
Output is usable information that is raw input data that has been processed by the computer
It was not possible to develop operation logic of each IO devices in the CPU list 
The IO devices are much slower than the CPU 
Hence it is not possible to match the high speed of CPU with the speed of IO devices 
As IO devices are made with different operation methods, some of them uses different data formats 
It was impractical to integrate each data format in the CPU 
Thus, IO module is used to match speed, operation method and data format between CPU and IO devices 
Functions of IO module- the major functions of modules are categorized as follows 
Control and Timing- In some of the IO operation few resources share such as CPU and memory,
because CPU communicates with more than one device at a time 
Control and timing function synchronizes data flow between IO devices and internal resources,
into information 
such as memory and CPU 
Processor communication- IO module communicates with the CPU and IO devices, it performs following steps 
Status inquiry of IO device from IO module, IO module accepts data from IO device and
transfers it to the CPU 
Device Communication- In addition, IO module communicates with IO devices 
Feature of IO module, Data Buffering- As IO devices are much slower than CPU and memory 
In order to maintain speed of data flow between IO devices and internal resources, IO module
buffers data 
Device can access buffered data any time without holding system bus 
Error Detection- It is built-in feature of IO module that detects electrical and mechanical errors 
The most common forms of outputs are words, numbers and graphics 
IO drivers and Controllers- All peripherals require driver software, which enables the
OS to command the hardware 
When a peripheral device is added that is new to the computer, a controller card is
plugged in and a driver is installed 
Every peripheral device such as keyboard, modem, monitor etcetera requires a control
unit that interfaces with the computer’s processor that is the CPU 
These circuits are either built into the chips on the motherboard or are contained on plug-in cards 
The input or output controller is a device that interfaces between an input or output
device and the hardware device 
The input output controller on a computer is commonly located on the motherboard 
Word output for example may be the letters and memos prepared by office people using
However, an IO controller can also be an internal add-on that can either be used as replacement
or allow for addition input or output devices for the computer 
The device controller works like an interface between a device and a device driver 
IO units such as keyboard, mouse, printer etcetera, typically consists of a mechanical
component and an electric component, where electric component is called the device controller 
There is always a device controller and the device driver for each device to communicate
with the operating system 
A device controller maybe able to handle multiple devices, as an interface it’s main task
is to convert serial mid-stream to block of bytes, perform error correction as necessary 
Now, let us summarize the session 
word processing software 
Input output deice is any hardware used by a human operator or other systems to communicate
with a computer 
As the name indicates input output devices are capable of sending data or output to a
computer, and receiving data from a computer input 
The way system manages different types of inputs and outputs depend on the IO system 
Here an overview of the IO devices and the system is given to get an idea about the different
types of input devices 
The connection ports used to connect different peripherals, the mode of data transmission etcetera 
The session ends with an introduction to IO drivers and IO monitors 
Hope you enjoyed this session, see you next time, bye 
Other workers may be more interested in numbers such as those found in formulas, schedules and budgets 
In many cases numbers can be understood more easily, when output in the form of charts
and graphics 
A computer is an electronic machine that accepts data from the user, processes the data by
Some output devices are monitors, printers, plotters, projectors, LCD projection panels,
computer output microfilm, speakers, head phones, visual display unit, film recorder
and microfiche 
Connection ports- port is a connecting socket outside the system, into which different types
of cables are plugged 
It is a specific place from which other devices can be physically connected 
IO ports are the interfaces through which computers communicate with external devices,
such as printers, modems, joysticks and terminals 
There are many types of ports used in computer system, some of them are given as follows 
Parallel port- Various peripherals can be connected through parallel port, which is
performing calculations and operations on it, and generates the desired output results 
a parallel communication physical interface 
A parallel port transmits eight bits of a byte of data in parallel, it is used for transmitting
fast data over short distances 
It is used to connect a printer to a computer, since a parallel port transmits an end a byte
at a time, it operates IO devices at a relatively high speed 
A parallel port is primarily used to connect printers to a computer and hence it is often
called a printer port 
Serial port- Serial port transmits one bit of a byte, one at a time single streams of bits 
It is meant for transmitting slower data over long distances, communication over a phone
is an example of serial communication 
A computer system consists of both hardware and information stored on hardware 
It is a serial communication physical interface which transmits one bit at a time, dial-up
modems and serial mice use serial ports 
Universal Serial Bus or USB- A USB port can connect up to one twenty seven peripheral
devices such as a digital camera, digital speakers, scanners, speaker’s etcetera 
It permits plug and play which means that configuration of expansion cards and peripheral
devices as and when they are installed 
Small Computer System Interface or SCSI Port- SCSI that is Small Computer System Interface
port allows data to be transmitted in a daisy chain up to seven devices at a speed higher
thirty two bits at a time, than those possible with serial and parallel ports 
It is a fast data transmitting device and is used to connect HDD, CD-ROM drivers and
Information stored on computer hardware is often called software 
scanners with the computer system 
IO device types- An IO system is required to take an input request from some application
and send it to the physical device 
Then take whatever response comes back from the device and send it to the application 
IO device can be divided into two categories 
Block devices- A block device is one with which the driver software communicates by
sending n their blocks of data 
For example, hard-disk, USB cameras, disk on key etcetera 
Character devices- A character device is one with which the driver communicates by sending
and receiving single characters by its optics etcetera 
The hardware components of a computer system are the electronic and mechanical parts 
For example, serial ports, parallel ports, sound cards etcetera 
External devices- IO operations are accomplished through external devices that provide a means
of exchanging data between external environment and computer 
An external device attaches to the computer by a link to an IO module, an external device
link to an IO module is called peripheral device or peripheral 
External device can be categorized as human readable and machine readable, human readable
means suitable for communicating with computer user 
For example, video display terminals and printers, machine readable are suitable for communicating
with equipment 
For example, sensor, actuators used in robotics applications 
The software components of a computer system are the data and the computer programs 
Communication suitable for communicating with remote devices, they maybe human readable
device, such as terminal and machine readable device, such as in other computer 
Properties of devices- The number and types of input devices and output devices available
in the market today can be completely confusing 
Fortunately, there are number of organizing properties and principles, which can help
to make sense of the design space and performance issues 
Physical Property Sensed- Traditional pointing devices typically sense position, motion,
or force 
A tablet senses position, a mouse measures motion that is change in position, and an
isometric joystick senses force 
The major hardware components of a computer system are processor, main memory, secondary
An isometric joystick is a self-centering force sensing joystick such as the IBM TrackPoint
"eraser-head" found on many laptops 
For a rotary device the corresponding properties are angles, change in angle and torque 
Position sensing devices are also known as absolute input devices, whereas motion sensing
devices are relative input device 
An absolute device can fully support relative motion, since it can calculate changes to
position, but, a relative device cannot fully support absolute positioning 
And in fact can only emulate position at all by introducing a cursor on the screen 
Note that it is difficult to move the mouse cursor to a particular area of the screen
other than the edges without looking at the screen 
memory, input devices and output devices 
Welcome
like the new curved displays that are being released 
Touch Screen Monitors- Touch Screen Monitors are used for input as well as output 
A touch screen is a special type of visual display until it has a grid of light beams
of fine wires on the screen 
It lets the user to interact with a computer by the touch of a finger rather than typing
on a keyboard or moving a mouse 
The user can enter data by touching icons or menus identified on the screen 
Most touch screen computers use sensors to detect touch of a finger 
Touch screen is well suited for simple applications like ATM 
It has also become common in department stores and supermarkets 
plotters, etcetera 
Types of Touch Screen monitors - There are different types of touch screen technology 
The most common types are resistive, surface wave and capacitive 
Resistive Touch Screen- This monitor usually has a chord of thin electrically conductive
and resistive layer of metal 
A change in electrical current occurs when it is pressed 
The input can be processed by a computer 
These monitors are the most popular types of touchscreen monitors used today 
They are usually not affected by dust or liquids, which make them very reliable 
Surface Wave Touch Screen- These monitors use ultrasonic waves to process input from the screen 
These waves flow over the touch screen, the wave is absorbed and processed by computer
Monitors- Monitors, commonly called as visual display unit, or VDU are the main output device
when a person touches the pad 
Capacitive Touch Screen- These screens are coated with indium tin oxide 
This material provides continuous current across the screen 
The current can be measured by the processor when the pad is touched 
It is usually used with a bad finger instead of stylus 
These screens have high clarity and are not affected by dust 
Nowadays, most of the smartphones have capacitive touch screens 
Printer- A computer printer is a device or an instrument that must be connected to a
computer, which allows users to print text and graphics on the plain papers 
In some cases, they can be directly connected to digital camera for printing pictures without
of a computer 
connecting to any computer 
Computer printer is one of the essential hardware whether it is for a large company or for personal use 
The usage of printer is depend upon the requirement of the company or individual person 
Printers can be divided into two main categories- impact printers and non-impact printers 
Impact printers- An Impact Printer makes contact with the paper 
It usually forms the print image by pressing an inked ribbon against the paper using a
hammer or pins 
Following are some of examples of impact printers 
Dot- Matrix printers- The dot matrix printer uses print heads containing from nine to twenty-four pins 
These pins produce patterns of dots on the paper to form the individual characters 
It forms images from tiny dots called pixels that are arranged in a rectangular form 
The twenty-four-pin dot matrix printer produces more dots than a nine-pin dot matrix printer
which results in much better quality and clearer characters 
The general rule is the more pins the clearer the letters on the paper 
The pins strike the ribbon individually, as the print mechanism moves across the entire
print line in both directions 
That is from left to right, then right to left and so on 
The user can produce a colour output with a Dot matrix printer 
The user will change the black ribbon with a ribbon that has colour stripes 
Dot- Matrix printers are inexpensive and typically print at speeds of hundred to six hundred
characters per second 
The sharpness of the image depends upon the number of pixels 
Daisy- wheel Printers- The heart of the system is an interchangeable metal or plastic daisy-wheel
holding an entire character set as raised characters moulded on each petal 
In order to get the quality of type found in typewriters a daisy- wheel impact printer
can be used 
It is called daisy-wheel printer because the print mechanism looks like a daisy as at the
end of each petal is a fully formed character which produces solid line print 
A hammer strikes a petal containing a character against the ribbon and the character prints
on the paper 
The speed of the printer is typically low with twenty-five to fifty-five characters per second 
Line Printers- In business, where enormous amount of materials are printed, the character
The size of the monitor we use truly depends on our preference 
at a time printers are too slow 
Therefore, these users need line at a time printers 
Line printers or line at a time printers use special mechanisms that can print a whole
line at once 
They can typically print the range of thousand two hundred to six thousand lines per minute 
Drum, Chain and Band printers are line at a time printers 
Drum printer- A drum printer consists of a solid cylindrical drum that has raised characters
in bands on its surface 
The number of print positions across the drum equals the number available on the page 
This number typically ranges from eighty to one thirty-two print positions 
Things to consider are our eyesight, who else will be using it and the distance the monitor
The drum rotates at a rapid speed 
For each possible print position, there is a print hammer located behind the paper 
These hammers strike the paper along the ink ribbon against the proper character on the
drum as it passes 
One revolution of the drum is required to print each line 
This means that all characters on the line are not printed at exactly the same time,
but the time required to print the entire line is fast enough to call them as line printers 
Typically, speeds of drum printers are in the range of three hundred to two thousand
lines per minute 
Chain printers- A chain printer uses a chain of print characters wrapped around to pulleys 
will be sitting away from us 
Like the drum printer, there is one hammer for each print position 
Circuitry inside the printer detects when the correct character appears at the desired
print location on the page 
The hammer then strikes the page pressing the paper against a ribbon and the character
located at the desired print position 
An impression of the character is left on the page 
The chain keeps rotating until all the required print positions on the line have filled 
Then the page moves up to print the next line 
Speed of the chain printers range from four hundred to two thousand five hundred characters
per minute 
There are monitors sizes ranging from seven inches as a supplementary peripheral, but
Non-impact Printers- Non- impact printers do not use a striking device to produce characters
on the paper 
And because these printers do not hammer against the paper, they are much quieter 
Following are some non-impact printers 
Ink-jet printers- Ink-jet printers work in the same fashion as Dot- matrix printers in
the form of images or characters with little dots 
However, the dots are formed by tiny droplets of ink 
Ink-jet printers form characters on paper by spraying ink from tiny nozzles through
an electrical field that arranges the charged ink particles into characters at the rate
of approximately two fifty characters per second 
normal monitors range from a seventeen-inch diagonal to a monster fifty-five-inch diagonal 
to the session on output devices 
The ink is absorbed into the paper and dries instantly 
Various colours of ink can also be used 
One or more nozzles in the printhead emits a steady stream of ink drops 
Droplets of ink are electrically charged after leaving the nozzle 
The droplets are then guided to the paper by electrically charged deflecting plates 
One plate has positive charge upper plate, and the other has negative charge which is
the lower plate 
A nozzle for black ink may be all that's needed to print text 
But full colour printing is also possible with the addition three extra nozzles for
cyan, magenta and yellow primary colours 
Monochrome Monitor- A monochrome monitor is a type of CRT computer display, which was
If a droplet isn't needed for the character or image being formed, it is recycled back
to its input nozzle 
Several manufacturers produce colour inkjet printers 
Some of these printers come with all the colour inks in the cartridge 
If you want to replace one colour, you must replace all the colours 
Other colour inkjet printers allow you to replace ink individually 
These printers are a better choice, if user uses one colour more than other colours 
These printers produce less noise and print in better quality with greater speed 
Laser Printers- A Laser printer works like a photocopy machine 
Laser Printers produce images on paper by directing a laser beam at a mirror which bounces
very common in the early days of computing from the nineteen sixties through the nineteen
the beam into a drum 
The drum has a special coating on it to which toner, which is an ink powder sticks 
Using patterns of small dots, a laser beam conveys information from the computer to a
positively charged drum to become neutralized 
From all these areas of drum, which become neutralized, the toner detaches 
As the paper rolls by the drum the toner is transferred to the paper printing the letter
or other graphics on the paper 
A hot roller bonds the toner to the paper 
Laser Printers use buffers that store an entire page at a time 
When a whole page is loaded, it will be printed 
eighties, before colour monitors became popular 
The speed of laser printers is high and they print quietly without producing much noise 
Many home-use laser printers can print eight pages per minute 
But faster and print approximately twenty-one thousand lines per minute, or four thirty-seven
pages per minute, if each page contains forty-eight lines 
When high speed laser printers were introduced, they were expensive 
Developments in the last few years have provided relatively low-cost laser printers for use
in small businesses 
Plotter- A plotter is a printer designed for printing vector graphics 
Instead of printing individual dots on the paper, plotters draw continuous lines 
This makes plotters ideal for printing architectural blueprints, engineering designs and other
They are still widely used in applications such as computerized cash register systems 
CAD drawings 
There are two main types of plotters, Drum and Flatbed plotters 
Drum plotters, also called Roller plotters, spin the paper back and forth on a cylindrical
drum while the ink pens move left and right 
By combining these two directions, lines can be drawn in any direction 
Flatbed plotters have a large horizontal surface on which the paper is placed 
A traveling bar draws lines on the paper as it moves across the surface 
Most drum and flatbed plotters provide output sizes that are much larger than standard inkjet
and laser printers 
For example, a typical ink-jet printer creates documents that are eight point five inches wide 
Monochrome monitors actually display two colours, one for the background and one for the foreground 
A drum plotter may produce documents that are forty-four inches wide 
The length of a document printed by a drum plotter is only limited by the size of the paper 
Documents printed by flatbed plotters are constrained to the length and width of the
printing surface 
Hope you enjoyed this session 
See you next time 
Bye 
The colours can be black and white, green and black or amber and black 
Colour monitor- Colour monitors can display anywhere from sixteen to over one million
different colours 
Colour monitors are sometimes called RGB monitors, because they accept three separate signals
red, green and blue 
An output device is any peripheral that receives data from a computer, usually for display,
Features of monitors - Size- Monitors are available in different sizes 
The standard monitor for personal computers is thirteen to sixteen inches 
The size of the monitor is measured diagonally 
Resolution- Resolution of a monitor is the number of pixels on the screen 
It is the image sharpness of a display screen 
It is expressed as a matrix 
A resolution of six forty by four eighty means there is six forty horizontal pixels and four
eighty vertical pixels 
The actual resolution is determined by the video controller, not by monitor 
Most monitors provide the resolutions of six forty by four eighty, eight hundred by six
projection or physical reproduction 
hundred, and thousand twenty-four by seven sixty-eight 
Refresh rate- The number of times the electron guns scan every pixel on the screen in one
second is called refresh rate 
It is measured in hertz or cycles per second 
Dot Pitch- The distance between the phosphorus dots that create a single pixel is called
a Dot Pitch 
Types of monitors- There are two kinds of viewing screen used for monitors, Cathode
Ray Tube, CRT and flat panel display 
Cathode Ray Tube or CRT monitor- The CRT display is made up of small picture elements called pixels 
The smaller the pixels, the better the image clarity or resolution 
For example, an ink-jet printer is an output device that can make a hard copy of any information
It takes more than one illuminated pixel to form a whole character such as the letter
E in the word 'help' 
A finite number of characters can be displayed on a screen at once 
The screen can be divided into a series of character boxes fixed the location on the
screen, where a standard character can be placed 
Most screens are capable of displaying eighty characters of data horizontally and twenty-five
lines vertically 
While CRT monitors can still be found in some organizations, many offices have stopped using
them largely because, they are heavy, bulky and costly to replace, should they break 
While they are still in use, it would be a good idea to face these monitors out for cheaper,
shown on your monitor, which is another example of an output device 
lighter and more reliable monitors 
Flat panel display monitor- The flat panel display refers to a class of video devices
that have reduced volume, weight and power requirement in comparison to the CRT 
You can hang them on walls or wear them on your wrist 
Current uses of flat-panel displays include calculators, video games, monitors, laptop
computers, and graphic displays 
The flat-panel display is divided into two categories 
Emissive displays- Emissive displays are devices that convert electrical energy into light 
For example, plasma panel and LED that is light emitting diodes 
Non-Emissive displays- Non emissive displays use optical effects to convert sunlight or
A computer can still work without an output device 
light from some other sources into graphics patterns 
For example, LCD, Liquid Crystal Devices 
LCD monitors- The LCD monitor or liquid crystal monitor incorporates one of the most advanced
technologies available today 
Typically, it consists of a layer of colour or monochrome pixels arranged schematically
between a couple of transparent electrodes and two polarizing filters 
Optical effect is made possible by polarizing the light in varied amounts and making it
pass through the liquid crystal layer 
The two types of LCD technology available are the active matrix of TFT and the passive matrix
technology 
However, without an output device, no way of determining what the computer is doing,
TFT generates better picture quality and is more secure and reliable 
Passive matrix on the other hand has slower response time and it is slowly becoming outdated 
The advantages of LCD monitors include their compact size, which makes them lightweight 
They also don't consume much electricity as CRT monitors, and can be run off of batteries,
which makes them ideal for laptops 
Images transmitted by these monitors don't get geometrically distorted and have little thicker 
However, this type of monitor does have disadvantages such as its relatively high price, and image
quality, which is not constant when viewed from different angles, and the monitor resolution
that is not always constant, meaning any alterations can result in reduced performance 
LED or light emitting diode monitors- LED monitors are the latest type of monitors on
if there are errors, or if it needs additional input 
the market today 
These are flat panel or slightly curved displays, which make use of light emitting diodes for
backlighting instead of cold cathode fluorescent CCFL backlighting used in LCDs 
LED monitors are set to use much lesser power than CRT and LCD and are considered far more
environmentally friendly 
The advantages of LED monitors are that they produce images with the higher contrast, have
less negative environmental impact when disposed, are more durable than CRT or LCD monitors
and features a very thin design 
They also don't produce much heat while running 
The only downside is that they can be more expensive, especially for the high-end monitors
Following are some of the important output devices used in a computer- monitors, printers,
Welcome back 
Another feature present in this generation was time sharing technique, a variant of multi
programming technique in which each user has an online that is directly connected terminal 
Because the user is present and interacting with one computer, the computer system must
respond quickly to user requests, otherwise, the throughput could be low 
Time sharing systems were developed to multi program large number of simultaneous interactive uses 
Fourth generation- With the development of large-scale integration circuits, operating
system became a user-friendly software 
Multi-processor technology evolved to the point that, it become possible to build desktop
computers as powerful as the mainframes of the nineteen seventies 
Two operating systems have dominated the personal computers such as MS DOS, written by Microsoft,
It also acts as a resource manager, which takes care of the various resources such as
and for the IBM PC and other machines using the Intel eight-zero-eight- eight CPU and
its successors, and Unix, which is dominant on the large personal computers using the
Motorola six-eight-nine-nine CPU family 
As the successor to MS DOS, Microsoft produced a GUI based system called Windows 
From nineteen eighty-five to nineteen ninety-five, windows was just a graphical environment on
top of MS DOS 
But Windows ninety-five was released as a free-standing version of Windows that incorporated
many operating system features into one 
There were several modifications for this version such as Windows ninety-eight, Windows
NT for new technology and Windows Me for Millennium edition 
process, memory, device information, etcetera 
Linux is becoming another popular operating system now 
Another development was the network operating system and the distributed operating system 
In a network operating system, the users are aware of the existence of multiple computers
and the users can log in to remote machines as and when needed 
But a distributed operating system appears to its users as a unique processor system,
but actually consists of multiple processors 
Operating System Architecture- A typical computer system consists of different types of software 
There are different schemes for classifying the types of software used for a computer system 
One such division is based on the task which they are performing 
There are different components which constitute an operating system, each performing a well-defined
There are different examples for operating systems 
task for the overall performance of the operating system 
Here, we will have a discussion on these topics 
Types of Softwares- A machine software is broadly divided into two categories such as
Application Software and System
Software  Application software consists of the programs for particular tasks such as database systems,
desktop publishing systems, accounting systems, program development, software, and games 
System Software is used to perform the tasks which are common to computer systems 
It supports the application software by providing the infrastructure required for application
software to do their jobs 
System Software is of two types 
Some of them are Windows, Unix, Linux, and MacOS 
One is operating system, and the other is a collection of software called a Utility software 
Utility software consists of software units that extend the capabilities of the operating system 
By implementing certain activities, utility software allows system software to be customized
to the needs of a particular installation more easily than if they were included in
the operating system 
The software classification is given in the figure 
Components of the operating system- The operating system provides the environment for the users
to communicate with the machine and it controls the various resources associated with the
computer system 
Most operating systems are made up of a number of functionally separate pieces that together
History and evolution of operating systems- History of operating systems is very much
comprises the operating system 
The view of an operating system is as follows 
Kernel- The internal part of an operating system is called the kernel 
And operating systems kernel contains those software components that perform the very
basic functions required by the computer installation 
The kernel is responsible for managing the other system programs 
It can be thought of as upper management, which oversees the whole process of operating
the computer system 
The process involves the integration of the hardware and software 
File manager is one such unit whose job is to coordinate the use of the machine's mass
dependent upon the history of computers itself 
storage facilities 
Shell- In order to perform the actions requested by the computer's users, an operating system
must be able to communicate with the users 
The shell is an environment designed to allow a user to manipulate the system 
The operating system handles the communication using the shell 
It is the command interpreter between user and the system 
Modern shells perform this task by means of a graphical user interface or GUI in which
objects to be manipulated are pictorially represented on the monitor as icons 
These systems allow users to issue commands to the operating system by pointing to these
icons with the help of mouse or such pointing devices 
The computers of the nineteen forties and nineteen fifties were not very flexible or
Older shells communicate with users through textual messages using keyboard and monitor screen 
Some operating system allows a user to select among different shells to obtain most compatible
interface for that particular user 
Types of user interface - The part of the operating system that provides the way for
the human to communicate with the machine is called the Human Computer Interface, HCI
or more often the user interface UI 
The operating system can be categorized according to its interface 
UIs generally fall into three types viz 
Command line, menu based and graphical 
Command Line user interface- Keyboard is used to communicate with the operating system and
much efficient 
the computer 
In the command line UI, the user types in commands and the computer responds to them 
Here the problem is that because computer must receive their instructions in very precise
ways, the user is required to type the commands in a very specific format called Syntax 
Example Unix and DOS 
Menu based Interface- Menu based user interfaces are not common in operating systems 
Menus can simplify the use of a command line user interface, by providing a list of commands
from which to choose 
The user selects the menu item by typing an identifier or by clicking with a mouse 
Then the menu-based UI types the complete and correct syntax for the user 
Machines occupied the entire rooms 
Graphical User Interface- Graphical user interface commonly referred to as GUI, is really a very
sophisticated form of menu-based interface 
Instead of listing the command, it represents them as a number of small pictures called icons 
For example, Windows and MacOS
Future User Interfaces- One of the first changes will probably be the introduction of a voice
operated UI, which uses voice commands instead of typing or using click the commands 
Another is the adoption of three-dimensional look for user interface 
Structure of operating system- The structure of an operating system is a highly complex one 
To reduce the complexity operating systems are usually referred and implemented in terms
of hierarchy of layers 
Program execution required significant preparation of equipments like, mounting magnetic tapes,
In this module, we are going to discuss about the operating system 
This approach is an outgrowth of the concept of information hiding 
Externally a module is not to perform a specific function on objects of a given time 
It is given in the figure Layer one, kernel- Typical mechanisms contained in the operating
systems are processor management mechanism, interrupt processing mechanism, memory management
mechanism, IO mechanism, communication mechanism 
Layer two, basic Input Output- Low level facilities for management of secondary storage needed
to support the main memory management 
Layer three, Memory Management- Manages primary memory and the version memory can be implemented
at this level 
Layer four, File System- It has the facilities for storage and manipulation of named files 
placing punched cards in card readers, etcetera 
Layer five, Command Language Interpreter- It provides an interface between interactive
users and operating system 
These input lines are then passed to separate commands from parameters and to identify the
type of service required 
Bootstrapping or booting- Booting is a bootstrapping process that starts operating system, when
the user turns on a computer system 
A boot sequence is the initial set of operations that the computer performs when power is switched on 
The boot loader typically loads the main operating system for the computer 
A computer central processor can only execute program code found in read only memory, random
access memory or from an operator's console 
The execution of each job was handled as an isolated activity like the machine was prepared
Modern operating systems and application program code and data are stored on non-volatile data
storage devices such as hard drives, CD, DVD, USB flash drive, and floppy disk 
When a computer is first powered on, that usually does not have an operating system
in ROM or RAM 
The computer must execute a relatively small program stored in ROM, along with a minimum
of data needed to access the non-volatile devices from which the operating system programs
in data are loaded into RAM 
The small program that starts this sequence of loading into RAM is known as a bootstrap
loader, bootstrap or boot loader 
This small boot loader program's only job is to load other data and programs which are
for executing, after execution all the tapes and cards to be removed before the next program
then executed from RAM 
Often multiple stage boot loaders are used during which several programs of increasing
complexity sequentially load one after the other in the process of chain loading 
Types of operating systems- The operating system is the most important software to run
a computer 
It is the one who takes care of everything on a computer system 
Operating systems can be branched into several different types, some of them are given below 
Batch Processing Operating System- In a batch processing operating system, interaction between
the user and processor is limited or there is no interaction at all during the execution
of work 
begin 
Data and programs that need to be processed are bundled and collected as a batch and executed
together 
Batch processing operating systems are most appropriate in situations like there are large
amounts of data to be processed or similar data needs to be processed or similar processing
is involved when executing the data 
The system is capable of identifying the idle times of the processor at which time batches
may be processed 
Processing performed automatically without any user intervention 
In a batch processing system, the memory is divided into two at any time, the system area
and the user area 
When the number of users is increased, signup sheets were issued to reserve the machine
In order to provide maximum space to the user program and overlay structure is used to store
the monitor program in the system area 
A memory protection mechanism is used to ensure that user jobs does not corrupt the batch
monitor court 
Multi programming operating system- It has the interleaved execution of two or more different
and independent programs by the same computer 
The goal is to improve the system utilization by exploiting the concurrency between the
CPU and the IO subsystem 
The basic idea is that while the IO subsystem is busy with an IO operation, for one usage
job, the CPU can execute another user job 
for blocks of time 
Since the operating speed of the CPU is much higher than that of IO operations, the CPU
can allocate time to several programs instead of remaining idle 
The number of programs actively competing for system resources of a multi programming
system is called the degree of multi programming 
Types of multi programming systems- One is multitasking 
In this type of operating system, several applications may be simultaneously loaded
and used in the memory 
While the processor handles only one application at a particular time, it is capable of switching
between the applications effectively to execute each application 
This type of operating system is seen everywhere today, and is the most common type of operating system 
During the time allocated for a user, the machine was totally under that user's control 
Example Windows operating system
Another is multi user 
This type of operating system allows multiple users to simultaneously use the system 
The processor splits its resources and handles one user at a time 
The speed and efficiency at which it does this makes it apparent that users are simultaneously
using the system 
Some network systems utilize this kind of operating system 
Yet another type is multi-processor 
These types of operating systems manage the operations of computer systems that incorporate
multiple processes 
In such an environment operating system began systems for simplifying program setup and
Time sharing operating system- Multi programming operating systems are not suitable for interactive
type applications where the user directly interacts with the computer system 
Time sharing concept was introduced to provide fast response time to interactive users of
a computer system 
To provide good response times to all users, the time-sharing supervisor should ensure
that no programs should be allowed to monopolize the CPU 
Two provisions are made to ensure this 
One is programs are not assigned fixed priorities 
And the second, a program can only consume a limited amount of CPU time in one go 
Real time operating system- A real time operating system processes inputs simultaneously fast
the transition between jobs 
enough to affect the next input or process 
Real time systems are usually used to to control complex systems that require a lot of processing
like machinery and industrial systems 
These systems are characterized by having time as a key factor 
If the action must occur at a certain moment, the system is known as hard real time system 
In a soft real-time system missing an occasional deadline is acceptable 
To use a computer as a system, it should have a user interface to communicate with the hardware 
A operating system is the one which takes care of the entire computer system 
More than an interface to the hardware, it controls the various resources associated
with it 
As a first step, physical transition of people in and out of the computer room was eliminated 
Operating system is the software, which coordinates a computer's internal activities and controls
In this module, an overview of the operating system is presented it refers to the history
various components and the structure of an operating system 
This module also covers the different types, user interfaces of the operating system as well 
This module ends with a reference to the various types of operating system

Until then, bye
Anyone requiring a program run, was to submit it along with any required data and directions 
The operator load these materials into the machine storage and a program called operating
system will execute them one at a time 
Starting from there, now the operating system is of different varieties such as multi-user,
multitasking, real time network or distributed 
Relationship of operating system to basic hardware is given in the figure 
Here the main functions of operating systems such as memory management, processor management,
device management and information management interacts with the actual hardware of the computer 
Without any software, the computer can be treated as a bare machine, which means that
the overall operation of a computer 
it constitutes only the hardware components that cannot be fruitfully used by a user 
First generation- The first-generation computers used vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic
drums for memory and were very large in size, taking up entire rooms 
They were very expensive to operate 
These computers used great amount of electricity and generated a lot of heat, which often resulted
in malfunctions 
In these days, a single group of people designed, built, programmed, operated and maintained
each machine 
All programming was done in machine language, using plug boards and wires to control the
basic functions 
It is a collection of system programs that allow the user to run program software 
Hence, the need of operating systems was not even thought of 
All the problems were straight numerical calculations for doing sines, cosines, and logarithmic
operations 
By nineteen fifties, Punched Cards were introduced by which programs can be written on cards
and read them instead of using plug boards 
The UNIVAC and ENIAC computers are examples of first-generation computing devices 
Second generation- The use of transistors changed the picture of computer itself 
Computers could be manufactured and sold to paying customers 
To run a job, the programmer would first write the program on paper, then punch it on cards 
Then bring the card deck to the input room and hand it to one of the operators and wait
Without an operating system, a computer is only a raw machine, which cannot be used for
for a long time 
When the computer finished the job, the operator would go to the printer and get the output
to the output room so that, it can be collected by the programmer later 
So, the people who paid high costs for equipment looked for ways to reduce the wasted time 
The solution adopted was the batch system 
Second generation computers were largely used for scientific and engineering applications
using Fortran and assembly language 
Typical operating systems were Fortran Monitoring System, FMS and IBSYS which is IBM’s operating
system for the system seven zero nine four 
Third generation- By the early nineteen sixties, most of the computer manufacturers had two
any useful purposes 
incompatible product lines 
One type is a word oriented large-scale scientific computer such as seven zero nine four, which
were used for numerical calculations 
The other is the character oriented commercial computer like one four zero one, which were
widely used for tape sorting and printing by bands 
IBM introduced the system three sixty for solving both these problems 
The three sixty was a series of software compatible machines ranging from one four zero one size
to much more powerful than seven zero nine four 
Since all the machines had the same architecture and instruction set, programs written for
one machine could be run on all the others 
It provides the means by which a user can store and retrieve files and also an interface
IBM has compatible successors to the three sixty line known as three seventy, four-three-zero-zero,
three-zero-eight-zero, and three-zero-nine-zero series 
The systems of the nineteen sixties were also batch processing systems, but they were able
to take better advantage of the computer's resources by running several jobs at once 
So, operating system designers developed the concept of multi programming in which several
jobs are in main memory at once 
A processor is switched from job to job as needed to keep several jobs advancing while
keeping the peripheral devices in use 
For example, on the system with no multi programming, when the current job is waiting for other
IO operation to complete, the CPU has to sit idle until the IO finished 
by which a user can request the execution of programs 
The solution for this problem that evolved was to partition memory into several pieces
with a different job in each partition 
While one job was waiting for IO to complete, another job could be using the CPU 
Another major feature in third generation operating system was the technique called
spooling or simultaneous peripheral operations online 
In spooling, a high-speed device like a disk in the post between a running program and
the low speed device involved with the program in input or output 
Instead of writing directly to a printer, for example, outputs are returned to the disk 
Programs can run to completion faster, and other programs can be initiated sooner 
When the printer becomes available, the outputs may be printed 
It acts as an intermediate between a user and a computer 
Welcome back 
This module of the operating system is called the IO traffic controller 
Decide what is an efficient way to locate the IO devices, this is the job of the IO
scheduler 
Allocate the IO devices and initiate IO operation 
Information management- Many System calls excess for transferring information between
the user program and operating system 
The operating system keeps information about all its processes and there are system calls
to access this information 
Sometimes they will be call to reset the process information, files are abstract resources
of storage devices 
Operating system runs in kernel mode or supervisor mode and is protected from users by the hardware 
Information stored in main memory will be overwritten as soon as the memory is deallocated
from a process 
Information to be save must be copied to a storage device and information management
refers to a set of service used for storing, retrieving, modifying or removing information
on various devices 
As a part of information management the operating system performs the following actions,
keep track of the information, its location, use, status, etcetera, these collective facilities
are called file system, enforce protection requirements and provides access routines,
allocate information example, open a file, deallocate example, close a file 
Services of the operating system in this regard are create a file, create a directory, open and close a file,
Roles of an operating system - Without an Operating System a computer is little more
read data from file to buffer, write data from buffer to file, create a link
and change working directory, etcetera 
Processes- A process is a program in execution represented by the tuple, process ID, code,
data, register values and PC values 
The process is the smallest unit of work individually scheduled by an operating system 
An operating system creates a process in response to a request from the user to activate an
executable program 
Once created a process becomes active and eligible to compete for system resources such
as processor and IO devices the concept of program and process are different 
Process is a dynamic concept undergoing frequent state and attribute changes while an executable
than a bundle of plastic, metal and a few bits of expensive silicone 
program or job is a static process template that may give rise to one or more processes 
Implementation of a process- To implement the process model operating system maintains
a table called process table with one entry per process 
This entry contains information about the process state, its program counter, stack
pointer, memory allocation, the status of its open files, its accounting and scheduling
information, etcetera 
Although the exact <?>*</?> contained in the process table vary from system to system 
There will be some fields for process management, some for memory management and some other
for file management etcetera 
When a process is created, the operating system performs the following actions- Create a process
Most of the software runs on a computer but the operating system is the software that
control block for the process, assigns process ID and priority, allocates memory and other
resources to the process, set a process any environment, initialize resource accounting
information for the process 
Process control blocks- To keep track of all information concerning a process the operating
system groups all the information that it needs about a particular process into a data
structure called process descriptor or process control block or PCB 
Whenever a process is created the operating system creates a corresponding PCB to serve
its runtime description during the lifetime of the process 
When the process terminates its PCB is removed 
The PCB of process contains information concerning the following- Process scheduling information,
runs the computer 
information concerning memory and resource allocated, pointers to the next PCB in the
process scheduling list 
The process scheduling information consists of ID, priority, state and descriptions of
execution status 
This information is collectively called process status vector 
The structure of a PCB is given in the following figure 
Process States- A process can go through a series of discrete process takes 
The four general categories of process states are dormant or Hold, ready, running and blocked
or suspended 
The dormant state denotes processes that are not known to and therefore not tracked by
The operating system performs basically two unrelated task such as extending the machine
the operating system 
Inter process communication- Processes frequently need to communicate with other processes 
The communication between processes need to be in a well-structured way not using interrupts 
The cooperating process can communicate in a shared memory environment 
Another way to achieve the same is by the inter process communication or IPC facility
provided by the operating system 
IPC provides a mechanism to allow process to communicate and to synchronize their actions 
IPC is best provided by a message system 
The function of a message system is to allow processes to communicate with each other without
the need to restore the shared variables 
and managing resources 
Another is the indirect method in which messages are sent and received using mailboxes 
There are also some issues related to the inter process communication or IPC 
They are briefly discussed below 
First is race condition 
Processes working together often share some common storage that each one can read and write 
When two or more processes are reading or writing some share data and the final research
depend on who runs precisely when is called race condition 
For example, in the filesystems two or more programs may collide in their attempts to
modify or access a file which could results in data corruption 
File locking provides a commonly used solution 
The computer consists of processors, memories, timers, disks, network interfaces, printers, etcetera 
Critical sections- Race condition and many other troubles of IPC is due to the use of
shared memory and shared files 
So to avoid these problems there should be some mechanism to prohibit more than one process
from reading and writing the shared data at the same time 
The part of the program where the shared memory is accessed is called the critical section 
If we could have in mechanism to prevent any two processes from entering into their critical
sections at the same time race condition can be avoided 
The solution to the problem of race conditions need to have the following four conditions-
No two processes may be simultaneously inside their critical sections 
No assumptions may be made about the speed or the number of CPU cycles 
Hence, the job of the operating system is the controlled allocation of the various resources
No process running outside its critical section may block other processes 
No process should have to wait forever to enter its critical section 
Handling competition among process- An important task of an operating system is the allocation
of the machinery resources to the processes in the system 
Resources include the machine’s peripheral devices as well as features within the machine 
The resource allocation is a complex task which causes malfunctions in the system severe
of damage the deadlock 
So there are many techniques used to handle the competition among processes for resources 
Semaphore- Consider a time sharing operating system controlling the activities of a computer
with a single printer 
for the different programs requested for them 
Today we are going to discuss about the functions of operating system 
To control access to the printer by multiple processes at the same time operating system
must keep track of whether the printer has been located 
One approach is to use a flag, whose states are often referred to as set and clear 
A clear flag or value zero indicates that the printer is available and a set flag of
value one indicates that the printer is currently allocated but this simple flat system has
a problem 
The task of testing and possibly setting the flag may require several machine instructions 
It is therefore possible for a task to be interrupted after a clear flag has been detected
but before the flag has been set 
When this process is interrupted another process will get the time slides and it may also request
Operating systems are designed to provide uniform abstraction across multiple applications 
for the printer 
After sometime when the original process resumes, it will start from where it has stopped 
So it had read the value of flag which is zero and request for the printer and set the flag 
This process will be given access to the printer 
Now the situation is two processes are using the same printer which is of no use 
The solution to this is to insist that the task of testing and setting the flag be completed
without interruption 
One approaches to use the interrupt disable and interrupt enable instruction but this
is not optimal because it may block future interrupt 
A properly implemented flag called semaphore is used in software systems in much the same
As an interface – The architecture of most computers at the mission language level is
way as they are in railway system 
Corresponding to the section of track that can contain only one train at a time is the
critical section that can be executed by only one process at a time, that is mutual exclusion
to a critical region is obtained by using semaphores 
To enter the critical section process must find the semaphore clear and then set semaphore
before entering critical region, then upon exiting the process must clear the semaphore 
If the semaphore is found to be in its set state the process trying to enter the critical
region must wait until the semaphore has been clear 
Deadlock- Another problem that can arise during resource allocation is deadlock 
The condition in which two or more processors are blocked from progressing because each
primitive and difficult to program especially for input or output 
is waiting for a resource that is allocated to another but deadlock can occur only if
all four of the following conditions are satisfied 
Mutual exclusion- The resources are acquired and used in a mutually exclusive
manner  Hold and wait- Each process continues to hold resources already allocated to it while waiting
for other resources 
No preemption- Resources allocated to one process can be retrieved from it only by the
voluntary action of that process 
Circular wait- Deadlocked processes are involved in a circular chain 
The deadlock problem can be removed by attacking any one of these conditions 
The occurrence of deadlock is considered so remote that no effort is made avoid the problem
The program that hides the truth about the hardware from the programmer and presence
instead the approaches to detect it, then correct it by forcibly retrieving some of the
allocated resources 
In this module we have discussed about the various functions of operating system such
as interfacing and resource management 
The different functions such as memory management, device management, process management and
information management are discussed in detail 
The concept of process and various activities of processes are referred here 
The operating system plays an important role in handling the competition among different
processes and allocating various resources to processes 
This modulus ends with a reference to the various problems of inter-process communication 
a nice simple view of named files that can be read and written is the operating system 
Please try to answer the following questions 
List four activities of a typical operating system 
What information is contained in a process table within an operating system?
What is the difference between a process that is ready and a process that is waiting?
Identify the components of the state of a process?
What is meant by a semaphore?

Until then bye 
a simple file oriented interface and also conceals a lot of unpleasant things concerning
interrupts, timers, memory management and other low level features 
In each case the abstraction offered by the operating system is simpler and easier to
use than that offered by the underlying hardware 
Operating system is the most fundamental of all the system programs 
In this view the function of the operating system is to present the user with the equivalent
of an extended machine or virtual machine that is easier to program than the underlying hardware 
As a resource manager- An operating system is a set of programs that is used to manage
various resources and overall operations of a computer system 
Resource management includes sharing resources in two ways with time and space 
When a resource is time shared the different programs or users may use them in different turns 
For example, if there is only one CPU and multiple programs want to run them the operating
system first allocate the CPU to one program and after a certain period of time it will
allocate CPU to the next program and then to the next and then so on 
The other type of sharing is space sharing 
It is a layer of software on top of the hardware which constitutes the system and manages instructions
Instead of taking turns the customer gets parts of the resource 
For example, main memory is divided among several running programs so that each one
can be in the main memory at the same time 
Basic functionalities of an operating system- Operating System provides a number of services 
At the lowest level system calls allow a running program to make requests from the operating
system directly 
Since an operating system is large, modularity is important 
Process management- In deals with the assignment of processor to different task been performed
by the computer system 
The functions for process management are kept track of active process, the part of the program
to work with 
that is processed by the CPU by means of some data structure that depict the state of the system 
The operating system contains a scheduler that selects which process to running next
when running process is switched off, when allocating the CPU to a new process 
The kernel saves the state of the departing process and restores the state of the incoming
process which is known as conduct switch 
The operating system is responsible for the following activities in connection with process
management 
The creation and deletion of both user and system processes, the supervision and assumption
of processes, the provision of machanism for process synchronization, the provision of
mechanism for process communication, the provision of mechanisms for deadlock handling 
It also provides an easy to use interface to the users 
The program that keeps track of the processes and status of the process is called the traffic controller 
The process scheduler is the program that decides which process get the processor when
and how much 
Allocating the processor to a process by setting up necessary hardware registers if the job
of the dispatcher, so the system calls or services associated with these functions include
create a process, destroy a process, suspend a process, resume a process and change the
priority of a process, block a process, wake up a process and dispatch a process 
Memory management- Memory is a large array of words or bytes having a unique address 
The main purpose of a computer system is program execution 
These programs are in main memory during execution with the data they access 
The major function of an operating system is to hide the inner complexity of the hardware
Main memory is generally the only storage device that the CPU is able to address directly 
But main memory is too small to accommodate all the data and programs, so computer system
provides secondary storage to backup main memory 
The memory management functions include memory protection mechanism, member swapping mechanism
and virtual memory mechanism such as page fault handling and page replacement 
Hence the operating system performs the following activities for memory management keep track
of which parts of memory are currently being used and by whom, decide which process is
to be loaded into memory when memory space becomes available and how much, allocate and
reclaim memory space as needed 
For the secondary storage or disk management the operating system performs the following
and give the programmer a friendly and convenient set of instructions to work with 
functions, free space management, storage allocation, disk scheduling 
The operating system keeps a list of free memory before loading a program into memory
from disk, the required memory area is allocated to it and the operating system updates the
list of free memory 
Services of the operating system in this regards are allocate a chunk of memory to process,
free a chunk of memory from a process 
Device management- One of the roles of an operating system is to hide the complexity
of specific hardware devices from the user, only the device driver knows the features
of specific device to which it is assigned 
The different components for this are a buffer caching system, a general device driver interface,
The operating system provide the support for all other system programs such as compilers
drivers for specific hardware devices 
A program as it is running may need additional resources to proceed such as more memory,
tape drive, access to files, etcetera 
If the resources are available they can be branded and control can be returned to the
user program 
Most operating system treat all devices such as disk, tape, terminals and printers in the
same general manager with special management for the processor and memory 
Device management refers to the way these generic devices are handled 
So the task of operating system to accomplish device management is keep track of the IO
devices, channels and control link 
and editors and application programs like accounting software and games 
Welcome back 
In the text environment English like words are used and is similar to that of third-generation languages 
In a fourth generation language visual environment or the programmer uses a toolbar to drag and
drop various items like button, text boxes, labels, etcetera to create a visual definition
of an application like user interface or reports 
Most third generation languages and fourth generation languages allow the programmer
to work in an integrated development environment or IDE 
An IDE is a programming environment which presents aids for designing, coding, editing,
debugging and testing the program 
Fourth generation languages also include the ordering environments for creating multimedia
application, computer based training program, web pages, etcetera 
Large programs can contain thousands of individual files each for a specific purpose 
Fifth generation languages - The fifth generation languages are actually of a little bit confusing 
Some experts consider the more advanced ordering environment to be fifth generation languages,
while other do not 
On principal a fifth generation language would use Artificial Intelligence to create software
based on user's descriptions 
Programming Paradigms – The generation approach of classifying programming language is based
on a linear scale on which a language is positioned as determined by the degree to which the user
of the language is freed from the features of computer and allowed to think in terms
of associated with the problem 
The historical development of programming languages is represented in the following figure 
Some files contain instructions while some other contains data 
The figure shows four paths the presenting the functional, object-oriented, imperative
and declarative paradigms with different languages associated with each paradigm positioned in
a manner that indicates that development relative to other languages 
The imperative paradigm or the procedure paradigm represents the traditional approach to the
programming process 
The imperative paradigm defines the programming process to be the development of sequence
of commands that when followed manipulate data to produce the desired result 
Hence, the imperative paradigm gives the approach of programming process by finding an algorithm
to solve the problem and expressing that algorithm as a sequence of commands 
The decorative paradigm asks a programmer to describe the problem to be solved rather
Although a computer’s code must consist of zeros and ones, computer programmers use
than an algorithm to be followed 
That is a declarative programming system applies a pre-established general purpose problem
solving algorithm to solve problems presented to it 
The other programming paradigm is called the functional paradigm in which the program is
viewed as an entity that accepts input and produces the output 
By this paradigm a program is constructed by connecting smaller predefined program units
or predefined function so that the output from each unit can be felt as the input to
the next unit 
Another programming paradigm is the object oriented paradigm which is associated with
the programming process called object oriented programming or OOP 
programming languages instead of binary 
Here a software system is viewed as a collection of units called objects 
These objects are capable of performing the actions that are immediately related to itself
as well as requesting actions of other objects 
These objects would be associated with a collection of procedures call methods describing how
that object is to respond to the occurrence of various events 
The systems development life cycle for programming 
Programs are the fundamental units of information systems 
To create software products programmer follows a series of processes or lifecycle 
Phase one - Needs analysis 
After the problem is identified and understood the programmer checks the program designed
Programming languages helps the programmer to describe a program using a variation of
to see what the user needs the program to do 
Before beginning the design, the programmer has to determine the program starting and
stopping points 
Phase two - Program design 
In the design stage the programmer will figure out the logic for coding 
Many tools are used for designing such as IPO charts for structured programming, circles
and message pipes for object oriented programming and pseudo code, etcetera 
Phase three – Development 
Development or coding involves writing and testing the source code 
The programmer writes codes to implement the requirements of the user 
Basic English 
For the coding the programmer can use a text editor or a visual editor 
While coding there are chances for errors or bugs in the program 
The two main types of bugs are syntax errors and logic errors 
The syntax errors occurs when the rules of the programming languages are violated 
The compiler or interpreter will point out these errors and hence finding out this type
of errors is relatively easy 
Logic errors are the mistakes in algorithm are difficult to find out and may not even
noticed before implementation 
The process of identifying and eliminating this error is called debugging 
Phase four – Implementation 
This is called the source code 
Implementation involves installing software and allowing users to test it by using 
This step often consists of a lot of documentation both inside the code and in the form of manuals
for the users 
Before implementation all the misconception of the programmer about the codes are found
and fixed 
Phase five – Maintenance 
Maintenance starts as soon as the program is installed 
Work continues due to several reasons 
Some minor bugs may not have been fixed at the time of program released 
Sometimes there may be some minor addition or sometime major modifications in response
Evolution of programming languages – Programming is a way of creating a set of instructions
to the user request 
This is the longest phase of the program development life cycle with last for several years 
Traditional programming concepts - Here we are going to have a discussion on some of
the constant found in imperative and object oriented programming languages 
C is a third-generation imperative language, C plus plus is an object oriented language
which is an extension of C  Java and C Sharp are object oriented languages derived from
C plus plus 
Whatever may be the basic concepts followed in each language, the statements in the programming
languages tend to be fall into three categories declarative statements, imperative statements
and comments 
for the computer 
Declarative statements define customize terminology used in the program 
These are the names used to reference data items, imperative statements describe steps
in the underlying algorithm 
Comments are used to enhance the readability of a program 
It explains the features of program in a human understandable form 
Variables and data types - High level programming languages allow the main memory locations
to be a referenced by descriptive name rather than numbers 
Such a name is known as a variable which implies that the values taught at each location will
be changing as the program executes 
The programming languages require that these variables be identified through declarative
To develop these instructions programmers use the well-defined programming languages
In this module we are going to discuss about programming languages 
statement before being used in the program 
These declarative statements require the programmer to specify the type of data that will be stored
at the memory locations reference by variables 
Such a type is known as a data type and encompasses the manner in which the data item is encoded
and the operations that can be performed on that data 
The type integer refers to numeric data consisting of whole numbers which will be stored in two’s
complement form and the operations associated with integer data include arithmetic operations,
logical operations, etcetera 
An integer type variable to be used in a program should be declared toward the beginning of
the program as int limit, which means that limit is a variable which will be used later
to create source code, then convert the source code into object code for the computer 
in this program to refer to a memory area containing a value stored in two’s complement form 
The real type or float refers to the numeric data other than whole numbers 
These are stored in floating point notation and the operations associated with are similar
to those of integers 
Other common data types used are character and Boolean 
Character refers to the data consisting of symbols and stored in Ask key and Unicode 
The operations performed on this data include the comparison, concatenation, etcetera 
The statement char letter could be used in C, C plus plus, C Sharp and Java to declare
the variable letter to be of type char 
The type Boolean refers to data items that can take only true or false values 
Machine code consisting of zeros and ones is the only language understood by the computer 
The operation of Boolean includes enquiries as to whether the current value is true or false 
The type such as int, char, float, Boolean are called the primitive types 
The translator uses the knowledge from the declaration statements to translate it into
machine language and to signal the errors in operation 
Data Structure – The programs are often associated with certain data structure which
is the conceptual shape or arrangement of data 
For example, text is normally viewed as a long string of characters 
Student records may be viewed as a rectangular table where each row represents the associated
information about a particular student 
One common data structure used in programming languages is the homogeneous array
But programming using ones and zeros is difficult and error-prone and hence researchers develop
which is a collection of values of the same type 
The arrays can be one dimensional as a list, two dimensional as a table or with tables
of higher dimension 
To establish such an array, most of the programming languages require the declaration statement
to specify the name of the array along with the length of each dimension of the array 
In mask five, ten, means that the variable mask will be used in the program to refer
to a two dimensional array of integers having five rows and ten columns 
Once a homogeneous array has been declared it can be referenced in the program by its
name and the individual components or items can be referenced by specifying the indices
that specify the row and column 
more sophisticated programming languages 
For example, the statement mask two four refers to the individual component stored in mask
in the fourth column of the second row 
There is also a heterogeneous array which represents a block of data in which different
elements can have different types 
These are referred to as structure and declared as struct, open brace, char name of twenty,
int age, float gradepoint, then close brace, student, which says that variable student
is referred to a structure consisting of three members call name, age, and gradepoint 
Constants and literals – Sometimes a fixed predetermined value is used in the program 
For example, the program for controlling the air traffic in a particular airport contains
numerous references to that airports altitude above the sea level, while writing a program
The programming tools are developed to make programming more easily and are used to convert
one can include this value, say seven six five feet literally each time it is required 
Such an explicit appearance of a value is called a literal 
The use of literals leads to program statements such as effective alt equal to alt plus seven
six five, where effective alt and alt are assumed to be variable and seven six five
is a literal 
In most programming languages literals are delineated with quotation marks to distinguish
them from other program components 
Often the use of literals mask the meaning of the statements in which they appear 
Moreover, literals complicate the task of modifying the program 
To solve this problems programming languages allow descriptive names to be assigned to
the human like instruction into strings of ones and zeros 
specific non-changeable values 
Such a name is called constant 
For example, const int altitude equal to seven six five associates the identifier altitude
with the fixed value seven six five 
With this, the above statement can be rewritten as effective alt equal to alt plus altitude 
While modifying the program it needs only a single change to the declaration statement
of the constant 
Assignments statements – Once the terminologies to be used in the program have been declared
a programmer can start describing the algorithm involved 
This is done by means of imperative statements 
To use any of the programming languages the programmer has to follow some rules like providing
The most basic imperative statement is the assignment statement which requests that a
value be assigned to a variable 
The statement sum equal to num one plus num two in C, C plus plus, C Sharp and Java requests
that the sum of num one and num two be assigned to the variable sum 
The power of assignment statements comes from the scope of expressions that can appear on
the right side of the statement 
Many programming languages allow the use of one symbol to represent more than one operation 
In these cases the meaning of the symbol is determined by the data type of the operands 
For example, the symbol plus represents addition when used with numeric and the same symbol
when used with a character strings results in
information in certain order and structure using special symbols, using punctuations,
concatenation  Such multiple use of an operation symbol is called overloading 
Control statements – A control statement is an imperative statement that alters the
execution sequence of the program 
Modern languages are designed with control statements that allow an entire branching
structure to be expressed within a
Single statement  The commonly used control structures in high level programming languages are if then else,
while, case and for 
The if-then-else allows a choice between two options and while repeats the statements if
the specified condition is true 
Case is a multi-way selection statement in which the selection is based on the same expression
etcetera 
or variable 
The for is a loop structure similar to while, but the difference is that the initialization,
modification and the termination of law is incorporated in a parenthetical structure
within the single statement 
Comments – Though the programming language is well designed, additional information is
helpful when a human tries to read and understand a well featured program 
For this the programming languages provide ways of inserting explanatory statements called
comments within the program 
These statements are ignored by the translator 
Without such documentation large complex programs are difficult for a programmer other than
These rules are called the syntax of the programming language 
Software provides the instructions that run the hardware in a computer 
its developer to understand and modify if necessary 
There are two common ways of inserting comments in a program, one is to surround the entire
comment by special markers and the other at the beginning of the comments at one end 
The single line comments are marked as to begin with double slashes, while the other
this is a comment, start slash are valid comments 
A good approach to put comments is by collecting the comments that relate to a single program
and put it at the beginning of the unit 
This will increase the readability of the program 
Let us summarize the module 
The syntax of one language is different from the other 
In this module we have discussed the basic features of a programming language 
We covered the topics such as the history and evolution of programming languages, the
fundamental building blocks of the programming language such as variables, data types, data
structures, constants, literals and the control constructs 
We concluded by referring to the statements such as assignment and comments 
Please try to answer the following questions 
Explain the evolution of the programming language?
What are the different programming paradigms?
Differentiate between machine level language and high level language?
Write a note on machine language?
The programming languages can be grouped in different ways 
What is meant by assembly language?
Explain the system development life cycle for programming 
What is meant by a data structure?
What is the role of comments in programming?
Hope you enjoyed this session 
See you next time, until then bye 
Based on history programming languages are divided into three categories such as machine
level, assembly level, and higher level 
Machine and assembly languages – The fundamental of all languages is the machine language 
The machine code consisting of ones and zeros is created using machine language 
Each computer program written in other computer languages is translated to machine language
before running that program 
Each type of computer has its own mission language 
As mission language is the language of the CPU, programs written in this language are
Software tells the computer what to do 
executed very fast 
But writing programs in machine language is very time consuming and error-prone 
Programs written in machine language are not portable and the programmer need to know how
each instruction affects the memory and register in the CPU 
Because of these limitations programs are rarely written in machine language nowadays 
Assembly language is one level above the machine language 
It uses certain predefine symbolic codes called mnemonics instead of binary codes 
Remembering mnemonics is easier than remembering binary codes 
So, writing programs in assembly language is easier and less time consuming compared to
writing programs in machine language 
This software refers to a set of programs that gives the direction to the computer of
Assembly language closely resembles machine language and both are considered low level languages 
Since, a computer cannot understand assembly  language program written in assembly language
must be translated into an equivalent machine language program before it can be run 
The translation of an assembly language program into machine language program is done by a program called
assembler 
It also assembles the mission codes in the primary memory of the computer and makes it
ready for execution 
A symbolic program written by a programmer in assembly language is called source program 
After the source program has been converted into machine language by an assembler it is
referred to as an object program 
doing the work assigned to it 
Limitations of machine language and assembly languages – Writing programs is difficult
and time consuming, CPU specific, not portable, programmer need to know the inner details
of the system 
Higher level languages - High level languages overcome these limitations to a large extent 
Higher level programming languages used familiar words rather than the details strings of digits
that make up machine instruction 
For representing computer operations these languages use operator such as plus minus
signs etcetera, by this people can read, write and understand computer programs easily 
Some of the common high level languages are FORTRAN, COBOL, C, C plus plus, Java, etcetera 
But the programs written in high level languages must be translated into equivalent machine
A computer program on the other hand is a set of instructions or statements or code
language program 
This is done using translation programs like compilers and interpreters 
The interpreter translates the program written in a high level language into machine language
at the time of executing that program instruction by instruction 
Therefore, no object code is saved for future use 
While using an interpreter the translation and execution process alternate 
The compiler translates the entire high level language program into equivalent machine language
program called a object program before executing it 
These subject codes will be saved permanently, hence the program can be executed without
compiling in the future 
executed by the computer CPU 
Programming languages are sometimes referred in terms of generation 
Machine languages are called first generation languages and assembly languages are called
second generation languages 
Third generation languages – The third generation languages helped to write structured program easier 
These languages used English like phrasing and allowed the sharing of programs even though
each of the third generation languages has its own syntax their English like and easy
to understand 
Another important advantage of third generation languages is portability 
In order to port the code from one system to another the only condition is that the
new system should have a compiler or interpreter to create an executable from the source code 
A program is typically composed of a main module and sub-module 
Since the statements in a third generation language could theoretically be created on
any machine simply by applying the appropriate compiler, but in reality it is not that much simple 
When a compiler is designed particular characteristics of the underlying machine are reflected as
conditions on the language being translated 
This problem of portability is mainly due to the lack of standards 
To aid in this regard The American National Standards Institute and The International
Organization for Standardization have adopted and published standards for many of the popular languages 
Fourth generation languages - Fourth generation languages are easier to use than the third
generation languages 
These languages use either the text environment or a visual environment 
These models are stored as a collection of files 
﻿Welcome back  In this module we are going  to discuss about software engineering   
mainly categorized as high level or conceptual  design and detailed design  The conceptual design  
provides only a conception or logical view of the  overall system  The details are not specified    
During the detailed design process the inner  details of how the system can be implemented will  
be specified  The design of the software includes  the design of user interfaces such as input  
and output  The other major considerations are  database, procedure, control, and documentation   
Implementation - Implementation involves the  actual coding of programs, creation of data files,  
and development of data bases  Implementation  is considered to be a bottom-up process in which  
individual modules are program and then  combined to form larger components    
Commonly used approach is to construct the partial  modules and used in larger components and then  
expand to complete fully functional components   Another structural way to implement the software  
development period, hence the software engineering  should include the personnel management  
is a top down approach in which a skeletal  version of the entire system is implemented  
first and then later provides a complete system   A programmer rather than a software analyst  
contributes to the implementation process  A  programmer is assigned with writing programs  
to implement the design produced at the earliest  stage  Even though we made a distinction between  
the analyst and a programmer, today the steps in  software development process are in the mixed    
Testing – Testing is of two types  One  is validation testing to confirm that the  
software system implemented is according to the  requirements and specifications identified during  
analysis phase  The other is defect testing  to identify and correct errors in the program   
But even after the satisfactory completion of the  testing phase, it is not possible to assure that a  
program is error-free  Since the input data domain  of most of the programs is very large, it is not  
and project management apart from computer  science, but in this module topics related  
possible to test the program for each value in the  input domain  Thus, testing involves a set of test  
inputs or test cases and observe the behavior  of the program whether it is as expected    
The commonly used terms associated with  testing are error  It’s a mistake committed  
during the development phase  The error  is also termed as fault, bug or defect   
of the system and expected output of the system   Test suite – It is a set of all test cases with  
which a software product is tested  The testing  process is depicted in the following figure   
There are two main approaches to systematic  design of test cases  They are black box testing  
and white box testing  In the black box  testing approach the test cases are designed  
using the functional specifications of the  software without any knowledge about the internal  
to computer science are discussed  The software  engineering discipline - The problems involved  
structure of the software  So the black box  testing is also known as functional testing    
The white box test cases require a deep knowledge  about the internal structure of the program and  
are also called structural testing  Both  validation testing and defect testing are  
closely associated with implementation  Each  module in a well-designed system can be tested  
independently of the others by using simplified  version of the other modules to simulate the  
interactions between the testing module and other  parts of the system  As the individual modules  
are completed these are combined to the larger  system and leads to overall system testing    
Experience has shown that even after significance  testing the large software systems contains  
numerous errors, some of these may not be  detected during the lifetime of the system   
But, some others may cause severe damages  The  software engineering is to eliminate these errors  
in software engineering are estimating the cost  in time, money and other resources to complete  
and hence need lots of research  Now, let us  summaries what we have discussed in this module   
This module provides an introduction to the broad  field of software engineering  This module starts  
with a comparison of software engineering with  traditional engineering discipline and our view  
of the software engineering tools and various  phases of software engineering are given here    
Since, the development phase  is of major consideration,  
the development life cycle of a software  product is discussed in some detail  This  
module concludes by pointing to the importance  of research in the software engineering field   
Before we attend the next unit please  try to answer the following questions   
What are the major distinction between software  engineering and other engineering discipline?   
Suggest any good metric for measuring  the complexity of a program? What are the  
the project, dividing the project into manageable  modules, ensuring the compatibility of modules,  
different phases of a software development  life cycle? What are the different types  
of testing associated with a software system  implementation? What is meant by case tools?  
Compare between procedure and function  Write  a note on software requirement specification

communication among various parts of the  systems, measuring the progress, etcetera    
Since engineering is a well-established field,  there are some previously developed techniques  
to face with some of the above mentioned problems,  but there may be fundamental differences between  
the properties of software and those of  other fields of engineering  These may lead  
to cost overrun, late delivery of products, and  dissatisfaction of customers  Such distinction  
The objectives of this module are to understand  the importance of software engineering,  
deals with constructing systems from prefabricated  generic components  In the traditional engineering  
discipline the off-the-shelf components can be  used to construct a more complex device    
But in software engineering previously designed  components may be domain specific and internal  
design is based on specific application   Hence the use of generic components  
is limited  So the complex software  systems should be started from scratch   
Another difference between the software  engineering and other engineering disciplines is  
the lack of matrix or quantitative techniques for  measuring the properties of the software  There  
are some methods of measuring the complexity and  quality of a product in traditional engineering  
discipline, but in the case of software  products these methods cannot be applicable    
Thus, research in software engineering is  currently progressing on two dimensions   
to get an idea about the issues related to  the development of a software, to study about  
Some researchers called practitioners work  towards developing techniques for immediate  
application  The other type of researchers  called theoreticians search for principles  
and theories on which most stable techniques  can be constructed  In the present scenario  
we are mostly dependent upon large software  systems  Every field of life like economy, health,  
government, transportation, defense, etcetera is  using software systems for their processing    
This implies that software errors can cause  disasters and the progress of practitioners  
and theoreticians is enormous  The  application of computer technology  
to the software development process results in  computer aided software engineering or CASE   
CASE tools include project planning systems,  project management systems, documentation tools,  
prototyping and simulation systems, interface  design systems and programming systems    
the significance of software engineering apart  from traditional engineering, to understand  
Once a project is found to be feasible, project  planning is to be done by the project managers   
This planning is to be completed before the  beginning of any development activity  The  
project planning system support the major  activities of project planning such as  
cost estimation, project  scheduling and personal allocation   
The goal of software project management is  to enable a group of software developers  
to work efficiently towards successful completion  of the project  Project management systems assist  
in monitoring the progress of the development  project and documentation tools assist in  
writing and organizing documentation   A prototype is a rough implementation of the  
system  These are built using shortcuts and a very  crude version of the actual systems  The prototype  
is used to illustrate the input data formats,  reports, messages and interactive dialogues  
the different phases of software development   to learn the software life cycle   
to gain the understanding of user needs   These prototypes can be developed using the  
prototyping and simulation systems  The interface  design systems assist in the GUI development   
Writing and debugging programs are  supported by programming systems    
Some more sophisticated case tools include code  generators that produce high level language  
programs if the specification for a part of the  system are given  Besides the research for methods  
of developing better quality software systems,  professional organizations have contributed  
their efforts by setting standards of ethics  and professional conduct among their membership   
The association of computing machinery or ACM  and the institute of electrical and electronics  
engineering or IEEE are at the front to adopt  codes of professional conduct and ethics    
The software lifecycle - The software life  cycle has a well-defined iterative process   
Software engineering is the branch of computer  science that deals with the principles to guide  
The process theoretically never ends as the  cycle gets repeated  The software life cycle  
is the most fundamental concept in software  engineering  The following figure presents  
a view of the software life cycle  Once the  software is developed, it enters a cycle of  
being used and modified which continues for  the lifetime of the software  This is true  
for any of the manufacturing product, but in  other disciplines a modification is better known  
as a repair because they pass deteriorate   Software does not deteriorate but there may be  
some errors found or there may be some changes  in the application where the software is used   
Whatever may be the reason for modification,  the program and its documentation should be  
well-understood by the person otherwise  modification may introduce more problems  
than it solves  So generally the software  part which needs modification as discarded  
the software development process which leads  to efficient, reliable software products   
and develops a new system instead of  modifying the existing package    
But from experiences it is clear that some effort  during the development makes the modifications  
easier when required  Therefore, most of  the research in software engineering focuses  
on the development stage of the software  lifecycle  The various phases of  
software development are analysis, design,  implementation and testing as shown below   
Analysis - The development phase begins with  analysis  It is the specification of the services  
expected from the proposed system  The  conditions such as time constraints, security,  
etcetera should also be identified   Analysis phase needs the input from the  
future user of the proposed system  In a  traditional software development context  
where the user is an entity, the analysis starts  with a feasibility study conducted by the user   
The problems faced in developing software systems  are similar to writing smaller programs but will  
If the software is produced for the mass market  to be sold or downloaded through the internet, the  
user is less precisely defined entity and analysis  begin with a market study  As the needs of the  
users are identified they have to specify a set of  requirements that the new system must satisfy    
These requirements as stated in terms of the  application, for example, there they must  
be restricted to authorize the users  After  the system requirements are identified they  
are converted into more technical specifications   Hence the above requirements may be stated as the  
system will not respond until an approved eight  digit password has been type at the keyboard   
The analysis phase of the software  development concludes with a document  
called software requirement specification  or SRS that identifies the requirements  
and specifications of the proposed system   The professional organization such as IEEE  
vary in size and quantity  The development  of large systems often requires efforts  
and large software clients have adopted  standards for its composition that is  
the software requirement specification is a  written agreement between the parties concerned  
and is a method of solving the disputes that  might arise later in the development process   
The software requirement specification should  define a firm objective  It is assumed that your  
communication and changing requirements are the  major causes of cost overruns and late delivery   
This can be resolved if the requirements are  specified and both the parties agreed upon it    
Design - The analysis concentrated on what the  proposed system should do whereas the design  
concentrates on how the system will fulfill  the requirements  At this phase detailed plans  
according to the requirement specifications  are developed  The result will be diagrams  
and models of the proposed system with different  levels of details  The design process can be  
of more than one person over some period   The personnel assign may change during the  
﻿Welcome to the session on system  tools and utility programs   
new hardware and software support   Firmware will make it possible  
for devices to work better with the old  and new operating systems and applications   
Almost all devices and peripherals are embedded  with firmware  Network card, TV tuner, router,  
scanner or monitor an examples of devices  which have firmware installed on them    
Programming language translators - These are  intermediate programs relied on by software  
programmers to translate high level language  source code to machine language code  The former  
is a collection of programming languages that are  easy for humans to comprehend and code that is  
Java, C plus plus, Python, PHP, BASIC, etcetera   The letter is a complex code only understood by  
the processor  Popular language translators are  compilers, interpreters, assemblers, linkers,  
loaders, and macros  They are usually designed by  computer manufacturers  Translator programs may  
System software also includes utility software   
perform a complete translation of program codes or  translate every other instruction at a time    
Machine code is written in a number system  of base two written out in zeros or ones   
This is the lowest level language possible  While  seemingly meaningless to humans the zeros and ones  
are actually sequenced intelligently by the  processor to refer to every conceivable human  
code and word  Besides simplifying the work  of software developers, translators help in  
various design task  They identify syntax errors  during translation, thus allowing changes to be  
made to the code  Provide diagnostic reports  whenever the code rules are not followed   
Allocate data storage for the program  List  both source code and program details    
A brief description of the compilers,  interpreters, assemblers, linkers,  
loaders and macros are given below  Compiler – A  compiler is a software that translates the code  
Utility software helps to manage,  maintain and control computer resources   
written in one language to some other language  without changing the meaning of the program   
The compiler is also said to make the target  code efficient and optimized in terms of time  
and space  The compiler performs almost all of  the following operations during compilation,  
pre-processing, lexical analysis,  passing, semantic analysis,  
that is syntax detected translation, conversion of  input programs to an intermediate representation,  
code optimization and code generation   Examples of compiler may include GCC  
that is a C compiler, G plus plus for C plus plus  compiler, Java C for Java compiler, etcetera   
Interpreter – An interpreter is a computer  program that directly executes that is it performs  
instructions written in a programming  of scripting language  Interpreter does  
not require the program to be previously  combined into a mission language program   
Operating systems typically contain the necessary  tools for this, but separate utility programs  
An interpreter translates high-level instructions  into an intermediate form which is then executed  
immediately  Interpreters are fast as it does not  need to go through the compilation stage during  
which machine instructions are generated   Interpreter continuously translates the  
program until the first error is met   If an error comes it stops executing,  
hence debugging is easy  Examples may include  Ruby, Python, PHP, etcetera  Assembler – An  
assembler is a program that converts assembly  language into machine code  It takes the basic  
commands and operations and converts them into  binary code specific to a type of processor   
Assemblers produce executable code that similar to  compilers  However, assemblers are more simplistic  
since they only convert low level code that  is assembly language to machine code    
Since each assembly language is designed for  a specific processor, assembling a program is  
can provide improved functionality   Utility software is often somewhat technical  
performed using a simple one to one mapping from  assembly code to machine code  On the other hand  
compilers must convert generic high-level source  code into machine code for a specific processor   
Linker – Linker is a program in a system  which helps to link an object module of  
program into single object file  It performs  the process of linking  Linkers are also called  
link editors  Linking is the process of  collecting and maintaining pieces of code  
and data into a single file  Linker also links  a particular module into system library    
It takes object modules from assembler as input  and form executable file as output for loader   
Linking is performed at both compile time when  the source code is translated into machine code  
and load time when the program is loaded into  memory by the loader  Linking is performed at  
the last step in compiling a program  Linking is  of two types, static linking and dynamic linking   
and targeted and uses with a solid knowledge  of computers  System software - System  
Static linking - It is performed during  the compilation of source program   
Linking is performed before execution in static  linking  It takes collection of relocatable object  
files and command line argument and generate fully  lined object files that can be loaded and run    
Static linker perform two major tasks  Symbol  resolution – It associates each symbol reference  
with exactly one symbol definition  Every  symbol have predefined task  Relocation - It  
relocate code and data section and modify symbol  references to the relocated memory location   
The linker copies or library routines used in  the program into executable images  As a result  
it requires more memory space, hence it does not  require the presence of library on the system  
when it is run  So it is faster and more portable   No failure chances and less error chance    
Dynamic linking - Dynamic linking  is performed during the runtime   
software refers to the files and programs  that make up computer's operating system   
This linking is accomplished by placing the name  of a sharable library in the executable image   
There are more chances of errors and failure  chances  It requires less memory space as multiple  
programs can share a single copy of the library   Loader - As the program that has to be executed  
currently must reside in the main memory of the  computer  It is the responsibility of the loader  
a program in an operating system to load the  executable file or module of a program generated  
by the linker to main memory for execution   It allocates memory space to the executable  
module in main memory  There are  three kinds of loading approaches  
absolute loading, relocatable loading and dynamic  runtime loading  Absolute loading - This approach  
loads the executable file of a program into  the same main memory location each time,  
but it has some disadvantages like a programmer  must be aware of the assignment strategies  
System files include libraries of functions,  system services, drivers for printers and  
for loading the modulus to the main memory  In  case a program is to be modified involving some  
insertion and deletion in the program then all the  addresses of the program have to be altered     
Relocatable loading - In this approach  the compiler or assembler does not produce  
actual main memory address  It  produces the relative addresses   
Dynamic runtime loading - In this approach the  absolute address for a program is generated  
when an instruction of an executable module  is actually executed  It is very flexible   
The loadable module or executable module can  be loaded into any region of main memory   
The executing program can be interrupted  in between and can be swapped out to the  
disk and back to main memory, this time  at a different main memory address    
Macros – A macro is an extension to the basic  assembler language  They provide a means for  
other hardware system, preferences and other  configuration files  Since system software  
generating a commonly used sequence of  assembler instructions or statements   
The sequence of instructions or statements will  be coded one time within the macro definition   
Whenever the sequence is needed within a  program the macro will be called  Macros  
allow a programmer to define pseudo operations,  typically operations that are generally desirable,  
are not implemented as a part  of the processor instruction,  
and can be implemented as a sequence of  instructions  Each use of a macro generates  
new program instructions  The macro has the  effect of automating writing the program   
Macros can be defined used in many programming  languages like C, C plus plus, etcetera    
Example macro in C programming – Macros are  commonly used in C to define small snippets  
of code  If the Macro has parameters, they are  substituted into the macro body during expansion,  
runs at the most basic level of computer it  is called low level software  It generates  
thus a C macro can mimic a C function  The  usual reason for doing this is to avoid  
the overhead of a function call in simple  cases where the code is lightweight enough that  
the function call overhead has a significant  impact on performance  Utility programs – A  
utility or software utility is computer system  software intended to analyze, configure,  
monitor or help maintain a computer   Typically a utility is smaller than a standard  
program in size and may be included with an  operating system or installed separately   
Utility software should be contrasted with  application software, which allows users to  
do things like creating text documents, playing  games, listening to music or surfing the web   
Rather than providing these kinds of user  oriented or output oriented functionality,  
utilities software usually focuses on how the  computer infrastructure including the computer  
the user interface and allows the operating  system to interact with the hardware    
Software is a generic term for an organized  collection of computer data and instructions   
hardware, operating system, application  software, and data storage operates     
Due to this focus some utilities are rather  technical and targeted at people with an advanced  
level of computer knowledge  Others are commonly  used by all the users  Most utilities are highly  
specialized and designed to perform only a single  task or a small range of task  However there are  
also some utilities suites that combines  several features in one piece of software   
Most major operating systems come with several  pre-installed utilities  Some of the most popular  
utility software are given here, antivirus,  file management tools, compression tools,  
disk cleanup, disk defragmenter, backup,  registry cleaners, and file splitters   
Antivirus – A virus can be defined as a malicious  program that attaches itself to a horse program  
and makes multiple copies of itself, slowing down,  corrupting or destroying the system  A software  
Some system software is used directly by users  and other system software works in the background   
that assist the operating system in providing  virus-free environment to the user is called  
antivirus  An antivirus catch the system for any  virus and is defected, gets rid of it by deleting  
or isolating it  It can detect many types of virus  like Boot virus, Trojan, worms, spyware, etcetera   
When any external storage devices like  USB drive is attached to the system,  
antivirus software can set and gives  an alert if a virus is detected    
We can set up our systems for periodic  scans or scan whenever you feel the need   
A combination of both the techniques is  advisable to keep your system virus free   
File management tools – As we know file management  is an important function of operating systems  
as all data and instructions are stored in  the computer in the form of files  Utility  
software providing regular file management tasks  like browse, search, update, preview, etcetera  
System software can allow users to interact  directly with the hardware functionality  
are called the file management tools   Windows Explorer in Windows operating system,  
Google desktop, directory Opus, Double Commander  etcetera are examples of such tools    
Compression tools - Storage space is always at a  premium in computer systems  So operating systems  
are always looking at ways to minimize the amount  of storage space taken by files  Compression tools  
are utilities that assist operating systems in  shortening files so that they take less space   
After compression files are stored in a different  format and cannot be read or edited directly   
It needs to be an compressed before  it can be assessed for further use   
Some of the popular compression tools are  WinRAR, PeaZip and Unarchiver, etcetera   
Disk cleanup - Disk cleanup tools assist  users in freeing up disk space  The software  
scans hard disk to find files  that are no longer used and free  
like the device manager and many of the  utilities found in the control panel   
subspace by deleting them  Disk defragmenter –  Disk defragmenter is a disk management utility  
that increases file access speeds by rearranging  fragmented fires on continuous location    
Large files a broken down into fragments and maybe  stored in noncontiguous locations if conditionals  
ones are not available  When such files are  accessed by the user, access speed is slow  
due to fragmentation  Disk defragmenter utility  scans the hard disk and tries to assemble file  
fragments so that they may be stored in contiguous  locations  Backup - Backup utility enables  
backing up of files, folders, databases, or  complete disk  Backups are taken so that data  
may be restored in case of data loss  Backup is  a service provided by all operating systems    
In standalone systems backup may be taken in the  same or different drive  In case of networked  
systems backup may be done on backup servers   Registry cleaners - Registry cleaners are programs  
The most important feature of the system  software include closeness to the system,  
that allow for us to scan our computer for any  errors in the registry which is a collection of  
the code computer files that are essential to  perform and functionality and repairs them if  
needed  Registry cleaners are widely available  on the Internet and give a significant upper  
hand when cleaning up the mess, that a virus  or the other malware has left on our computer   
Likewise, some otherwise safe computers can cause  errors in the registry without intending to    
Registry files can also be corrupted if the  user unknowingly deletes or modifies a file  
in the registry  This usually occurs when an  inexperienced user tries to fix their computer  
and inevitably causes more damage than before   File splitters – File splitters are programs that  
allow to break a file into smaller pieces in  order to store or send files  File splitters  
often come in handy because many online storage  services including email attachments limit us to  
fast speed, difficult to manipulate, written in  low level language, difficult to design, etcetera   
specific file size that can be transferred at one  time even though files often exceed these limits   
File splitters allow to break the file into  two or more pieces, send them simultaneously  
and then brings* them back together when  we are ready to use the file again    
A good file splitter is files splits  It allows to  break a file if any size into multiple pieces and  
then rejoins the files together just as easily   Software is essential for a computer to work   
The computer is a machine that was only  according to the given instruction or software   
This can be divided into two such as system  software, that support the basic functionalities  
of a computer system and application software  that is used to interact with the system for  
specific applications  Utility software is  system software designed to help to analyze,  
configure, optimize or maintain a computer   It is used to support the computer infrastructure  
System software can be categorized under the  following  Operating system- Harnesses the  
in contrast to application software, which is  aim at directly performing task that benefit  
ordinary users  Hence we have  discussed language translators,  
linkers, loaders and other important system  utilities such as antivirus, debuggers, etcetera   
Hope you enjoyed this session  See you  next time, until then bye 
communication between hardware, system  programs and other applications    
Device driver- Enables device communication with  operating system and other programs  Firmware-  
Enables device control and identification   Translator- Translates high level language  
to low-level machine codes  Utility- Ensures  optimum functionality of devices and applications   
As we have seen earlier there are two  types of software, application software  
Operating system - We have already seen the basic  functionalities of an operating system  How well  
we’ll have a quick look on the important concepts  regarding it  The operating system is a type of  
system software kernel that sits between computer  hardware and end-user  It is installed first on  
a computer to allow devices and applications  to be identified and therefore functional    
System software is the first layer of software  to be loaded into memory every time a computer  
is powered up  Suppose a user wants to write  and print a report to an attached printer,  
a word processing application is  required to accomplish this task   
Data input is done using a keyboard or other  input devices and then displayed on the monitor   
The prepared data is then sent to the  printer  In order for the word processor,  
keyboard and printer to accomplish this task  they must work with the operating system  
and system software  Application software  helps users to solve a particular problem  
which controls input and output functions,  memory management, and print the spooling    
Today the user interacts with the operating system  through the graphical user interface or GUI on a  
monitor or touch screen interface  The desktop in  modern operating systems is a graphical workspace  
which contains menus, icons and apps that  are manipulated by the user through a mouse  
driven cursor or the touch of a finger   The Disk Operating System or DOS was a popular  
interface used in nineteen eighties  Types of  operating system - Real time operating system-  
It is installed in special purpose embedded  systems like robots cast and modems    
Single user and single task operating system-  These are installed on single user devices like  
phones  Single user and multitask operating  system- They are installed on contemporary  
personal computers  Multi-user operating system-  It is installed in network environments  
or carry out a specific task  A word processor  is an example of application software 
where many users have to share resources  Server  operating systems are examples of multi-user  
operating systems  Network operating systems-  It is used to share resources such as files,  
printers, etcetera, in a network setup   Internet web operating system- It is designed  
to run on the browser that is online  Mobile  operating system- It is designed to run on  
mobile phones, tablets and other mobile  devices  Functions of operating systems-  
They provide the interface between the  user and hardware through GUI  Manages  
and allocate memory space for applications   Processes the management of applications,  
input output devices and instructions  Configures  and manages internal and peripheral devices    
Manages single or multi-user storage  in local and network computers   
Security management of files and applications   Detects, installs, and troubleshoots devices   
System software coordinates the activities and  functions of hardware and software and its  
Monitors system performance through  Task Manager and other tools   
Produce error messages and  troubleshooting options   
Implement interface for network communication   Manages printers in single or multi-user systems   
Internal on network file management  Examples  of operating system - Popular operating systems  
for computers are Windows Ten,  Mac OS X, Linux, etcetera    
Popular network server operating systems are  Ubuntu server, Windows server, Red Hat Enterprise   
Popular internet of web operating systems  are Chrome OS, Club Linux, Remix OS   
Popular mobile operating systems are iPhone  OS, Android OS, Windows Phone OS, etcetera   
Device drivers – Driver software is a type of  system software which brings computer devices  
and peripherals to life  Drivers make  it possible for all connected components  
control the operations of computer hardware   A computer's operating system is an example of  
and external add-ons perform their intended task  and as directed by the operating system    
Without drivers the operating system would  not assign any duties  Examples of devices which  
require drivers are mouse, keyboard, sound  card, display card, network card, printer,  
etcetera  Usually the operating system ships with  drivers for most devices already in the market   
By default input devices such as mouse and  keyboard will have their drivers installed   
They may never require third party installations   If a device is newer than the operating system  
the user may have to download drivers from  manufacturer websites or alternative sources    
Firmware – Firmware is the operational software  embedded within a flash ROM or EPROM memory  
chips for the OS to identify it  It directly  manages and controls all activities of any  
single hardware  Traditionally firmware used to  mean fixed software as denoted by the word firm   
system software  Operating systems control the  computer hardware and act as an interface for  
It was installed or nonvolatile chips  and could be upgraded only by swapping  
them with new pre-programmed chips   This was done to differentiate them  
from high level software which could be updated  without having the swap components  Today  
firmware is stored in flash chips which can be  upgraded without swapping semiconductor chips    
BIOS and UEFI - The most important firmware in  computers today is installed by the manufacturer  
on the motherboard and can be accessed through the  old BIOS Basic Input Output System or the new UEFI  
Unified Extended Firmware Interface Platforms  It  is the configuration interface which loads first  
when the computer is powered up and is going  through post that is power on self-test   
The motherboard firmware starts by waking up  all the hardware and ensures that components  
like the processor, memory, and disk drivers are  operational  If all the crucial components are  
the users  The functions of operating system  such as process management, memory management,  
fine it will run the bootloader which  will load the operating system    
If the Random Access Memory is faulty, the BIOS  will not allow the computer to boot up  The user  
can change the BIOS and UEFI settings by pressing  special keys a function key, delete, or the escape  
key at boot up to load the configuration page   The user can configure security, boot order,  
time and other options in the page that pops up   Though they work differently firmware compliments  
drivers in a few ways  Both give identity  to hardware devices with the letter making,  
the operating system see the device  The major  difference between the two is that firmware will  
always reside within the device while drivers  will install within the operating system    
Firmware upgrades come from the device  manufacturer not the operating system  
manufacturer  They are necessary if the  user wants computer hardware to receive  
device management and information management,  etcetera, were discussed in the previous session   
Welcome back 
They are efficient and economical to use for applications in which activity ratio is high 
Disadvantages of sequential files- they are inefficient and uneconomical to use for applications
in which activity ratio is low 
There use is limited to batch processing environment because of the need to accumulate transactions
in batches 
This is to keep the activity ratio high 
Sequential processing requires extra hour head off sorting the file before using them
for processing that is both transaction and master files must be stored in some sequence
before processing 
Sequential processing often leads to data redundancy problem because the same data may
even today 
be stored in several files sequenced on different keys 
Indexed files- sequential files are used for storing data that will be processed in the
order in which the entries are stored 
This method is inefficient when the records in the file are to be accessed in an unpredictable
order 
To identify the location of the required logical record quickly, index is used 
Such a file system is called indexed file 
The index for a file contains a list of keys stored in the file along with the entries
indicating the location of the record containing each key 
Hence, to find a particular record first identify the index and then retrieve the block of information
Data storage, data processing deals with operations on data, these operations are defined on different
stored at the location associated with that key 
A files index is normally stored as a separate file on the same secondary storage device
as the indexed file 
The index is transferred to the main memory before file processing begins, to easily access
the records in the file whenever necessary 
The principle of indexed files is similar to that of the index used in a book or hospital
entry that is the display board at the entrance of the large multi storied building containing
names and room numbers of the <?>occupance</?> is an index that helps to locate a person’s
room within the building or if we want to read about a particular topic in some books 
First we will find out that topic in the index of the book to get the page number rather
levels which lead to the data storage hierarchy of data processing 
than searching for the topic from page one and check all the pages until we find the
topic 
After getting the page number we will directly turn to that page and start reading 
In the indexed file organization there are two files such as data file and index file 
The data file contains the records stored in the file and index file contains the index
key and disk address of each record stored in the data file 
Records in the data files can be stored in random sequence 
But index keys in the index file are stored as a sorted sequence of index key values 
Different variations of the basic index concepts are used in the file system 
One of these is to construct the index in a hierarchical manner so that it takes the
The six levels used in this hierarchy are depicted in the following figure 
form of a layered artery structure 
An example is the hierarchical directory system used by many of the operating system for organizing
the file storage 
This technique of file management is known as indexed sequential access method or ISAM 
Advantages of indexed sequential files- they can be used efficiently for sequential processing
of high activity ratio applications 
They can be used efficiently for direct access processing of low activity ratio applications 
Disadvantages of sequential files- they require relatively expensive hardware and software
resources because they must be stored on a direct access device like disk, they require
more storage space than other types of files because additional space is needed for index files 
The bit is the smallest item of data and the combination of multiple related bits is called
When used for direct access online applications, access to records maybe slower than direct files 
Hashed Files- even though indexing provides relatively quick access to entries within
a data storage structure it has the expense of index maintenance 
A similar technique with less overhead is known as hashing 
Like indexed files hashing allows a record to be located with a key value but rather
than looking up the key in an index file hashing identifies the location of the record directly
from the key 
In the hash system, the data storage space is divided into several sections called buckets 
A bucket is capable of holding several records 
The records are dispersed among the buckets according to some algorithm that converts
a character or byte 
key value into bucket numbers 
This conversion from key values to bucket numbers is called a hash function 
Each record is store in the bucket identified by this process 
Thus a record that has been placed in the storage structure can be retrieved by first
applying the hash function to the records identifying key to determine the appropriate
bucket, then retrieve in the condense of that bucket and finally searching through the data
retrieved for the desired record 
Hashing is a technique used to retrieve the data from both mass storage and main memory 
When hashing is applied in mass storage the result is called a hash file 
And when applied to a storage structure in main memory the result is called a hash table 
A field is a combination of multiple related characters 
Consider a student file in which each record contains information about a single student,
first we establish several available areas of mass storage that will play the role of buckets 
The number and size of buckets are designed decisions 
Now, assume that we have forty-one buckets refer to as bucket zero, bucket one, etcetera
bucket forty 
Suppose, student register number is used as the key for identifying student’s record,
we have to develop a hash function for converting these keys into bucket numbers 
One of the simplest functions is to divide the key by the number of buckets available
and record the remainder, in this case a number between zero and forty 
Thus, the remainder of the division identifies one of these forty-one buckets 
It is a meaningful collection of related characters and is the smallest logical data entity treated
After that if we need to retrieve a record just apply the hash function to the <?>records
key</?> to identify the bucket and then search the bucket for the required record 
Although hashing function is designed to generate a unique address for each record key value,
in practice, it sometimes maps the key value of two or more records to same storage address 
This phenomenon is called collision 
To control the collision one method is to use a pointer at the address calculated by
the hashing function 
This pointer points to a linked list of addresses containing physical addresses of all records
whose key value is map to the address calculated by the hashing function 
To obtain an efficient hash system the records being stored should be distributed evenly
as a single unit in data processing 
among the buckets 
If a disproportionate number of keys happen to hash to the same bucket, then a disproportionate
number of records will be stored in a single bucket 
This is called clustering and it causes the loss of any benefits gained by hashing 
In order to reduce the chance of clustering the storage area can be divided into any prime
number of buckets because prime number eliminates the possibility of common factors 
Suppose that we have found a hash function that arbitrarily distributes records among
forty-one buckets and we are going to insert new records one at a time 
When the first record is inserted that will be inserted into an empty bucket 
When we insert the next record only forty of the forty-one buckets are empty, so the
A combination of different related fields is referred to as a record 
In this module we are going to see the file structures 
probability that the second record will be placed in an empty bucket is only forty by
forty-one 
Assuming that the second record is placed in an empty bucket, the probability for the
third record to be placed in an empty bucket is thirty-nine by forty-one 
The probability that all the first eight records will be placed in empty buckets, is forty-one
by forty-one into forty by forty-one into thirty-nine by forty-one, etcetera into thirty-four
by forty-one which is equal to zero point four eight two 
That is, it is more likely than not that in distributing records among forty-one buckets
a collision will have occurred by the time the eighth record is store 
The high probability of collision indicates that regardless of how well chosen a hash
Multiple records are combined to form a file, each record in a file is identified by a key
function might be there is a chance for clustering 
It is possible that a bucket might fill up and over flow 
One solution to this problem is to allow the buckets to expand in size 
And other approach is to allow buckets to spill into an over flow area that has been
reserved for that purpose 
The occurrence of clustering an overflowing buckets can degrade the performance of a hash file 
Research shows that, hash file perform well as long as the ratio of the number of records
to the total record capacity of the file called the load factor remains below fifty percent 
Thus a hash storage system is usually reconstructed with a larger capacity if its load factor
approaches the seventy-five percentage value 
field which contains unique values for every record in the field 
Advantages of hash files- given the key, any record can be quickly located and retrieved directly 
It does not require transactions to be stored in sequence before processing 
It does not require accumulation of transactions in batches before processing them 
They are processed whenever generated 
It can support interactive online applications needed to provide up to the minute information
in response to inquiries from user 
If required, it is also possible to process direct file records sequentially 
Disadvantages of hash files- they require relatively expensive hardware and software
resources because they must be stored on a direct access storage device such as disk 
Due to address generation overhead involved they are less efficient and economical than
A database is an integration of multiple
sequential files for use in sequential application with high activity ratio 
They often require special security and access synchronization mechanisms because online
direct files are generally made accessible simultaneously from multiple online stations 
The role of the operating system- from the user point of view the most important aspect
of a file system is the appearance of the files such as the contents, name, protection
mechanisms and operations possible on files 
But the files are actually managed by the operating system 
The structure, naming, access, use, protection and implementation are done by the operating
system 
The part of the operating system dealing with files is known as file system 
Related files In databases redundancy is reduced 
Implementing files- the main issue in the implementation of the file storage is keeping
track off which disk block go with which file 
Some methods used in different systems are contiguous allocation, linked allocation and
I-node 
Contiguous allocation- in this scheme each file is stored as a contiguous block of data
on the disk 
The advantages of this method are to keep track a file’s blocks only the address of
the first block need to be remembered and the entire file can be read from the disk
in a single operation 
But the difficulties with the allocation are, it is not feasible if the maximum file size
It is a collection of logically related data elements for multiple files 
is not known at the time the file is created and the wastage of disk space 
Linked list allocation- in other method for storing files is to keep each one as a linked
list of disk blocks 
The first word of each block is used as a pointer to the next one, the remaining block
is for data 
Unlike Contiguous allocation no space is lost to disk fragmentation and every block can
be used in this method 
The directory entry needs to store only the disk address of the first block 
The amount of data storage in a block is no longer a power of two because the pointer
takes up some bytes and random access is a slower process 
File oriented approach, in this approach an applications data is organized into one or
But the disadvantages of linked list allocation can be eliminated by taking the pointer block
from each disk block and keeping it in a table or index in memory 
Using this organization, the entire block is available for data 
It makes the random access much easier 
The disadvantage of this method is that the entire table must be in memory all the time 
I-node, the next method for keeping track of which blocks belong to which file is to
keep with each file a small table called I-node or index node, which list the attributes and
disk addresses of the files blocks 
Hence, the operating system has an important role in the creation, opening, closing and
accessing of files and directories 
more files and the application program processes the data stored in these files to generate
In this module an introduction to the file oriented approach of data storage is given 
It presents an idea about the various elements of a data storage hierarchy and then discusses
the various types of files 
Sequential file stores and accesses the records in a serial order while the indexed files
use the help of index to locate a particular file 
Hash system uses an algorithm to map the records to storage locations with reduced number of
collision and clustering 
This module also gives some details about the role of operating system in creating and
maintaining files in the system 
It uses a set of programs called file management system or FMS for this purpose 
decided output 
This module concludes by referring to the various methods of implementing files in a
computer system with the help of the operating system 
Before we conclude please try to answer the following questions, explain the data storage
hierarchy 
What is meant by the file oriented approach?
What are the different types of files supported by the file management system? Briefly explain
the sequential file structure 
List out the merits and demerits of indexed files 
Explain the technique used in hash file system 
What is the importance of operating system in file management?
A master file of permanent data and transaction files of temporary data are used here

Hope you enjoyed this session, see you next time, until then bye 
For example, in a payroll application master file contains all permanent details of each
Today technology is enhanced to store huge amounts of data but traditional file structures
employee such as name, address, code, pay-rate, tax-paid-to-date, total gross-pay to date,
income tax rate, etcetera 
Transaction payroll file contains details of hours work this month, normal working hours,
over time hours, quantity of goods made, etcetera 
Both of these files are used to generate this month’s pay slips and the master file will be updated 
File management system, in a file oriented approach a set of programs called file management
system or FMS provides facilities to organize, create, delete, update and manipulate the files 
A file management system typically supports different types of files such as transaction
file, master file, output file, report file and the backup file, etcetera 
We will see each one of these 
provide many tools which are used as the base for today’s database and the data mining systems 
Transaction files- a transaction file stores input data temporarily until it can be processed 
Master file- a master file contains all current data relevant to an application 
The data stored in it are of more permanent nature 
Output file- some applications use multiple programs for data processing 
In such applications, output of one program maybe the input of another program 
Thus outputs generated intermediately must be stored and output files are used for this purpose 
This output file is accessed by the latter program in the application 
Report File- the report file is used to hold a copy of the report whenever desired 
Report file has advantages over paper documents because files are easier to store and carry 
Backup File- it is a copy of a file, used as a precaution against loss of data due to
The principles of these traditional files structures are discussed here in detail 
corruption or accidental deletion of original file 
Back up files should be created regularly 
Sequential Files- a sequential file is a type of file that is accessed in sequential order
or in serial order from the beginning to the end 
The information in the file is arranged in a long row, audio files, video files, files
containing programs are examples for sequential files 
Most of the files created by a typical personal computer user are sequential files 
Text files are sequential files in which each logical record is a single symbol encoded
using ASCII or uni-code 
The only requirement to construct and elaborate sequential file is to establish a uniform
These structures actually represent the historical beginning of data storage and retrieval systems
format for representing the information about each entity as a string of text 
Then the information is enclosed according to that format and then stores the resulting
records one after the other as one single string of
text  For example, a student file can be constructed by agreeing to end* each student record as
a string of thirty one characters consisting of a field of twenty characters for name followed
by the a field of six characters to represent the student register number followed by a
field of two characters to represent the grade and three characters to represent the rank 
The final file would be a long string of encoded characters in which each thirty-one character
block represents the information about a single student 
Information would be retrieved from the file in terms logical records consisting of thirty-one
from which current database technology has evolved 
character blocks 
Within each of these blocks individual fields would be identified according to the uniform
format with which the blocks were constructed 
File consisting of a sequence of blocks each containing thirty-one characters is given
in the figure 
The data in a sequential files must be recorded in mass storage in such a way that the sequential
nature of the file is preserved 
If the storage system is itself sequential like tapes we need to record the file on the
storage medium according to the sequential properties of the medium 
Processing the file is the task of merely reading and processing the files contents
Many of the techniques developed for these structures like indexing and hashing are used
in the order in which they are found 
In the case of disk storage, the file would be scattered over different sectors that could
be retrieved in a variety of orders 
To preserve the sequential order the file manager of the operating system maintains
a list of sectors on which the file is stored 
The list is stored as a part of the disk directory system 
Hence with the help of this list the operating system can retrieve the sectors in the proper
sequence as though the file will store sequentially 
While processing a sequential file, it is necessary to detect the end of the file is
reached 
as the important tools in the construction of today’s large complex databases 
The end of a sequential file is marked as end of file or EOF 
There are different methods for identifying the end of file 
One method is to place a special record called <?>sentinel</?> at the end of the file 
And the other method is to use the information in the operating system’s directory system
to identify the EOF 
Since the operating system knows which sectors contain the file it also knows where the file
terminates, an example involving sequential files is payroll processing 
Advantages of sequential files- they are simple to understand and use 
They are easy to organize and maintain 
They need relatively inexpensive IO media and devices for their storage and processing 
However, some applications dealing with simple and small data sets are file oriented approaches
The objectives of this module are to get an understanding of the database oriented approach 
data and a set of programs to access those data 
The collection of data is referred by the name database 
The goal of a DBMS is to provide an environment that is both convenient and efficient to use 
The data base management system is the major software component of a database system 
INGRES, ORACLE, Sybase, etcetera are some commercially available DBMS 
It is a combination of software and hardware that can be used to set up and monitor the
database and can also be used for the updating and retrieval of database which is stored in it 
The capabilities of a DBMS include creation, addition, deletion and modification of files
and data 
Retrieving data collectively or
and saving accounts along with other data 
with mathematical functions and maintenance of data integrity, create an environment for
data mining and data warehousing 
A DBMS is served as an interface between the user and databases, when the user request
to retrieve the information from a database, the DBMS of that database processes this request
and presents the required information to the user 
The DBMS can be accessed directly from a terminal or can be coded as high level language programs 
A query is often the request to the DBMS and its responds to a query by invoking the appropriate
subprograms to execute its function to interpret the query 
As said before, the database consist of a collection of a related files of different
If this information are stored as operating system files to allow users to manipulate
types of records and the DBMS helps the users to access the data without giving in background
details, such as the location of the database and the organization of them 
The role of a DBMS can be compared to that of a sales person 
A customer specifies the items he wants to the sales person at the counter 
The sales person retrieves the items from the store and presents it to the customer 
Customer does not have any idea about where these items are stored and how they are actually
organized in the store 
He simply selects the desired items from an alphabetical list and places the order  But
the logical order in the list may not have in a relationship with the actual arrangement
of the goods in the store 
the information the system has a number of application programs like programs to debit
Likewise, a user needs to know only what data he requires, the remaining part is done by
the DBMS 
All the data items about which information is stored in the database are called entities 
The characteristics of entities are called attributes 
These attributes can have simple values like number or text or a picture or some sequence
of sound 
The association among entities in the database is called relationships 
One of the key features of the database approach is the distinction between the logical structure
and physical structure of data 
Logical structure refers to the way in which the programmer sees it and the physical structure
or credit an account, add a new account, find the balance of an account, generate monthly
refers to the way data are actually residing in the storage medium 
Advantages of DBMS- reduction of redundancies, centralized control of data avoids duplication
of data and hence reduces the amount of storage space required 
If there are any redundancies exist in the DBMS they will be controlled and ensures that
these copies are consistent 
Sharing data- DBMS allows the sharing of data among any number of application programs under
some controlled environment 
Data integrity- centralized control also ensures the necessary checks in the DBMS to provide
data integrity which means that the data in the database are accurate and consistent 
Data security- for an organization the data is important, unauthorized access is denied
statement, etcetera 
for the database by implementing proper access procedures and proper authentication schemes
within the DBMS 
Different views of the same database also ensure that unauthorized persons will not
access the confidential data 
Resolution of conflicts- database administrator controls the entire database  The DBA resolves
the conflicting requirements by selecting the best file structure and access
methods to get optimal performance 
Data independence- data independence is of two types, such as physical data independence
and logical data independence 
Physical data independence allows changes in physical organization without requiring
New application programs are added to the system as in when needed 
changes in the external view or conceptual view 
Thus, files can be moved from one physical media to another without affecting the application
programs using this database 
Logical data independence implies that the conceptual schema can be changed without effecting
the existing external schema, that is if fields are added to records or deleted from records
the application programs need not be changed 
This data independence is similar to the concept of abstract data types in modern programming languages 
Both will hide the implementation details from the user 
Disadvantages of DBMS- the DBMS is expensive, it is very costly to develop or purchase the
software, it requires the hardware and workspace to be upgraded 
As a result, the system acquires more files and more application programs 
The processing overhead which involves the mechanisms to implement integration, security
and sharing will degrade the response and throughput times 
The lack of duplication requires the database to be backed up frequently to recover the
data in the case of system failure 
The centralization and security measurements violate the interrupt and operation of the
organization because of the downtimes and failures 
Database languages- a database system provides different types of languages to work with
the databases 
A data definition language or DDL is used to specify the database schema 
And the data manipulation language or DML is used to expressed the database queries
This typical file processing system is supported by a conventional operating system 
and updates 
These two languages are parts of a single database language such as SQL languages 
Data definition language- the data definition language is used to specify the database schema
and additional properties of the data, the storage structure and access methods are specified
by a type of DDL called the data storage and definition language 
These statements define the implementation details that are hidden from the users 
This definition includes all the entities sets, their attributes and the relationships
among these entities 
This definition also include, the constrains that have to be maintained while updating
the database 
The system stores permanent records in various files and different application programs need
The integrity constrains associated with the database system that can be tested with minimal
overhead include domain constrains, referential integrity constrains, assertions and authorization 
The output of the DDL is placed in the data dictionary containing metadata 
The data about data in the database is referred to as metadata 
The data dictionary is in the form of a table that can be accessed and updated only by the
database system itself before reading and modifying actual data 
Data manipulation language- the manipulation language enables the users to access or manipulate
data as organized by the specified data model 
The different types of accesses are insertion of new data, retrieval of information stored
in the database, deletion of data from the data base and modification of the data stored
to extract and add records to files 
To learn about the drawbacks of traditional file oriented approach 
in the database 
There are mainly two types of DML such as procedural DMLs and declarative DMLs 
Procedural DMLs requires a user to specify what data needed and how to get those data,
declarative DMLs or non-procedural DMLs require a user to specify what data are needed without
specifying how to get those data 
A query is a request to retrieve the information, the part of the DML that involves information
retrieval is called a query language 
The query processor component of the database system translates DML queries into sequence
of actions at the physical level of the database systems 
Database architecture- database management systems are complex softwares which were developed
Keeping organizational information in a file processing system has a number of disadvantages
and optimized over years 
From a user’s view point most of them have a similar architecture but the internal structure
of the system varies a lot 
The architecture of a database system is highly depended on the underlying computer system
on which the database system runs 
The database system can be centralized or client server or distributor 
Database systems are generally partitioned into two or three parts 
In a two tier architecture the application is partitioned into a component that resides*
at the climb machine, this will invoke database system functionality at the server machine
with query language systems 
such as, data redundancy and inconsistency, accessing difficulty, data isolation, integrity
Application program interface standards like ODBC and JDBC are used for interaction between
the client and the server 
In a three tier architecture, the climb machine acts as <?>19-06</?> and does not contain
any direct database calls 
The client <?>end</?> communicates with an application server commonly through a form
interface 
The application server then communicates with the database system to access data 
For large applications and for applications that run on the world wide web three-tier
architecture is more appropriate 
The difference between a three-tier architecture and a two-tier architecture can clearly be
problems, atomicity problems, concurrent access anomalies and security and flexibility problems 
identified with the help of the following figure 
Database users- the people who work with databases are categorized mainly into database system users
and database administrators, we will see them in detail 
According to the way of interaction with the system there are four types of database users 
Different types of user interfaces have been designed for the different types of users,
they are native users, application programmers, sophisticated users and specialized users 
Native users, they are unsophisticated users who interact with the system by invoking one
of the application programs that have already been written 
The typical user interface for the native users is forms in which the user can fill
in the appropriate fields to specify the required data, these type of users just read the reports
These difficulties paved the way for database systems 
generated from the database 
Application programmers- the computer professionals who develop application programs come under
this category 
They are free to choose any tools to develop the application or user interfaces 
Rapid application development or RAD tools help the application programmers to write
forms and reports with less programming effort 
Sophisticated users- these types of users interact directly with the system without
writing programs 
They use query languages to specify the queries and then submits this to a query processor 
Specialized users- the sophisticated users who write specialized database applications
Database oriented approach, a database is a system that converts a large collection
rather than traditional data processing are called specialized users 
The CAD systems, knowledge based and expert systems, environment modeling systems, etcetera
are specialized applications whose data sets are of complex types 
The other category is database administrator or DBA 
We know that one of the important reasons for using DBMS is the central control of data
and programs 
A person having a central control of the system is called the DBA or database administrator 
The main functions of the DBA are schema definition, storage structure and access method definition,
modification of schema and physical organization, authority of giving permission for data access,
routine maintenance such as backing up the database, disk space management and monitoring
of data into an abstract tool allowing the users to search for an extract <?>pertain</?>
of running jobs 
Now, we will summarize what we have discussed 
Here an introduction to the database oriented approach is given 
The module starts with a reference to the significant drawbacks of traditional file
systems then it goes through database oriented approach and defines the terms schema and
subschema 
Different level of abstraction in the database such as physical level, logical level and
view level are discussed in detail 
The concept of DBMS such as data abstraction, database languages and database structure
are briefly discussed 
items of information in a manner that is convenient to the user 
The module ends by giving an account of various database users and DBA

Explain the function of a DBA?
Write a note on database architecture 
Explain DDL and DML?
What are the limitations of traditional file systems?
What is meant by DBMS?
Explain the features 
What is meant by schema?

structures for storage of information and providing mechanisms for the manipulation
of information 
To know about the various terms associated with databases 
It should also ensure the safety of the information stored from system crashes or unauthorized access 
Information is important as far as the organization is concern 
Hence, a large number of concepts and techniques are developed for managing data 
Nowadays databases are widely used 
Some important applications are for reservation and scheduling information of airlines, to
manage the student information in universities 
Banking information management, in telecommunication to keep the call records, to generate monthly
bills and to store the communication network information 
In finance for storing information about holding, sales and purchases of financial instruments
such as bonds and stocks 
To learn about the various database languages 
In human resource management to keep the information about employees, salaries, payroll, taxes, etcetera 
The increased use of internet increased the direct user access to databases 
Many of the organizations converted their phone interfaces to web interfaces and made
a variety of services and information available online 
Even though user interfaces hide details of access to a database and the people are not
aware of their dealing with a database, accessing database forms and essential part of day to
day life of almost everyone 
Oracle a database system vendor is one of the largest software companies in the world
today which shows the importance of database systems now 
Schemas, historically computers were used in information management with large collection
To understand the different types of uses 
of data 
If the different but related items were restored in separate systems, much of the information
required by an organization was duplicated throughout the company 
The database systems emerged to integrate the information stored by a particular organization 
But the data integration has the disadvantages like sensitive data may be accessed by an
unauthorized user, etcetera 
Hence, control to access the information as well as the sharing information in the database
is important 
To provide different uses different information within the same database, database system
uses schemas and subschemas 
The term database refers to a collection of data that is multidimensional in the sense
A schema defines the overall design whereas a subschema defines only a portion of the
database specifying a particular users needs 
The collection of information stored in the database at a particular time is called an
instance of the database 
The overall design of the database is called database schema 
Database systems have several schemas according to the level of abstraction 
The physical schema describes the database design at the physical level 
The logical schema describes the database design at the logical level and the subschema
describes the different views of the database 
The logical schema is the important of these three because the programmers develop applications
that internal links between its entries make the information accessible from a variety
by using the logical schema 
The physical schema is lying under the logical schema and hence not much affects the application program 
Data abstraction, a database system is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs
that allow users to access and modify this data 
The database system provides users only an abstract view of data by hiding the inner
complexities of storing and maintaining it 
There are different levels of abstraction as far as the users of the database systems
are concerned 
Physical level- this is the lowest level of abstraction and describes how the data are
actually stored 
of perspective 
It describes the details of low level data structure 
Logical level- the next higher level of abstraction is at logical level 
It describes what data are stored in the database and what the relationships among those data are  Database
administrators use the logical level of abstraction because they decide what information
to keep in the database 
View level- the highest level of abstraction is possible in view level 
The view level describes only a part of the entire database 
This level is provided to simplify the interactions with the system 
The same database can be viewed in different ways 
At the physical level a student record can be described as a block of consecutive storage locations
Database systems arose in response to early methods of computerized management of commercial data 
like bytes or <?>words</?> 
These details are hidden from the programmers, the physical organization of the database
maybe not only to the administrators 
At the logical level each such record is described by a type of definition and the relationship
maybe defined 
In the view level, computer users see a set of application programs in which the details
of data types are hidden 
The views also provide a security mechanism to prevent users from accessing certain parts
of the database 
Database management system- a database management system or DBMS is a collection of interrelated
For example, consider a part of a bank enterprise that keeps information about all customers
Welcome back, in this module we are going to discuss Database Management System Implementation 
Hence the structure of a network database is extremely complicated in which one record
can be used as a key of the entire database 
It is structured in the form of a graph and high level language such as Pascal, Cobol,
etcetera, were used to implement the records and to set structures 
Hierarchical data model, in a hierarchical DBMS the relationships among data in the database
are established in such a way that one data item is present as the sub ordinate of another one 
This will have parent child relationship among them 
Tree is used to structure this type of database and backward moment is not possible in the
hierarchical database 
All the DBMS such as dbase, FoxPro, etcetera, are hierarchical and not used nowadays 
In the early two thousand, the XML and the associated query language XQuery were emerged
Relational model, a DBMS is said to be a relational DBMS or RDBMS if the database relationships
are treated in the form of a table 
The main keys of relational DBMS are relation, domain and attributes 
The relational model uses a collection of table to represent both data and relationships
among those data 
It is the most widely used data model and a majority of the current database systems
are based on the relational model 
Some examples are Oracle, Sybase, Ingres, Microsoft SQL server, Microsoft Access, etcetera 
Entity-relationship model, it is based on a perception of a real word consisting of
a collection of basic objects called entities and relationship among these entities 
as new database technologies 
Object based data model, the object based model can be considered as an extension of
the entity relationship model 
The term object oriented database system is used to refer database systems that support
an object based type system and allow direct access to data from an object oriented programming
language using the native type system of the language 
Semi structured data model, the semi structured data model permits the specification of data
where individual data items of the same type may have different sets of attributes 
The extensible markup language or XML is widely used to represent semi structured data 
The relational model, in this section the relational database model is explained in detail 
It shows data as being stored in rectangular table called relations like those in spreadsheet applications 
To minimize the system administration efforts, autonomic computers or auto admin techniques
A row in a relation is called a tuple, some say it is tuple or some other as tuple 
Tuple consist of information about a particular entity 
Columns in a relation are called attributes because each entry in a column describes some
characteristics or attributes of the entity represented by the corresponding tuple 
Issues of relational design, the first step in designing a relational database is to design
the relations making up the database 
The typical employee information would consist of Emp id, name, address, and social security number 
Suppose we need to contain information about jobs of the employees 
A job history also should be added consisting of attributes, job title, job identification
code, skill code associated with each job, the department, starting date and termination
were evolved 
date of the job, etcetera 
The simplest approach is to extend the relation given earlier to include these additional
attributes as given here 
But this method has several problems, this may contain redundant values, the relation
may no longer contain one tuple for each employee but one tuple for each job assignment of an employee 
Multiple jobs were assigned to one employee several tuples in new relation must contain
the same information about the employee such as name, address, ID and social security number 
For example, in the given relation the personal information about Nehal and Smita is repeated
because they have held more than one job 
When a particular position has been held by numerous employees, the department associated
Hence in this module we will have a look at the implementation details of a DBMS along
with that job along with the appropriate skill code must be repeated in each tuple representing
an assignment of the job 
But the serious problem with the new extended relation is when we delete any information
from the database 
For example, Nehal is the only employee to hold the job identified as D seven 
If he left the company and was deleted from the database 
We may lose the information about the job D seven 
If we can partially erase the tuple, this problem can be solved 
But this may introduce more severe problems 
The reason for all these problems is that here we have combined more than one concept
with the merits and demerits of the relational model 
in a single relation 
We can say that the extended relation given here consist of personal information of the
employees, information about the jobs available in the company and information regarding the
relationships between employees and jobs 
Hence this problem can be solved by redesigning the database system using three relations 
One relation is the employee relation which is same as our first relation consisting of
personal details of the employees 
Another is the job relation consisting of the information about the available jobs in
the company 
Yet another relation can be designed to keep the relationship between employees and job
Layered approach to database implementation, a typical database application involves two
with an assignment relation 
The three relations will jointly produce all the information contained in the extended relation 
The employee database consisting of these three relations is depicted in the figure 
If we know the employee’s identification number, the department in which employee has
worked can be found by first finding all the jobs that employee has held using the job
assignment relation and then finding the departments associated with those jobs with the help of
job relation 
Even though we solved the problem very easily it has some troubles in dividing information
into various relations 
Sometimes dividing information into smaller relations causes the loss of information and
software layers such as an application layer and a database management layer as shown here 
sometimes it does not 
These are known as lossy decomposition and lossless decomposition or non-lossy decomposition respectively 
These are the important characteristics while designing a database 
Relational operations, to understand the basics of data organization and relational model
first we need to have a clear knowledge about how information can be extracted from a database
consisting of relations 
The fundamental operations of relational algebra are categorized as unary and binary 
Select, project and rename operations are called unary operations and union, difference,
Cartesian product, join, etcetera, are called binary operations 
There are also some other operations such as aggregate operations, self-intersection
The application software manages the communication with the user of the database or some other software 
assignment, etcetera 
We will now examine the important of these such as select, project and join 
The select operation, the select operation selects tuples that satisfy a given predicate 
For example, if we want to select the tuple with the appropriate identification attribute
value from the employee relation or to obtain a list of the job titles in a certain department,
we must select the tuples from the job relation having that department as their department
attribute 
To express this operation the syntax used is new becomes select from employee where
Emp id equals “two four B four one” 
This statement implies that a new relation called a new is created which contain those
Anyway the application software determines the systems external characteristics 
The way of data processing helped a lot for the development or the growth of computers
tuples from the relation employee whose Emp id attribute has value equal to “two four
B four one” 
The select operation results as given below 
The comparisons using equal to, not equal to, less than, less than or equal to, greater
than, greater than or equal to are allowed in the selection predicate 
In a sense the select operation extract the rows from a relation which satisfies a specified
predicate or condition 
The project operation, the project operation returns its argument relation with certain
attributes left out 
A relation is a set and hence the duplicate rows are eliminated 
The communication with the user may be in text based format or a graphical user interface
In contrast to the select operation, the project operation extracts columns from a relation 
For example, we want to get the job titles in a certain company, we can get it by retrieving
the information of job title column in the jobs relation 
The project operation allows extracting this column and placing the result in a new relation,
it can be expressed as new two becomes project job title from jobs 
The result is the creation of a new relation called new two that contains a single column
of values from the job title column of jobs relation 
The project operation can also be used to extract a list of columns by listing the columns
in the project operation 
For example, new relation becomes project name, address from employee can be used to
or GUI 
get a listing of the names and address of all employees 
The join operation, another operation used in conjunction with relational databases is
the join operation 
This can be used to combine different relations into one relation 
The join produces a new relation whose attribute consist of the attributes from the original
relation 
The names of these attributes are the same as those in the original relation with a prefix
to indicate the original relation 
That is if a relation A containing attributes P and Q is joined with a relation B containing
attributes X, Y and Z, the resultant relation will be having five attributes called A dot
The application software determines what action the user is requesting and then uses the database
P, A dot Q, B dot X, B dot Y and B dot Z 
This property ensures that the attributes in the new relation have unique names even
though the original relations might contain same attributes names 
SQL, the database are generally stored in mass storage system 
In order to relieve the application programmer from the details of these systems as database
management system based on some data model is provided 
The DBMS accepts commands in terms of the model and converts them into actions relative
to the actual storage structure 
Thus a DBMS based on the relational model should be able perform the relational operations
such as Select, Project and Join 
management system or the DBMS to achieve the results 
These are called from the application program 
Today’s relational DBMS provide routines better combinations of the Select, Project
and Join 
The <?>19-57*</?> has standardizes the SQL and it is the underlying language of the database
system my SQL 
SQL needs only a description about the required information, the algorithms for the manipulation
of relations will be developed by the DBMS 
The SQL has several parts called data definition language or DDL, Data manipulation language
or DML and Data control language or DCL 
The SQL consist of statements for defining the structure of relations, creating relations,
It will not directly manipulate the database 
modifying the contents of relations and performing queries 
For example, select Emp Id, department from job assignment, job where assignment dot job
Id equal to job dot job Id and assignment dot term date equal to star 
In this SQL queries statement there are three closures such as, a select, a from and the
<?>under where class</?> 
It is a request for the result of forming the joint of all the relations listed in from
the <?>class</?> selecting those tuples that satisfy the condition in the <?>where class</?>
and then projecting the tuples listed in the select <?>class</?> 
Now, we can summarize the session 
In this module a database system based on the relational model is given with it features
If the user requests the application software to add or delete data, the DBMS actually alters
and issues of design 
This module also provides a brief description about the layered approach of database and
the distributed database 
In this module we have covered the basic relational operations such as select, project and join 
The module concludes by referring to a query language called structured query language
which is a popular language used with most of the relational DBMS

Hope you enjoyed the session, see you next time until then good bye 
This distinction has several advantages 
It allows the construction and use of abstract tools which is needed to simplify the software
designed process 
into a form which it possesses now 
Since the actual organization of the database is concerned by DBMS alone application software
can be simplified 
Even if the database is stored on a single machine or distributed among many machines
it is not necessary for application software to take care off 
Another advantage of separating the application software from the DBMS is that an organization
provides a means for controlling access to the database 
The database management system can enforce the restriction imposed by the various sub
schemas and it can be use the entire database schema for its internal needs 
Yet in other advantage of the separated layers is to achieve data independence 
As we have already discussed, data independence is the ability to change the organization
During nineteen sixties and seventies the scenario of data processing had a significant
of the database without changing application software 
Suppose the personal department need to add an additional field to employee record those
changes may require modification to the application programs if the database are directly associated
with application software 
The separation between the application software and the DBMS removes the need for such modification
or reprograming to implement a change in the database required by the personal department
one needs to change the overall schema and the sub schema of those users involved in
the change 
The sub schemas of all other users remain the same and hence the application software
of unaltered sub schemas does not need to be modified 
change in such a way that the programmers could use data structures such as list entries
Usually the application software acts as the client and the database management layer plays
the role of a server 
Distributed databases, with the advancement of networking capabilities database system
have improved to some distributed ones 
In these systems data resides on different machines 
A distributed database might contain fragmented or replicated data, in parallel systems the
processes are tightly coupled and constitute a single database system but in distributed
systems the sites that share no physical components are loosely coupled 
The distributed database can be classified as either homogeneous or heterogeneous 
In a homogeneous distributed database system all sites have identical database management
to free the data from the domination of sequential techniques 
system software they were aware of one another and agree to cooperate in processing users
request 
In a heterogeneous distributed database, different sites may use different schemas, and different
database management system software 
The sites may not be aware of one another and may provide only limited facilities for
cooperation in transaction processing 
As mentioned earlier the two approaches to store a relation are in the distributed database
are replication and fragmentation 
In replication the system maintains several identical copies or replicas of the relation
and stores each replica at a different site 
By that time the relational models and non-procedural <?>queering</?> were defined by code which
In fragmentation the system partitions the relation into several fragments and stores
each fragment at a different site 
In the distributed database system each site maintains a local database system 
Each site is able to process local transaction which access data in only that single site 
A site may also participate in the execution of global transaction which access data in
several sites 
In the distributed database system, each site maintains a local database system 
Each site is able to process local transactions which access data in only that single site 
A site may also participate in the execution of global transactions which access data in
several sites 
helps to hide the implementation details absolutely from programmers 
For the successful execution of global transaction communication among the sites is required 
A distributed system may suffer from a large number of failures 
The failure of a site, the failure of a link, loss of a message and network are some of
the additional issues to be dealt than that of centralized system 
Database models, the conceptual view of the database is called database model 
The routines require to translate commands stated in terms of a conceptual view of the
database into actions required by the actual data storage system are contain within a DBMS 
The search for better database model is an ongoing process 
These researchers are aim at finding models that allow complex data system to be conceptualizing
easily and to produce efficient database management systems 
By nineteen eighties heavy researchers were carried out on parallel and distributed databases
The collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics and
consistency constraints are contained within the data models 
The data models provide the way to describe the design of a database at the view, logical
and physical levels 
The data models can be classified as network data model, hierarchical data model, relational
data model, the Entity-Relationship model, object based data model and semi structured
data model, etcetera 
Now, we’ll see each one of these 
Network data model, a DBMS is said to be network DBMS if the relationships among the data in
the database are of type many to many 
along with the introduction of object oriented databases 
Welcome friends, in this module we will see Object Oriented Database 
Objects have a many to many relationship and are accessed with help of pointers 
Pointers are linked to objects to establish relationships 
Another benefit of an ODBMS is that it can be programmed with small procedural changes
without affecting the entire system 
This feature helps those organizations which have data relationships that are not entirely
clear or need to change these relations to satisfy the new business requirements 
The object oriented approach to the design of the database allows the entire software
system to be designed in the same paradigm 
The historical approach is to use an imperative programming language to develop application
software for relational database 
An object from employee class contain entries such as start date and term date 
An object oriented database combine with an object oriented application program produces
a homogenous image of objects communicating with each other throughout the system 
But a relational database combine with an imperative application program provides an
image to inherently different organization trying to find a common interface 
Another thing for comparison is the relational counter parts of the database 
While storing names in an employee database, if the entire name is stored as a single attribute
in a relation then enquiries regarding only last names are not so appreciable 
But if the name is stored as three stored separate attributes such as first name, middle
name and last name then it is difficult to deal with people whose names do not confirm
to the first name, middle name and the last name template 
The object oriented database, a conceptual representation of the above mentioned database
In object oriented database these difficulties can be solved easily 
An employee name can be stored as an intelligent object that is capable of reporting the related
employees name in a variety of formats 
Hence, from outside these objects it would be just easy to deal with last names only
as with entire names 
The details involved with each perspective would be encapsulated within the object 
In a relational database the attributes in a relation are part of the overall design
of the database 
So, the types associated with these attributes flow to the entire DBMS 
Thus, extending the relational database to include attributes of new types may lead to
is shown in the figure 
a problematic situation 
But in an object oriented design the procedure can be used with different objects because
the distinction in types can be hidden 
Another advantage of the object oriented paradigm is the potential for storing intelligent objects
rather than merely data 
An object can contain methods describing how it should respond to messages regarding its
contents and relationships 
This ability to construct databases whose components respond intelligently to inquiries
offers a large number of possibilities than that of relational databases 
The advantages and disadvantages of an object oriented database in view of the relational
Here the links between the various objects are shown by lines connecting the related objects 
database can be listed as follows 
Advantages, objects don’t require execution time to assemble or disassemble objects 
Reduced paging, easier navigation, better concurrency control, data model is based on
the real world, works well for distributed architectures, less code required when applications
are object oriented 
Disadvantages, lower efficiency when data is simple and relationships are simple 
Relational tables are simpler 
Late binding may slow access speed 
More user tools exist for RDBMS 
Standards for RDBMS are more stable 
These links are stored and maintained by the DBMS, so the programmer who writes application
Support for RDBMS is more certain and change is less likely to be required 
The object oriented database query, object oriented databases use query language like
SQL to express the queries which is called as object query language or OQL 
OQL supports all the mandatory features or characteristics of ODBMS to make efficient
object database systems 
Its supports more complex data objects, path expressions, operation invocation, inheritance,
object extensions for object identity, etcetera 
OQL is a very efficient way of expressing object queries, it keeps objects integrity
by using implemented methods rather than its on operations 
OQL can also be embedded in other languages like C plus plus and Java 
software is free of considering the implementation details of these links 
OQL can be defined as a functional or expression-oriented language, in which each query is a typed expression 
Type can be atomic object, collection object or literal 
OQL doesn’t have explicit update operations like insert, delete, update database but as
an alternative it can invoke state altering methods create, add and delete, etcetera to
get similar functions 
For example, employee name Sanjana, birth data ten nine nineteen eighty-five, salary
twenty-five thousand creates a new employee object with necessary attributes data 
Like SQL we can write separate functions to perform certain task 
Polymorphism, OQL supports the polymorphism feature of the object oriented programming paradigm 
The various classes can have same attributes and method implementations which are in same hierarchy 
When a new object is added to the database the application software merely specifies
For example, the employee class has attribute named activities, implemented as an array
of strings, its subclass manager also has a method named activities, that overwrites
inheritance of the employee attribute 
Maintaining database integrity, the database management systems for personal use are inexpensive
and simple systems 
They hide the implementation details of the system from the users 
When a problem arises the user can correct it directly or reload the database from a
backup copy and manually make up the modifications 
This might be an inconvenient process and is restricted to only a few people 
In case of large multiuser commercial database systems, the cost of incorrect or lose data
the other objects to which it should be linked 
can be enormous and can have unpredictable consequences 
Hence an important role of the DBMS is to maintain the databases integrity by securing
against problem such as partially completed operations or operations producing inaccurate
information in the database 
Next we will this function of the DBMS 
The commit rollback protocol, a single transaction such as fund transfer from one bank to another,
registration of a student to some university course, etcetera may have multiple steps at
the database level 
For example, the fund transfer needs balance in one bank account to be decremented and
the balance in the other account to be incremented accordingly 
The object oriented DBMS should also provide permanent storage for the objects entrusted
Between these steps, the information in the database is inconsistent that is the funds
are missing during the short period after the first account is decremented but before
the second is incremented 
In the case of large databases involving heavy transaction loads we can find the database
in the middle of some transaction 
A request for the execution of a transaction or an equipment failure may occur at a time,
when the database is an inconsistent state 
The goal of the DBMS is not to freeze the database in an inconsistent state 
This is accomplished generally by maintaining a list, generally called log containing a
record of each transactions activities in a non-volatile storage system 
to it 
DBMS have been widely used in data processing environment since nineteen sixties because
Before a transaction is allowed to alter the database, the alteration to be performed will
be recorded in the list 
Hence the list contains every action of the transaction 
The point at which all the steps in a transaction have been recorded in the log is called the
commit point 
At this point the DBMS becomes committed to the transaction by guaranteeing that the transactions
activities will be reflected in the database 
In the case of equipment failure, the DBMS can use the information in its log to reconstruct
the transactions that have been completed since the last backup was made 
If problems arise before the transaction has reached its commit point, the DBMS might find
In normal situations when an object oriented program is executed, the objects created during
itself with a partially executed transaction 
In this case, the log can be used to roll back the actions performed by the transaction 
Sometimes the rolling back of one transaction might affect the database entries that have
been used by other transactions 
This means that these additional transactions must also be rolled back which may affect
still other transactions 
This problem is known as cascading rollback 
Locking, the other problem associated with the DBMS is the partial operations which produce
erroneous results 
This is called incorrect summary problem 
the program’s execution are discarded when the program terminates 
Suppose one transaction is in the middle of transferring funds from one account to another,
while another transaction is computing the total deposits in the bank 
This may results in a total that is either too large or too small depending on the order
of these transactions 
Another problem is the lost update problem which is exemplified by two transactions,
each of which makes a deduction from the same account 
If one of the transactions reads the account’s current balance at the point when the other
has just read the balance but not yet calculated the new balance 
Here both transactions will base their deductions on the same initial balance in which one of
the deductions will not be reflected in the database 
But objects created and added to a database must be saved even after the termination of
To solve such problems a DBMS could force transactions to execute in their integrity
or on a one at a time basis by holding the new transactions in a queue until those proceeding
it have completed 
But a transaction may need to wait for a long time for the operations to be performed 
Hence large DBMS contain a scheduler to coordinate time sharing among transactions in the same
way as time sharing operating system coordinates the processes 
To protect against the incorrect summary problem and the lost update problem, the schedulers
incorporate a locking protocol in which the items within the database, currently being
used by some transactions are marked as such 
These marks are called locks and the marked items are said to be locked 
the program 
Two common types of locks are shared locks and exclusive locks 
If a transaction is not going to alter a data item, then it requires a shared access but
if there is any alteration to the item it must have exclusive access 
Different algorithms are used to handle the cases in which a transactions access request
is rejected 
The simplest algorithm is that the transaction is merely forced to wait until the requested
item becomes available 
But this may lead to dead lock 
In order to avoid dead lock, some DBMS give priority to older transactions 
Hence if an older transaction requires access to an item that is locked by a younger transaction,
Hence the objects in the database are persistent 
the younger transaction is forced to release the data items and its activities are rolled back 
If a younger transaction is repeatedly preempted, it will grow older and will be one among the
older transactions 
This protocol is called wound wait protocol and will ensure that every transaction will
be allowed to complete its task 
Now, it’s time to summarize the session 
In this module, an object oriented database system and its advantages over the traditional
relational model are discussed in detail 
This module gives an account of the characteristics of ODBMS and OQL 
The module ends by referring to the integrity issues of the DBMS and methods to solve these
If you are making an object oriented programing language into a database programing language,
problems like commit, roll back, locking and wound wait protocol

Hope you enjoyed the session, see you next time until then good bye 
There are different approaches for this and are listed below 
Persistence by class, the simplest but most inconvenient way is to declare that a class
is persistent 
of the characteristics such as data sharing, independence, consistency and integrity which
When by default all objects of the class are persistent 
Persistence by creation, here new syntax is introduced to create persistent objects 
An object is said to be either persistent or transient depending on the way of creation 
Persistence by marking, in this approach after the creation of the objects they are marked
as persistent, all object are created as transient objects 
But if an object is persist, beyond the execution of the program it must be marked explicitly
as persistent before the program terminates 
Persistence by reachability, one or more objects are explicitly declared as root or persistent objects 
The other objects are persistent if and only if they are reachable from root object through
a sequence of one or more references 
the traditional file systems lack 
There are different methods to find an object in the database, one method is to give names
to objects as names given to files 
And other method is to expose object identifiers or persistent pointers to the objects which
can be stored externally 
Yet another way is to store collections of object 
These objects can be modelled as objects of a collection type, most object oriented database systems
support all the three ways to access persistent object 
Characteristics of ODBMS, the database system should satisfy certain characteristics to
be an object database 
They are, encapsulation, types, classes, inheritance, complex objects, object identity, extensibility,
An object database or object oriented database management system is a database management
persistence, overloading, overriding, computational completeness, storage management, concurrency
and recovery 
Encapsulation, encapsulation can be viewed either in programing language view or the
database adaptation of that view 
Encapsulation is the representation of the data object by its attributes and the associated
methods specify to manipulate those data objects 
Here the operations performed on the data objects are visible 
But the data and the implementation are hidden 
Types and classes, type refers to the particular set of objects in the system consisting of
interface and the implementations 
system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object oriented programing 
Generally, interfaces are visible to the user and the implementations are hidden 
Class is a template for creating the objects of a particular type having there on implementations 
The new objects can be created by performing new operation on the class 
Inheritance, inheritance is the most important feature of the object database, which specifies
the hierarchical relationships between different objects at different levels and give core reusability 
There are different types of inheritance like substitution inheritance, constraint inheritance,
inclusion inheritance and specialization inheritance 
Complex objects, complex objects are built by using the basic data objects like integers,
strings, real numbers and Boolean 
There are various complex data objects such as array, list, index, tuples, etcetera 
The term object oriented database system first appeared around nineteen eighty-five and notable
User can define methods to manipulate these new complex types 
Object identity, it is a very important issue in database, each object has to be uniquely
identified from the whole database or similar kinds of objects 
Each object has a unique identity and we can access and edit the object by using this 
It can be variable name or a physical address space in memory 
Extensibility, database system has its own predefined set of data types using which we
can write new types and there is no usage difference between the built in types and
the user defined type 
But there may be strong difference in the way to a supported 
Persistence, it is the ability of system data to preserve or survive during execution so
research projects included Encore-Ob Server, IRIS, ODE, ORION, etcetera 
that it can be further used by another process 
Persistency provides the reusability 
Overriding and overloading, they use the same name for implementing the object methods or
operations to represent the same data in different ways 
Computational completeness, this property says that we can define or implement any kind
of computable function for the ODB using DML of database system 
Computational complete system gives almost all of the operation implementation 
Secondary storage management, the data in system is managed so as to get the quick and
easier access, it is supported using different techniques including data clustering, indexing,
query optimization, data buffering and access part section 
For example, an object oriented implementation of the employee database consists of three
But these are invisible to users, it has two levels of management such as logical and physical 
Concurrency, when a large number of users are interacting with the database the system
must provide same level of service to all the users 
It should avoid the system failure, incomplete transactions, etcetera 
The techniques for this come under concurrency 
Recovery, the system should be able to recover itself to original state if it suffers from
the hardware or software failures 
RDBMS verses ODBMS, an object oriented database stores complex data and relationships between
data directly without mapping to relational rows and columns 
And this make them suitable for applications dealing with very complex data 
classes or three types of objects such as employee, job and job assignment 
Welcome
If there is a violation in any of the constraints operation will fail 
Domain Constraints  These are attribute level constraints, an attribute can only take values
which lie inside the domain range  Example, if a constraints age great than zero is applied
on student relation, inserting negative value of age will result in failure 
Key Integrity  Every relation in the database should have at least one set of attributes
which defines a tuple uniquely  Those set of attributes is called key  Example, serial
number in student is a key, no two students can have the same role number or serial number,
Referential Integrity  When one attribute of a relation can only take values from other
attribute of same relation or any other relation it is called referential integrity  Let us
All the data is represented in terms of tuples grouped into relations  A database organized
suppose we have two relations, one student table with fields serial number, name, place
phone, age and branch code 
And another table branch with branch code and branch name  Branch code of student can
only take the values which are present in branch code of branch, which is called referential
integrity constraint  The relation which is referencing to other relation is called referencing
relation, student in this case and the relation to which other relations refer is called referenced
relation, in this case branch 
Anomalies  An anomaly is an irregularity or something which deviates from the expected
or normal state  When designing database we identify three types of anomalies, insert,
update and delete  An update anomaly is a data inconsistency that results from data
in terms of the relational model is a relational database  The greatest strength of the relational
redundancy and a partial update  For example, each student in the college has a department
associated with them and a student group  If the use of performing the update does not
realize that the data is stored redundantly the update will not be done properly 
A deletion anomaly is the unintended loss of data due to deletion of other data  If
any of the fields are deleted from the table, the other data related to the field also may
be deleted  This results in database inconsistencies  An insertion anomaly is the inability to add
to the data to the database due to absence of other data  If any of the attribute value
is missing for some data that cannot be included in the database, these three anomalies are
undesirable in any database and can be avoided by the process of normalization 
Normalization is a database design technique which organizes tables in a manner that reduces
model is the simple logical structure that it forms  Other kinds of software besides
redundancy and dependency of data  It divides larger tables to smaller tables and links
them using relationships 
Insertion Anomaly in Referencing Relation  We can’t insert a row in referencing relation,
if referencing attributes value is not present in referenced attribute value  Example, insertion
of a student with BRANCH_CODE ‘ME’ in STUDENT relation will result in error because
‘ME’ is not present in BRANCH_CODE of BRANCH 
Deletion or Updation Anomaly in Referenced Relation  We can't delete or update a row
from referenced relation if value of referenced attribute is used in values of referencing
attribute  Example, if we try to delete tuple from BRANCH having BRANCH_CODE ‘CS’ it
will automatically in error because ‘CS’ is referenced by BRANCH_CODE of STUDENT, but
database systems can make good use of tables of information as well 
if we try to delete the row from BRANCH with BRANCH_CODE EE it will be deleted as the value
is not been used by referencing relation 
It can be handled by following method  ON DELETE CASCADE  It well delete the tuples
from referencing relation if value used by referencing attribute is deleted from referenced
relation  Example, if we delete a row from BRANCH with BRANCH_CODE ‘CS’ the rows
in student relation with BRANCH_CODE CS that is row number four and six in this case will be deleted 
ON UPDATE CASCADE  It will update the referencing attribute in referencing relation, if attribute
value used by referencing attribute is updated in referenced relation  Example, if we update
a row from BRANCH with BRAND_CODE CS to ‘CSE’, the rows in the STUDENT relation with BRANCH_CODE
‘CS’, that is roll number one and two in this case will be updated with BRANCH_CODE ‘CSE’ 
And the relational data model helps us design these tables and develop the data structures
Super Keys  Any set of attributes that allows us to identify unique rows or tuples in a
given relation are known as Super Keys  Out of the Super Keys we can always have a proper
subset which can be used as primary key  Such keys are known as candidate keys  If there
is a combination of two or more attributes which is being used as the primary key, then
we call it as a composite key 
In this module relational database model and its characteristics are discussed in detail 
This module gives an account of the fundamental concepts in relational model  The module ends
by referencing various constraints in relational model and different anomalies which deviates
the relational models from the expected state  Hope you enjoyed the session, see you next
time, until then bye 
that we need to assess them efficiently  For example, such tables are used by compilers
to store information about the variables used in the program keeping track of their data
type and of the functions for which they are defined 
Relational Model Concepts, relational model represents how data is stored in relational
data basis  A relation also known as table or file is a subset of the Cartesian product
to the session on Relational Data Model 
of a list of domains characterized by a name and within a table each row represents a group
of related data values, a row or record is also known as a tuple  The columns in a table
are referred to as fields or attributes  You can also think of it this way 
An attribute is used to define the record and a record contains a set of attributes 
The steps below outlined the logic between a relation and its domains  Given n domains
are denoted by D one, D two, etcetera Dn  And R is a relation defined on these domains 
Then r is a subset of D one cross D two cross etcetera cross Dn 
A database is composed of multiple tables and each table holds the data  Following figure
shows a database that contains three tables  A database stores pieces of information or
facts in an organized way, understanding how to use and get the most out of the database
One of the most important applications of computers
requires us to understand that method of organization 
The principal storage units are called columns or fields or attributes, this house the basic
components of data into which your content can be broken down  When deciding which field
to create, you need to think generically about your information  For example, drawing out
the common components of the information that you will store in the database and avoiding
the specifics that distinguished one item from another 
Look at the example of an ID card in the following figure to see the relationship between fields
and their data  A domain is the original sets of atomic values used to model data  By atomic
value we mean that each value in the domain is invisible as far as the relational model
is concerned  For example, the domain of marital status has a set of possibilities, married,
is storing and managing information  The manner in which information is organized to have
single or divorced 
The domain of shift has the set of all possible days Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday etcetera 
The domain of salary is the set of all floating point numbers greater than zero and less than
two lakh  The domain of First Name is the set of character strings that represents names
of people  In summary, a domain is a set of acceptable values that a column is allowed
to contain  This is based on various properties and the data type for the column 
Just as the content of anyone document or item needs to be broken down into its constituent
bits of data for storage in the fields  The link between them also needs to be available
so that they can be reconstituted into their whole form  Records allow us to do this 
Records contain fields that are related, such as a customer or an employee, as noted earlier
an important role on how easily it can be assessed and managed 
a tuple is another term used to for record  Records and fields form the basis of all databases 
A simple table gives the clearest picture of how records and fields work together in
a database storage project  The simple table example in figure shows us how fields can
hold a range of different sorts of data  This one has a record ID field, this is an ordinal
number, its data type is integer  A PubDate field this is displayed as day, month, year,
its data type is date and author field this is displayed as initial Surname, its data
type is text  A Title field text, free text can be entered here 
You can command the database to shift through its data and organized it in a particular
way  For example, you can request that a selection of records be limited by date, one, all before
a given date, two, all after given date or three, all between two given dates  Similarly,
Relational data model is the primary data model, which is used widely around the world
you can choose to have records sorted by date because the field or record containing the
data is set up as a date field the database reached the information in the date field
not just as numbers separated by slashes but rather as dates that must be ordered according
to a calendar system 
Properties of a Table  A table has a name that is distinct from all other tables in
the database  There are no duplicate rows, each row is distinct  Entries in columns are
atomic  The tables does not contain repeating groups or multi valued attributes 
Entries from columns are from the same domain based on their data type including number
that can be numeric, integer or float, smallint, etcetera  Character or string then date, logical,
true or false values  Operations combining different data types are disallowed  Each
for data storage and processing  This model is simple and it has all the properties and
attribute has a distinct name, the sequence of columns is insignificant  The sequence
of rows is insignificant 
Important Terminologies  A relational database stores data in the form of relations or tables 
Consider a relation student with attributes serial number, name, place, phone and age
shown in the following table  In relational data model relations are saved in the format
of tables  This format stores the relation among entities  A table has rows and columns
where rows represents records and columns represent the attributes 
Attribute  Attributes are the properties that define a relation  Example, serial number
or name  Tuple, A single row of a table which contains a single record for that relation
is called a tuple  The above relation contains six tuples, one of which is one zero one,
capabilities required to process data with storage efficiency  The Relational model or
Thomas, Kochi, nine one five six two five three one three one and twenty 
Relations Schema  A Relation Schema represents the logical structure of a relation  It can
be represented by the name of the relation with its attributes  Example, student of serial
number, name, place, phone and age is relation schema for student  A relational schema can
be described an outline of a database that specifies the way data is organized into tables 
Relation Instance  The set of tuples of a relation at a particular instance of time
is called as relation instance  The above table shows the relation instance of student
at a particular time  It can change whenever there is insertion, deletion or updation in
the database  Degree  The number of attributes in the relation is known as degree of the
relation  The student relation defined above has degree five  Cardinality  The number of
R M is first described in nineteen sixty nine by English computer scientist Edgar F  Codd 
tuples in a relation is known as cardinality  The student relation defined above has cardinality six 
Column  Column represents the set of values for a particular attribute, the column serial
number is extracted from relation student  NULL Values  The value which is not known
or unavailable is called NULL value  It is represented by blank space  Example, Phone
of STUDENT having serial number six is NULL  Relation key  Each row has one or more attributes
known as relation key which can identify the row in the relation or table uniquely, example
serial number for student 
Constraints in Relational Model  While designing relational model we define some conditions
which must hold for data present in the database called constraints  These constraints are
checked before performing any operation such as insertion, deletion and updation in databases 
The relational model organizes data into collections of two dimensional tables called relations 
Welcome to the session on Structured Query Language 
which column headings we prefer to see above the result table 
The SELECT CLOSE is the first close and is one of the last closest of the SELECT statement
that the database server evaluates 
The reason for this is that before we can determine what to include in the final result
set we need to know all the possible columns that could be included in the final result
set 
Syntax of SQL SELECT Statement- To create a simple SQL SELECT Statement, you must specify
the column’s name and the table name 
The whole query is called SQL SELECT Statement 
It will look like SELECT DISTINCT Attribute_List FROM table-name WHERE condition, GROUP BY
The steps required to execute SQL commands are handled transparently by the SQL database 
Attributes HAVING condition, ORDER BY Attributes descending 
Table_name is the name of the table from which the information is retrieved 
Attribute_list includes one or more columns from which data is retrieved 
The code within the brackets is optional 
For example, consider the table STUDENT with columns, serial number, name, place, phone
and age 
The values given are one zero one, Thomas, Kochi, nine one five six two five three one
three one with age value twenty and six records are inserted like this 
To select the first name of all the students the query would be like SELECT NAME FROM STUDENT,
output may look like a table with the column heading NAME and the values Thomas, Anu, Sam,
Sometimes SQL is characterized as non procedural because procedural languages generally require
Suresh, Akbar and Ram 
You can also retrieve data from more than one column 
For example, to select name and place of all the students the query will look like SELECT
NAME, comma PLACE FROM STUDENT 
Output will be a table with two column headings, name and place and the values retrieved from
the above specified table 
To fetch all the fields from the table STUDENT we can use SELECT STAR FROM STUDENT, the output
will be a table with all the column headings serial number, name, place, phone and age
with all the value specified in the table 
SQL WHERE Clause- The WHERE Clause is used when you want to retrieve specific information
the details of the operations to be specified, such as opening and closing tables, loading
from a table excluding other irrelevant data 
For example, when you want to see the information about students in class tenth only then you
do need the information about the students in other class 
Retrieving information about all the students would increase the processing time for the
query 
So, SQL offers a feature called WHERE Clause where we can use to restrict the data that
is retrieved 
The condition you provide in the WHERE Clause filters the rows retrieved from the table
and gives you only those rows which you expected to see 
WHERE Clause can be used along with SELECT, DELETE, UPDATE statements 
and searching indexes or flushing buffers and writing data to file systems 
Syntax of SQL WHERE Clause - WHERE within brackets column or expression and comparison
operator value 
Syntax for WHERE Clause with SELECT statement is SELECT column_list FROM table-name WHERE
condition 
Column or expression is the column of a table or an expression, comparison operator is some
operator like equal to, less than, greater than, etcetera 
Value, any user value or a column name for comparison 
SQL Operators- There are two type of operators namely comparison operators and logical operators,
these operators are used mainly in the WHERE Clause having close to filter the data to
be selected 
Therefore, SQL is considered to be designed at a higher conceptual level of operation
Comparison Operators- Comparison operators are used to compare the column data with specific
value in a condition 
Comparison operators are also used along with the SELECT statement to filter data based
on specific conditions 
The table given here describes each comparison operator 
Equal to is for equal to, less than, greater than symbol or exclamation equal to for not
equal to, less than for less than, greater than, greater than or equal to, less than
or equal to, etcetera 
Logical Operators- There are three logical operators namely And, Or, and Not, these operators
compare two conditions at a time to determine whether a row can be selected for the output 
than procedural languages because the lower level logical and physical operations are
When retrieving data using a SELECT statement you can use logical operators in the WHERE
Clause which allows you to combine more than one conditions 
The logical operators and description is given in the table 
Or, for the row to be selected at least one of the conditions must be true 
And, for a row to be selected all the specified conditions must be true 
Not, for a row to be selected the specified condition must be false 
SQL INSERT INTO Statement- The INSERT INTO statement of SQL is used to insert a new row
in a table 
There are two ways of using INSERT INTO statements for inserting rows 
Only values, first method is to specify only the value of data to be inserted without the
in specified and are determined by the SQL engine or server processes that execute it 
column names 
The syntax is INSERT INTO table_name VALUES value one, value two, etcetera upto value n 
Table_name, name of the table, value one, value two, etcetera are the values of the
first column, second column, etcetera for the new record 
Column names and values both, in the second method we will specify both the columns which
we want to fill and their corresponding values as shown here 
Syntax is INSERT INTO table_name column one, column two, etcetera column n VALUES value
one, value two, etcetera Value n, table_name is the name of the table, column one name
of the first column then second column, etcetera, value one, value two, value three etcetera
are the values for first column, second column and up to the final columns for the new record 
SQL Commands 
Query example- If you want to insert a row to the STUDENT table, the query would be like
INSET INTO STUDENT VALUES six, Srinath, Delhi, nine double four five six nine seven five
two then nineteen 
SQL UPDATE Statement- The UPDATE statement in SQL is used to update the data of an existing
table in database, we can update single columns as well as multiple columns using UPDATE statement
as per our requirement 
Basic syntax is UPDATE table_name SET column one equal to value one, column two equal to
value two, etcetera WHERE condition 
Table_name is the name of the table, column one name of the first column, value one new
value for the first column, etcetera, condition is to select the rows for which the values
Most of the actions you need to perform on a database are done with SQL statements 
of columns need to be updated 
Query example- UPDATE STUDENT SET NAME equal to Unknown WHERE AGE equal to twenty 
This query will update two rows, first row and fourth row and the table STUDENT will
now look like one zero one, Unknown, Kochi, nine one five six two five three one three
one, age twenty 
One zero two, Anu, Bangalore, zero eight zero five four three nine seven six two, twenty
one 
One zero three, Sam, Delhi, nine four double five one two three four five one, age twenty
one 
One zero four, the name will be Unknown, place Chennai, phone number nine one nine one nine
SQL commands are instructions coded into SQL statements which are used to communicate with
Structured Query Language or SQL is a standard database language which is used to create,
five four three two one and age twenty 
One zero five, Akbar, Mumbai, nine six five two four three one five four three, twenty
one and the serial number one zero six will be Ram, Kolkata, NULL value and nineteen 
SQL DELETE Statement- The DELETE statement in SQL is used to delete existing records
from a table 
We can delete a single record or multiple records depending on the condition we specify
in the WHERE Clause 
Basic syntax is, DELETE FROM table_name WHERE some_condition, table_name is the name of
the table, some condition are the condition to choose particular record 
We can delete single as well as multiple records depending on the condition we provide in the
the database to perform specific task, work, functions and queries with data 
WHERE Clause 
If we omit the WHERE Clause than all of the records will be deleted and the table will
be empty 
Query example- DELETE FROM STUDENT WHERE NAME equal to Unknown 
This query will delete two rows, first row and the fourth row and the table STUDENT will
now look like one zero two, Anu, Bangalore, zero eight zero five four three nine seven
six two, twenty one 
One zero three, Sam, Delhi, nine four five five one two three four five one, twenty one 
One zero five, Akbar, Mumbai, nine six five two four three one five four three, twenty
one and one zero six Ram, Kolkata, NULL value and nineteen 
SQL commands can be used not only for searching the database but also to perform various other
SQL is structured query language which is a computer language for storing, manipulating
and retrieving that are stored in a relational database 
In this module the basic idea of structured query language is introduced 
This module gives an account of the SQL commands and statements, the module explains various
SQL commands like SELECT, CREATE, UPDATE and DELETE in detail 
Hope you enjoy this session, see you next time, bye 
functions like you can create tables, add data to tables or modify data, dropped the
table, set permissions for users, etcetera 
SQL commands are grouped into four major categories depending on their functionality 
Data Definition Language or DDL- These SQL commands are used for creating, modifying
and dropping the structure of database objects 
The commands are CREATE, ALTER, DROP, RENAME and TRUNCATE 
All DDL commands are auto committed, that means it saves all the changes permanently
in the database 
maintain and retrieve the relational database 
Examples of DDL commands are, CREATE - is used to create the database or its objects
like table, index, function, views, store procedure and triggers 
DROP- is used to delete objects from the database, ALTER- is used to alter the structure of the
database, TRUNCATE- is used to remove all the records from a table including all spaces
allocated for the records are removed 
COMMENT- is used to add comments to the data dictionary 
RENAME- is used to rename an object existing in the database 
Data Manipulation Language or DML- These SQL commands are used to for storing, retrieving,
modifying and deleting data 
These data manipulation language commands are SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE 
It is used for storing and managing data in relational DBMS 
DML commands are not auto committed, it means changes are not permanent to database, they
can be rolled back 
Examples of DML, SELECT- is used to retrieve data from the database 
INSERT- is used to insert data into a table 
UPDATE- is used to update existing data within a table 
DELETE- is used to delete records from a database table 
Transaction Control Language or TCL- These SQL commands are used to for managing changes
affecting the data 
These commands are COMMIT, ROLLBACK and SAVEPOINT 
These commands are to keep a check on other commands and their effect on the database 
SQL was the first commercial language introduced for E F  Codd’s relational model of database 
These commands can <?>annul</?>* changes made by other commands by rolling the data back
to its original state 
It can also make any temporal change permanent 
Examples of TCL commands,
COMMIT- commits a Transaction  ROLLBACK- rollbacks a transaction in case of any error occurs 
SAVEPOINT- sets a savepoint within a transaction 
Data Control Language or DCL- These SQL commands are used for providing security to database
objects, these commands are GRANT and REVOKE 
DCL will grant and take back authority from any database user 
Examples of DCL commands, GRANT- gives users access privileges to database 
Today almost are relational database management systems such as MySql, Oracle, Infomix, Sybase,
REVOKE- withdraw user’s access privileges given by using the GRANT command 
SQL CREATE TABLE Statement- There are two create statements available in SQL, CREATE
DATABASE and CREATE TABLE 
SQL Create Database - The CREATE DATABASE statement is used to create a database, after
creating a database we can create several other database objects like tables, views,
procedures, etcetera into it 
The user should have admin privileges for creating database 
SQL CREATE DATABASE Statement - CREATE DATABASE database_name and COLLATE colliation_name 
In the above query database_name is the name of the database to be created, collation_name
is the default coalition like character set for the database 
MS Access, etcetera use SQL as the standard database query language 
This collation_name is an optional field and if not provided then default collation is
assigned to the database 
CREATE DATABASE example, if you want to create database, My Database with default collation,
the statement would be like CREATE DATABASE MyDatabase terminated with semicolon 
SQL Create Table- We have learned about creating database 
Now, to store the data we need a table to do that 
The Create Table statement is used to create a table in SQL 
We know that a table comprises of rows and columns, so while creating tables we have
to provide all the information to SQL about the names of the columns, type of data to
be stored in columns, size of the data, etcetera 
SQL is used to perform all types of data operations in RDBMS 
Let's now dive into details on how to use Create Table statement to create tables in
SQL 
CREATE TABLE table_name coloumn one data_type within brackets the size, column two data_type,
size, column three database size, etcetera terminated with semicolon 
Table_name is the name of the table, column one name of the first column, data_type is
the type of the data we want to store in the particular column 
For example, int for integer data 
Size, size of the data we can store in a particular column, for example, for a column we specified
the data type as int and size as ten, then this column can store an integer number of
maximum ten digits 
SQL is a declarative language in which the expected result or operation is given without
Example Query- This query will create a table named students with five columns, role number,
name, place, phone and age 
Query will be like CREATE TABLE STUDENT within brackets serial number int of three, NAME
varchar of twenty, PLACE varchar of twenty, PHONE int of ten, AGE two 
SQL SELECT Statement- SELECT is the most commonly used statement in SQL, the SELECT statement
in SQL is used to retrieve or fetch data from a database 
We can fetch either the entire table or according to some specified rules 
The data returned is stored in a result table 
This result table is also called result set, with the select close of a select command
statement we specify the columns that we want to be displayed in the query result and optionally
the specific details about how to accomplish the task 
Welcome back 
LANs are distinguished from other type of networks by their transmission media and topology 
The most common LAN topologies are bus, ring and star 
The speeds of the LANs are normally hundred to thousand Mbps 
Wireless LANs are the newest evolution in LANs technology 
IEEE has defined the specification for a wireless LAN called IEEE eight naught two point one
one which covers the physical and data link layer 
Wide Area Network or WAN- A WAN links machines over a greater distance like neighboring cities
or opposite sides of the world 
WAN provides long distance transmission of data, image, audio and video over large geographical
area such as country, continent or the whole world 
not only audio or video, but every type of information or resources 
A WAN can be simple enough to connect a home computer to the internet or can be as complex
as the backbones that connect the internet, the wireless WAN is getting more popular now 
Metropolitan Area Network or MAN- A MAN is with a size between a LAN and a WAN 
It normally spans a local connectivity like inside a town or a city 
It is designed for high speed connectivity 
An example of MAN is the part of the telephone company network that provides a high speed
DSL line to the customer 
Another common example is the cable TV 
Network that originally was designed for cable TV, but today can also be used for high speed
data connection to the Internet 
Network classifications- A network is a set of devices or nodes connected by communication links 
Today, isolated use of LAN, WAN or MAN is very rare 
Instead, they are connected to one another to form an internetwork or internet 
Network protocols- For a network to do its functions reliably there should be some rules
and regulations to conduct the activities 
Such rules are called protocols 
These protocols standards have its own importance in developing network technologies and communication
with other systems 
Without any rules governing to the communication of different models in a network all may try
to transmit messages at the same time or may fail to relay messages 
When approached use is the token ring protocol developed by IBM in nineteen seventies and
A node can be a computer, printer or any other device capable of sending and or receiving
still using in networks based on ring topology 
In this protocol, all the machines in the network transmit messages in one common direction 
Hence, all the messages will move in the same direction by being forwarded from node to node
When the message reaches its destination, the destination machine keeps a copy of it
and forwards around the ring 
When the forwarded copy reaches the originating computer, that machine knows that the message
must have reached its destination and removes the message from the ring 
To avoid the problem of a single machine transmitting messages of its own constantly, a unique bit
pattern called a token is passed around the ring 
Only the machine which posses the token is allowed to transmit its own messages 
data generated by other nodes on the networks 
Without the token, a machine is only allowed to forward messages 
If the token possessed has multiple messages to transmit after transmitting one message
and when that message completes its cycle, the machine should forward the token to the network 
In this way, each machine in the network has equal opportunity to include messages of its
own as the token goes around the ring 
Another protocol for coordinating message transmission is used in bus topology is based
on Ethernet protocol collection 
The right to transmit messages is controlled by the protocol known as Carrier Sense Multiple
Access with Collision Detection or CSMA by CD 
According to this protocol, each message be broadcasted to all the machines on the bus 
A network must be able to meet a certain number of criteria 
Each machine monitors all and receives only those which are addressed to them 
To transmit message a machine waits until the bus is silent and then transmits, if another
machine also begins transmitting both machines detect the clash or coalition and waits for
certain amounts of time before trying to transmit again 
Combining networks- Sometimes to extend a communication system, existing networks are
connected 
This is done by connecting the networks to form a large version of the same type of networks 
For example, bus networks are connected to form a single large bus 
This is done by the devices known as repeaters, bridges and switches 
The repeater simply passes signals back and forth between the two original buses with
The most important of these are performance, reliability and security 
some amplification without considering the meaning of the signals 
A bridge is more complex than a repeater 
It connects two buses, but does not necessarily pass all messages across the connection 
It looks at the destination address accompanied with each message and forward it only when
the destination is on the other side 
Thus, two machines residing on the same side of the bridge can exchange messages without
interfering the communication on the other side 
A switch is a bridge with multiple connections, allowing it to connect several buses rather
than just two 
As with bridges a switch consider the destination address of all messages and forwards only
Performance- performance can be measured in different ways, including transit time and
those messages <?>the stand</?> for other spokes 
The existence of repeaters, bridges and switches is transparent to the individual computers
in the system 
Sometimes, the network to be connected have incompatible connection characteristics, between
ring with token ring and Ethernet bus with CSMA by CD 
In such cases, the network must be connected in the manner that builds a network of networks
called internet, not the internet 
The connection between two networks to form an internet is handled by a router 
A router is a computer belonging to both networks that forwards messages in one network to another 
The task of router is significantly greater because it should convert from a network using
response time 
one protocol to another network using some other protocol 
The networks are categorized by the roles, the server and the PCs play in terms of hierarchical
and security interaction 
Some networks are server based networks and some other are peer to peer networks 
Server Based Model- Server based networks usually include many nodes and one or more
servers, which control user access to the networks resources 
This central computer is known as the file server, network server,
application server or just server 
Files and programs used by more than one user are often stored on the server 
When a node needs information from the server, it request the file containing the information,
Transit time is the amount of time required for a message to travel from one device to another 
the server stored and forwards the files to nodes that request them 
Users or nodes must log on to the network to gain access to its resources 
An important type of server based network is the client server network where individual
computers share the processing and storage workload with a central server 
Client server networks can be used on LANs or WANs 
The common example of a client server computing is a database that can be accessed by many
computers on the network 
When a user needs to find information in the database the client software sends a query
to the server, which searches the database and returns the information to the user's PC 
Peer to Peer Model- In peer to peer network or P to PN or workgroup all nodes on the network
Response time is the elapsed time between an inquiry and a response 
In this module, we are going to discuss about Computer Networks 
have equal relationships to all others and all have similar type of software that supports
the sharing of resources 
Here, each node has access to at least some of the resources on all other nodes 
Many client operating systems such as Windows nine x, Windows two thousand, Windows ME,
Windows XP and the Macintosh OS have built in support for peer to peer networking 
One of the most desirable characteristics of the peer to peer network is the managed
and controlled access to the shared resources 
Some high end peer to peer networks allow distributed computing 
The internet- Simply stating the internet is a network and a global communication system
that links together several thousands of individual networks 
The performance of a network depends on a number of factors like number of users, type
This enhances the users of any computer on any network to exchange messages, communicate
in real time, share data and programs with any other user on any other network 
The Internet started its journey in nineteen sixty nine when the Advanced Research Projects
Agency or the ARPA of the US Department of Defense began connecting computers at different
universities and defense contractors, the network was called ARPANET 
The Internet acts as a carrier for several different services, each with its own distinct
features and purposes 
The most commonly used internet services are electronic mail, news, file transfer protocol,
chat, instant messaging, online services and peer to peer services 
Security- When a computer is connected to a network, chance for attack and unauthorized
of medium, capabilities of the hardware and efficiency of software 
access are more 
There are numerous ways in which a computer system and the data it can be attacked if
it is connected to any network some malicious software are used for this 
Example for this type of software are, viruses, worms, trojan horses and spyware 
A virus is a software or programming code that replicates by being copying or initiating
its copying to another program, computer boot sector or document 
Viruses can be transmitted as attachments to an email node or in a downloaded file or
be present on a diskette or CD 
Some viruses are playful in intent and some can be quite harmful, erasing data or causing
the hard disk to require reformatting 
Reliability- It is measured by the accuracy of delivery, frequency of failure, time it
It is important to note that a virus cannot be spread without a human action, such as
running an infected program to keep it going 
A worm is similar to a virus by design and is considered to be a type of virus, worm
spread from computer to computer, but unlike a virus, it has the capacity to travel without
any human action 
A worm takes advantage of file or information transport features on the system to travel itself 
The biggest danger with a worm is its capability to replicate itself on the system 
So, rather than a single computer sending out a single worm, it could send out hundreds
or thousands of copies of itself 
A Trojan horse is full of as much trickery as the mythological Trojan horse it was named after 
takes a link to recover from a failure and the networks robustness 
The Trojan horse will actually do damage if it is installed or run on the computer once 
Those on the receiving end of a Trojan horse are usually tricked into opening them because
they appear to be receiving legitimate software or files from a legitimate source 
When a Trojan is activated on the computer, the results can vary 
Some Trojans are designed to be more annoying than malicious like changing the stop or adding
silly active desktop icons or they can cause serious damage by deleting files and destroying
information on the system 
Trojans are also known to create a backdoor on computers that gives malicious user’s
access to the system, possibly allowing confidential or personal information to be compromised 
Unlike viruses and worms, Trojans do not reproduce by infecting other files nor do they self
Security- Network security issues include protection from unauthorized access, damage
replicate 
Another type of malicious software is the spyware that collects information about activities
at the computer on which it resides and reports it to the attacker 
A firewall is used as a primary prevention technique for such attacks 
Spam filters are firewalls to block unwanted email 
Proxy server is used as an intermediary between a client and a server to shield the client
from the actions of a server 
Antivirus softwares are used to detect the presence of non viruses and other infections 
This module provides a base for computer networks, which includes the study of how the various
resources such as hardware, software and information are shared among different computers 
of data, development of new information and implementing policies and procedures for recovery
Here the different types of computer networks based on size and topology are illustrated 
This module covers the topics such as various connectors used in the network and different
communication through the network

According to the physical layout of the network and the number of devices connected network
can be classified into different types 
Based on topology- The term topology refers to the way in which networks are physically
With the advent of computers in every field of life, sharing of resources such as hardware,
connected together 
Topology determines the complexity and therefore the cost of the network cable installation 
It is the geometric representation of the relationship to one another, basic topologies
are bus, ring, star and mesh 
Bus Topology- Here, a single main cable connects each node and each node is connected to two
other, the one long cable act as the backbone to link all the devices in the network 
Nodes are connected to the bus cable by drop lines and tapes 
The drop line is the connection running between the devices and the main cable 
A tape is a connector that either splices into the main cable or punctures the <?>shutting</?>
of a cable to create a contact with the metallic core 
software and information became an emerging need 
The network operating system keeps track of a unique electronic address for each node
and manages the flow of data based on this addressing scheme 
The bus topology is the simplest and most widely used network design 
As a signal travels along the backbone, it becomes weaker and weaker as it travels further
and further 
Hence, there is a limit on the number of tapes a bus can support and on the distance between
those tapes 
Bus topology is easy to install and uses less cabling, but it is difficult for reconnection
and fault isolation 
Adding new devices require modification or replacement of the backbone, as it is usually
The necessity of sharing resources among different computers led to the lined computer system
designed to be optimally efficient at installation 
Bus topology was one of the first topologies used in the early lance 
Ring topology- In ring topology, each device has a dedicated point to point connection
with only the two devices on either side of it 
A signal is passed along the ring in one direction from device to device until it reaches its
destination 
Each device in the ring uses a repeater when a device receives a signal intended for another
device, its repeater regenerates the bits and passes them along 
A ring is easy to install and reconfigure, adding or deleting a device requires changing
only two connections, but it has a maximum ring length and restriction for number of devices 
called networks 
But, unidirectional traffic has the disadvantage that a break in the ring such as a disabled
station can disable the entire network 
This is solved by using a dual ring or a switch that is capable of closing off the break 
Ring networks usually follow a token passing protocol 
Star topology- Each computer on a star topology has a dedicated point to point link with a
central hub that resends the message either to all the computers or in a broadcast star
network or only to the destination computer in the switch to start network 
Of these topologies the star network is perhaps the oldest having evolved from the paradigm
of a large central computer serving many users 
A star topology is less expensive than a mesh topology 
Business today rely on computer networks and internet 
Additions, moves and deletions involve only one connection between that device and the hub 
If one link fails, only that link is affected 
All other links remain active 
This factor makes fault identification and fault isolation an easy task 
The biggest disadvantage of star topology is that the whole topology is dependent on
a single point called hub 
If the hub goes down, the whole system is dead 
In a mesh topology- every device has a dedicated point to point link to every other device 
The term dedicated means that the link carries traffic only between the two devices it connects 
The number of physical links in a fully connected mesh network with n nodes is n into n minus
The development of personal computers brought an ever new change to business, industry,
one divided by two 
A mesh offers several advantages over other network topologies 
The use of dedicated links guarantees that each connection can carry its own data load,
thus eliminating the traffic problems that  can occur when links must be shared by multiple devices 
If one link becomes unusable, it does not affect the entire system 
This type of network has an added advantage of privacy or security 
When every message travels along a dedicated line only the intended recipient sees it 
Physical boundaries prevent other users from gaining access to messages 
The disadvantage of mesh are the amount of cabling and the number of input output ports required 
An example of a mesh topology is the connection of telephone regional offices in which each
science and education 
regional office needs to be connected to every other regional office 
Next, Based on size, the category of a network is generally determined by its size, they
are local area network or LAN- LAN is usually privately owned 
It normally consists of a collection of computers in a single building, office or campus 
For example, the computers on a university campus or those in a manufacturing company
are connected by a LAN 
Depending on the needs of an organization and the type of technology used, a LAN can
be simple like two PCs and a printer or it can be extended to include the entire company
and its audio and video peripherals 
Currently, size of the LAN is limited to a few kilometers 
In the same way, data communication and computer networks open up a very broad way to exchange
Welcome to the session on Guided Transmission Media 
Applications- coaxial cable was widely used in analog telephone networks where a single
coaxial network could carry ten thousand voice signals 
Later it was used in digital telephone networks where a single coaxial cable could carry digital
data up to six hundred mbps 
Cable TV networks also use coaxial cables 
Another common application of coaxial cable is in traditional Ethernet LANs 
Because of its high bandwidth, and consequently high data rate, coaxial cable was chosen for
digital transmission in early Ethernet LANs 
Optical Fiber Cable- an optical fiber or a fiber optics cable is made of glass or plastic
and transmits signals in the form of light 
path 
If a ray of light travels from a denser medium to less dense medium, if the angle of incidence
is less than the critical angle, the ray refracts and moves closer to the surface 
If the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle, the ray reflects and travels
again in the denser medium 
This phenomenon is known as total internal reflection 
Optical Fiber uses reflection to guide light through a channel 
A glass or plastic core is surrounded by a cladding of a less dense glass or plastic 
The difference in density of the two materials should be such that a beam of light moving
through the core is reflected of the cladding instead of being refracted into it 
That is Optical-Fiber work on the principle that the core refracts the light and the cladding
Data signal in guided medium is bound by the cabling system 
reflects the light 
These light pulses which can be carried over long distances through Optical Fiber cable
carry information 
There are three types of transmission modes used by Optical Fibers 
Multimode- multiple beams from a light source move through the core in different paths 
In multimode step index Fiber, density of the core remains constant from the centre
to the edges 
In multimode graded index Fiber, density is highest at the centre of the core and decreases
gradually to its lowest at the edges 
Single Mode- single mode uses step index Fiber and a highly focused source of light that
Hence, guided medium is also known as bound medium 
limits beams to a small range of angles, all close to the horizontal 
The Single Mode Fiber is manufactured with a much smaller diameter than that of Multimode
Fiber and with substantially lower density index of refraction 
The decrease in density results in a critical angle that is close enough to ninety degree
to make the propagation of beams almost horizontal 
In this case, propagation of different beams is almost identical and delays are negligible 
All the beams arrive at the destination together and can be recombined with little distortion
to the signal 
Advantages- With the large bandwidth, they can transmit large volume of data at very
high speed and long distances 
There are three basic type of Guided transmission media such as twisted pair cable, coaxial
Light signals can travel at much higher speed than electrical signals with no significant
loss of intensity over long distance 
Since Optical Fibers are made of glass or plastic they are not affected by magnetic
or electric fields 
Small size and light weight 
It is highly secured and extremely difficult to tap optical signals 
Disadvantages- Installation and maintenance of Optical Fiber is costly since it requires
special equipment and experts 
Being fragile they cannot turn at sharp corners 
Joining two optical fiber cable requires special equipment and hence, it is costly 
cable and Fiber-optic cable 
Fiber Optic Connectors- There are three types of connectors for Fiber optic cables 
The subscriber channel or SC connector is used for cable TV 
It uses a push pull locking system 
The straight-tip or ST connector is used for connecting cable to networking devices 
It uses a bayonet locking system and is more reliable than SC 
MT-RJ is a connector that is same size as RJ forty-five 
Applications- Fiber optic cable is often found in backbone networks because its wide bandwidth
is cost effective 
Today with wave length division multiplexing that is WDM, we can transfer data at a rate
of thousand six hundred gbps 
Twisted pair cable- a twisted pair consists of two conductors each with <?>Easton</?>
Some cable TV companies use a combination of Optical Fiber and Coaxial cable, thus creating
a hybrid network 
Optical Fiber provides the backbone structure while coaxial cable provides the connection
to the user premises 
This is a cost-effective configuration, since the narrow bandwidth requirement at the user
end does not justify the use of Optical Fiber 
Local-area networks such as hundred Base-FX network (Fast Ethernet) and thousand Base-
X, also use Fiber optic cable 
This module gives the details of the commonly used Guided Transmission Media for carrying
information through a network 
plastic insulation twisted together in a helical form to reduce electrical interferences from
Guided media use a cabling system that guide the data signals along a specific path 
Information from one network device to another passes through this medium 
It consists of a cable, composed of metals like copper or tin 
Since, the guided medium is bound by the cabling system, they are also known as bounded medium 
The three-basic types of cables, such as twisted pair, coaxial cable and fiber optic are discussed
here with the features, advantages,
disadvantages and applications  Thanks for watching this session 
See you next time, until then bye 
similar pair close by 
One of the conductors actually carries the data while the others serve as ground reference 
The receiver side uses the difference between the two conductors 
In the field of computer networks, a transmission medium can be considered as anything which
Twisted-pair cables are of two types, UTP and STP 
The most common type of twisted-pair cable used in communication is referred to as unshielded
twisted-pair or UTP 
It is commonly used in telephone system 
The cable has four pairs of wire inside a jacket, normally plastic 
Each pair is twisted with different number of twists per inch to eliminate interferences
from adjacent pairs 
The tighter the twisting, the higher the supported transmission rate and the cost per foot 
Shielded twisted pair or STP cable has a metal foil or braided mesh covering that encases
each pair of insulated conductors 
carries data from a source node to a destination node 
This improves the quality of the cable by preventing the penetration of noise 
But, it is bulkier and more expensive than UTP 
Twisted pairs can run several kilometers without amplification but for longer distance repeaters
are needed 
This type of wires can be used for either analog or digital transmission 
The bandwidth depends on the thickness of the wire and the distance travelled 
Twisted pair cable connectors, the most common UTP connector is RJ forty-five, RJ stands
for registered jack 
The RJ forty-five is a key to connector, meaning, the connector can be inserted in only one way 
Advantages- their performance is adequate, they are inexpensive, easy to install and
Computers and other electronic devices use signals to represent data 
use, and disadvantages- when the line length extends beyond hundred meters, the error rate
is high 
Hence, the length is limited 
Applications of twisted pair cables, twisted pair cables are used in telephone lines to
provide voice and data channels 
The local loop, the line that connects subscribers to the central telephone office, commonly
consists of unshielded twisted pair cables 
They are used in the DSL lines that are used by the telephone companies to provide high-data-rate
connections 
Local-area networks, such as ten Base-T, hundred base-T use twisted pair cables 
These signals are transmitted from one device to another in the form of electro-magnetic
Coaxial cables- coaxial cables are used to carry signals having higher frequency range
than those in twisted pair cables 
Coaxial cables are specially wrapped and insulated wires capable of transmitting data at higher rates 
It consists of a central copper wire, surrounded by a PVC insulation <?>4:24</?> there is sleeve
of copper mesh 
The copper mesh is again shielded by a thick PVC material 
Coaxial cable gets its name because it contains two conductors that are parallel to each other 
The actual data travels through the centre conductor in the cable 
Electromagnetic interference or EMI is caught by the outer copper mesh 
There are different types of coaxial cables vary by gauge and impedance 
energy which is propagated through the transmission medium 
Gauge is the measure of cable thickness 
These are measured by radio grade or sometimes referred to as radio government which is denoted
as RG number 
They can transmit data at the rate of ten mbps 
They are used extensively in long distance telephone lines and cables for cable TV 
They have higher noise immunity 
Coaxial cable standards- coaxial cables are categorized by their radio government or RG ratings
Each RG number denotes a unique set of physical specifications including the wire gauge of
the inner conductor, the thickness and type of the inner insulator, the construction of
the shield and the size and type of the outer casing 
Transmission media can be broadly classified into Guided transmission media and Unguided
Some commonly used types are listed here-
The coaxial type RG four has characteristic impedance fifty point zero, outside diameter
five point seven four, velocity factor point six six and it’s a braid shield material 
RG twenty two has impedance of ninety five, outer diameter ten point seven, velocity factor
point six six and it is also a braid shield 
RG twenty three which has characteristic impedance of one twenty five, outside diameter twenty
four point zero, velocity factor zero point six six and braid shield 
RG twenty-four, also of impedance one twenty-five with outside diameter twenty-five point five,
velocity factor point six six and braid shield 
RG thirty-four with impedance seventy-five, outside diameter sixteen point zero, velocity
transmission media 
factor point six six and braid shield 
RG one zero eight has the characteristic impedance seventy eight, outside diameter six point
zero and it is also braid shield 
RG two one three by U which has the characteristic impedance of fifty and outside diameter ten
point three, velocity factor point six six, which is braid shield, polythene dielectric
material 
RG two one four by U has fifty characteristic impedance, outside diameter is ten point eight,
velocity factor is point six six and double screened braid, silver plated copper wire 
RG two twenty-three by U has the characteristic impedance of fifty, outside diameter five
point five, velocity factor point six six and it is a double screened braid shield material 
This module focuses on Guided transmission media 
Coaxial cable connectors- to connect coaxial cable to devices, we need coaxial connectors 
The most common type of connector used today is the Bayonet-Neil Concelman or BNC connector 
There are three types of BNC connectors- The BNC Connector, used to connect the end of
the cable to a device, such as a TV set 
The BNC-T Connector, used in Ethernet networks to branch out to a connection to a computer
or other device 
The BNC Terminator, used at the end of the cable to prevent the reflection of the signal 
Advantages- highly resistant to signal interference, can support greater cable length between network
devices, very robust 
The disadvantages are, more expensive per foot and difficult to install 
Guided transmission media uses cabling system that guide the data signals along a specific
Welcome to the session on Unguided Transmission Media 
As the satellite is positioned in a geosynchronous orbit, it is stationary relative to earth
and always stays over the same point on the ground 
This is usually done to allow ground stations to aim antenna at a fixed point in the sky 
The communication is carried through uplinks and downlinks 
The uplink transmits the data to the satellite, and downlink receives the data from the satellite 
The area shadowed by the satellite in which the information on data can be transmitted
and received is called the footprint 
Advantages- it is a single microwave relay station visible from any point of long distance 
Transmission and reception cost are independent of the distance between two points 
Capability to receive back its own transmission 
Signals are normally broadcast through the air, and thus are available to anyone who
Disadvantages- Satellite manufacturing is expensive, high cost of placing the satellite
into its orbit 
Necessary security measures are to be taken to prevent unauthorized tampering of information 
Infrared wave transmission- Infrared waves with frequencies from three hundred gigahertz
to four hundred tera hertz can be used to short range communication 
These frequencies are just below the visible light spectrum, infrared waves having high
frequencies cannot penetrate walls 
These advantages characteristic prevents interferences between one system and another a short range
communication system in one room cannot be affected by another system in the next room 
When we use infrared remote control, we do not interfere with the use of the remote by
has the device capable of preceding them 
our neighbors 
However, these same characteristics makes infrared signal useless for long range communication 
In addition, we cannot use infrared waves outside a building, because the sun’s rays
contain infrared waves that can interfere with the communication 
Advantages- The waves are cheap, directional, can easily built 
Disadvantages include, waves do not pass through solid objects 
Applications, the infrared band almost four hundred tera hertz has an excellent potential
for data transmission 
Such a wide bandwidth can be used to transmit digital data with a very high data rate 
The infrared data association IRDA in association for sponsoring the use of infrared waves has
Unguided mediums are used for point to point connections between two devices, while unguided
established standards for using these signals for communication between devices, such as
keyboards, mouse, PCs and printers 
Infrared signals can be used for short range communication in a closed area using line
of sight propagation, this is widely used in TV remotes, garage doors and wireless speakers 
Bluetooth- Bluetooth system is named after a Danish King Harald Blatand, who is known
for his contribution to unification of tribes from Denmark, Norway and Sweden 
The main function of the Bluetooth technology is used to connect various electronic devices
wirelessly to a system for the transferring of data 
Bluetooth is used to create a personal area network of PAN or PIconnect that <?>lets</?>
devices such as cell phones, hands free earphones, mouse, wireless keyboards etcetera to be connected 
medium allow signals to be sent out informally across multiple areas, reaching a wide variety
By using Bluetooth information from one device can be transferred to another device within
a range of ten meters 
It uses radio signals that are omnidirectional and hence the devices need not be aligned
with each other 
This technology has various functions and it is used commonly in the wireless communication
market 
When Bluetooth capable devices come in range of one another, the connections are set automatically 
Once the conversation has occurred, devices form a PIconnect 
Once the PIconnect is established, the member devices randomly hop frequencies in unison 
So, <?>these tend</?> touch with one another and avoid other PIconnects that maybe operating
of systems 
in the same room 
Advantages- Robustness, low complexity, low power requirements 
Bluetooth radio link uses fast acknowledgment and frequency hopping scheme 
Disadvantages- Maximum data transmission rate is one Mbps, not suitable for exchanging large
data files and folders 
Maximum range is thirty feet, hence the space is limited 
Applications- Can be used to create PAN with electronic devices, such as cell phones, PDA,
wireless keyboards etcetera, Can be used to transfer small files from one device to another,
when any other networks are not available 
Wi-Fi- the term Wi-Fi stands for Wireless Fidelity, which is a powerful wireless communication
The most common application of wireless data communication is for mobile users 
that is used by various electronic devices like smart phones, laptops, etcetera 
In this set up a router works as a communication hub wirelessly, these networks allow users
to connect only within close proximity to a router 
Wi-Fi is very common in networking applications, which affords portability wirelessly 
The devices should be equipped with wireless network in the <?>face card</?> that is NIC
to send and receive Wi-Fi signals 
These networks need to be protected with passwords for the purpose of security, otherwise it
will access by others 
Advantages- Allows developing low cost wireless networks 
Elimination of wires enables the devices to move from one location to another within range 
Those include people in car or airplanes, satellites, remote space, <?>props</?> and
Disadvantages- Weak security and vulnerable to attack 
Wi-Fi signals are not confined to the boundaries of building and intruders can easily gain
access to the network 
It is susceptible to interference from other devices operating in the same area such as
wireless phones, other wireless networks etcetera 
Applications- Widely used for creating wireless LANs and to provide wireless internet access 
Development of low cost networks for home and office 
This module describes the important unguided transmission media used in networks 
The data can be transmitted from source to destination with the help of wireless mediums,
such as radio waves, microwaves, satellites, infrared, Bluetooth, etcetera 
space shuttles 
What are the methods used in each techniques, their advantages, disadvantages and applications
are discussed here 
Hope you enjoy this session, see you next time, until then bye 
The unbounded or unguided media are not using any physical connectors between the two devices
communicating usually the transmission is sent through the atmosphere 
We already know that a transmission medium can be considered as anything, which carries
Wireless media are used when a physical obstruction or distance blocks are used with normal cable media 
Some commonly used unguided media for transmission include radio frequency propagation, microwave
transition, satellite transmission, infrared wave transmission, Bluetooth and WI-Fi 
Radio Frequency or RF propagation- in radio frequency propagation, the signal is carried
over waves, which have frequencies in the range of radio frequency spectrum 
Mostly an audio broadcasting service, radio broadcast sound through the air as radio waves 
Radio uses a transmitter which is used to transmit the data in the form of radio waves
to a receiving antenna 
To broadcast common programming, stations are associated with the radio networks, radio
broadcasting maybe done with the cable FM, the net and satellites 
data from a source node to a destination node 
A broadcast sends information over long distances at up to two mega bits per second, example
AM, FM radio 
Radio waves are electromagnetic signals that are transmitted by an antenna 
These waves have completely different frequency segments, and you will be ready to obtain
an audio signal by changing into a frequency segment 
There are three types of <?>3-18</?> propagation, such as ground wave, ionospheric and line of sight 
Ground wave propagation follows the curvature of the earth, they have carrier frequencies
of up to two megahertz 
AM radio is an example of ground wave propagation 
In ionospheric propagation, the signal wave bounces of the earth’s ionosphere layer
The data signals represented by computers and other electronic devices are transmitted
in the upper atmosphere 
It operates in the frequency range of thirty to eighty five megahertz 
As this type of propagation depends on the earth’s ionosphere, it changes with the
day timings and weather 
Line of sight propagation transmits exactly in the line of sight, the receiving station
must be in view of the transmitting station 
It is sometimes called space waves or tropospheric propagation 
It is limited by the curvature of the earth for ground based stations 
Generally, radio waves are omnidirection which means that they can travel in all directions
from the sources, so that all transmitter and receiver need not be carefully aligned physically 
from one device to another in the form of electromagnetic energy, which is propagated
Advantages- At low frequencies, radio waves pass through obstacles well 
At high frequencies, radio waves tend to travel in straight lines and bounces off obstacles 
Disadvantages- Due to radio’s ability to travel long distances, interferences between
users is a problem 
Applications- The omnidirectional characteristics of radio waves make them useful
for multicasting, in which there is one sender but many receivers 
AM and FM radio, television, maritime radio, cordless phones, and paging are examples of
multicasting 
Microwave transmission- Electromagnetic waves having frequencies between one to three hundred
gigahertz are called microwaves, microwaves are unidirectional 
through the transmission medium 
When an antenna transmits microwaves, they can be narrowly focused 
Microwave transmission use microwave signals that travel a higher frequency, and are popularly
used for transmitting data over long distances 
Microwave communication uses parabolic antennas that are mounted on the tower, which could
be some kilometers away, but in line of sight 
Due to the long distance repeaters are used at regular intervals in between the transmitter
and the receiver to boost the signals 
Microwave communication makes use of lower gigahertz frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum 
These frequencies are higher than radio frequencies and produce better throughput and performance 
The directional parabolic antennas are used to send and receive signals in lower gigahertz
The two categories of transmission media are guided transmission media and unguided transmission media 
range, these waves cannot bend or pass through obstacles 
Two types of antennas are used for microwave communications, parabolic dish and horn 
A parabolic antenna works as a funnel, catching a wide range of waves and directing them to
a common point, in this way more of the signal is recovered than would be possible with a
single point receiver 
A horn antenna looks like a gigantic scoop, outgoing transmissions are broadcast of a
system and deflected outward in a series of narrow parallel beams by the curved head 
Received transmissions are collected by the scooped shape of the horn in the manner similar
to the parabolic dish, and are deflected down into the system 
Advantages- Suitable for long distance telephone communication, TV, etcetera 
This module gives an overview of unguided or wireless transmission media 
Permits data transmission rate of about sixteen Giga bits per second 
It can carry thousands of voice signals at the same time 
Disadvantages- Microwave towers can exchange data only if they have a clear line of sight
between them with no obstacles, such as buildings, slopes of trees in the way 
Signal absorption by the atmosphere 
Possibility of weather obstruction, cost is high to install 
Applications- Microwaves, due to their unidirectional properties are very useful, when unicast,
that is one-to-one communication is needed between the sender and the receiver 
They are used in cellular phones, satellite networks and wireless LANs 
Satellite transmission- Satellite transmission is done with the help of some artificial satellite
Unlike the guided transmission media which uses caballing system, unguided media are wireless 
used for communication 
It creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different
locations on earth 
Communication satellites are used for television, telephone, radio, internet and military applications 
There are over two thousand communication satellites in earth’s orbit used by both
private and government organizations 
The microwave relay station is placed in outer space, the satellites are launched either
by rockets or space shuttles carry them 
These are positioned thirty six thousand kilometers above the equator, with an orbit speed that
exactly matches the rotation speed of the earth 
It simply transports electromagnetic waves without using any physical conductor 
Welcome
content and facts 
We often suffer from an overdose of data or too often the problems is that the knowledge
available is insufficient or poorly specified 
The challenge here is to get hold of the information that is around and turn it into knowledge
by making it usable 
This might involve for instance making tacit knowledge explicit, identifying gaps in the
knowledge already held, acquiring and integrating knowledge from multiple sources 
Example, different experts or distributed sources on the WWW and acquiring knowledge
from unstructured media 
Applications of internet- Internet acts as a backbone for a variety of useful services,
No one actually owns the internet and no single person or organization controls the internet
important among them are explained here 
They are E-mail, World Wide Web, interest telephony, internet relay chat, Usenet newsgroups,
telnet and FTP, etcetera 
E-mail- Electronic mail or E-mail is the most well known and widely used internet service 
It is a method of exchanging digital messages from another to one or more recipients through
a computer network 
Electronic mails enable internet users to send messages to other users, regardless of
the system they are using or their location in the world 
Internet based E-mails are also known as web mails, to send and receive E-mails one must
have an E-mail address 
in its <?>entity</?> 
E-mail systems allow to attach any format of data, such as text files, image files,
audio files, video files, program files, etcetera along with an email 
World Wide Web or WWW- World Wide Web refers to the huge collection of information stored
in a number of computers around the world, which are connected over internet 
Information in the World Wide Web is represented in hypertext format 
A hypertext document may contain text, images, animations, sound, video, etcetera, embedded
into a single page 
It may also contain text which act as links to another document or to a different section
of the same document 
The hypertext documents which are the part of WWW are stored on computers known as web servers 
The internet is more of a concept rather than an actual tangible entity, and it relies on
Internet users can access the information contained in the WWW using special application
softwares known as web browsers 
Internet telephony- Internet telephony refers to the communication services that help the
internet users to speak to each other over internet 
Internet telephone system allows users to communicate either from computer to computer
or from computer to telephone 
It provides a cheap and easy to use alternative to the conventional telephone systems 
Internet relay chat- Internet relay chat is a common internet service in which participants
around the world can communicate to each other, by typing real time text messages 
Usually, a chat server provides many chat rooms with different chat topics or interest 
a physical infrastructure that connects networks to other networks 
A user can join a chat room of his own interest or even he can start a private chat with a
particular user 
Video chatting is relatively a development which allows users to chat over internet with
the help of a web camera 
Usenet Newsgroups- Usenet newsgroups are world wide text based electronic bulletin board
system, in which millions of internet users exchange information on a variety of topics 
Usenet messages are stored on Usenet servers and the user has to log on to these servers
to access the information 
Telnet and FTP- Telnet is a protocol that allows to log on to a remote computer on the internet 
Telnet helps a local computer to establish connection to a remote host computer and access
The internet has greatly changed the way people use computers and communicate today 
its resources 
FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, it is a protocol used to transfer files between
computers on the internet 
It allows internet users to transfer files from remote servers to their personal computers 
Internet Service Providers- An Internet Service Provider also known as an ISP or even as an
IAP, Internet access provider is a firm that offers subscribers access to the Internet 
This internet service provider maintains large runs of caballing and maintains network services
in order to transfer and deliver web content to those paying the subscription fee 
Typically, these internet service providers focus on DSL, cable modem, wireless and more
recently dedicated high speed interconnects, such as T one or fiber optic service, typically
Many internet terms have become part of people’s everyday language, and email has added a whole
abbreviated FIOS 
While far less common ISP’s still offer dial-up internet service, which is gradually
became a phase out 
All in all there are many different types of internet service providers and within each
every internet service provider there are often varying levels of services, coverage
as well as personal customer service, that comes attached with it 
An internet service provider is a complete package of services, which should be researched
and considered before an internet service provider is selected 
Troubleshooting and internet connection- Troubleshooting is a technical name given to identifying and
correcting problems in electronic equipments 
new means through which people can communicate 
An internet connection is always suspected to problems and it need lot of checks to correct
the errors 
Troubleshooting an internet connection is easy if you know the regular problems faced
in the connection 
Making sure you have correct IP information- make sure you have the correct IP scheme for
your network 
This will include the IP address, Subnet mask, default gateway and DNS servers 
There are a few ways you can see what IP addresses are being assigned, but generally for Windows
nine x, Windows two thousand and Windows seven run the command, ip config slash all from
the command prompt 
The internet is a worldwide collection of networked computers, which are able to exchange
If you have a router common examples would be one ninety two point one sixty eight point
zero point x, one ninety two point one sixty eight point one point x, or ten point zero
point zero point x 
Also make sure you have the correct Subnet mask and default gateway IP address 
With a router this is typically the IP address of your router 
Make sure you have the correct DNS servers 
Possible causes for not getting an IP address assigned are Defective cable, network card
or port on the router, make sure you are using all known working components 
Your router is not configured for DHCP which would automatically be assigning IP addresses,
but you need to have this working before proceeding 
information with one another very quickly 
Basic ping text both by IP address and name, example ping one ninety two point one sixty
eight point one point one 
If you get a reply then your connection to the router is working 
If you don’t get a reply, then you need to double check your network card, cable,
port on the router 
Try pinging an external site by IP address 
Example, ping four point two point two point one 
If you get a reply then you have a connection to the internet 
If you don’t get a reply there are several things you can try 
Double check that the router is connecting to the Internet typically you can access the
The internet in simple terms is a network of the interlinked computer networking worldwide,
to the session on Internet and Applications 
router through your web browser and check its status 
Take the power off your DSL Cable modem and Router 
Plug the modem back in a wait a minute or so 
Plug the router back in and wait a minute or so 
Then restart your computer 
Try pinging an external site by Name, example ping www dot yahoo dot com 
If you get a reply then you have a connection to the internet and DNS is working 
If you don't get a reply, there are several things you can try 
Double check your DNS entries 
You many need to use the same DNS IP address that your ISP or router is using 
which is accessible to the general public 
On rare occasions your ISP has problems with their DNS servers 
But, that is rare in comparison to mis-configured computers 
If your ping test works, but you are having problems browsing sites on the internet 
If you could ping external sites by both IP address and name, but cannot browse the web,
likely your web browser is mis-configured 
Double check that you don’t have an incorrect or not needed proxy server assigned 
For the internet explorer, tools slash internet options slash connections tab LAN settings button 
Uncheck both automatically detect settings and use a proxy server for your LAN 
Introduction to World Wide Web- The World Wide Web is a system that makes exchange of
data on the internet easy and efficient 
Internet is a huge network of several different interlinked networks relating to business,
It consists of two basic components, The Web Server- a computer and software that stores
and distributes data to other computers throughout the internet and request the information 
The Web Browser- software running on an individual's or client computer that request information
from the Web server, and displays it in a manner of directed in the data file itself 
WWW was introduced in nineteen eighty nine, it is the most popular and promising method
of accessing internet 
It’s a huge repository of information stored on various web servers in hypertext format 
An effectively designed hypertext document can help users rapidly locate the desired
type of information, from the vast amount of information on the web 
Hypertext documents enable this by using a series of links 
government, academics and even smaller domestic networks 
A link is an item in a hypertext document which connects the document with another document
that provides more detailed information 
Hypertext documents on internet which is also known as web pages may integrate different
types of information, such as text, image, sound, video etcetera into a single page 
Special languages known as markup languages are used to create hypertext documents 
HTML is the most popular and widely used markup language 
Web servers- Web servers are computers and software’s that stores and distributes data
to other computers throughout the internet, that requires the information 
Web servers are responsible for accepting http request from web clients, which are known
as web browsers, and serving them http responses along with optional data contents, which usually
These networks enable the internet to be used for various important functions which include
are web pages such as html documents and linked objects 
Although web servers programs differ in detail, they shall share some basic common features 
HTTP- Every web server program operates by accepting http request from the client and
providing an http response to the client 
The http response usually consists of an html document, but can also be a raw file, an image
or some other type of document 
If some error is found in client request or while trying to serve it, a web server has
to send an error response, which may include some custom html or text messages to better
explain the problems 
Logging- Usually web servers have also the capability of logging some detailed information
several means of communications like the file transfer, online chat, sharing of the documents,
about client request and server responses to log files 
This allows the web master to collect statistics by running log analyzes on logged files 
Authentication- Optional authentication request, request of user name and password before allowing
access to resources 
Content compression- To reduce the size of the responses 
Bandwidth throttling- To limit the speed of responses in order to not saturate the network
and to be able to serve more clients 
Web browsers- A web browser is a software application for retrieving, presenting, and
traversing information resources on the World Wide Web 
It acts as an interface between the user and the inner details of web 
etcetera 
Web browsers are also known as web clients 
The main functions of web browsers are contact a web server and send a request for information 
Receive the information and display it in a user convenient manner 
Although browsers are primarily intended to use the World Wide Web, they can also be used
to access information provided by web servers in private networks or files in file systems 
The major web browsers are Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Opera and Safari 
The first web browser was invented in nineteen ninety by Sir Tim Berners-Lee 
It was called World Wide Web and was later renamed as Nexus 
The primary purpose of a web browser is to bring information resources to the user, allow
them to view the information and then access other information 
History of internet- The internet was the first result of some machinery thinking by
This process begins with the user inputs a uniform resource locator or URL 
For example, www dot university of calicut dot info into the browser 
On receiving the URL, the browser locates the desired web server, transfers its content
to the local computer, and display it on the local computer screen 
Internet Protocols- Internet protocols are a set of methods or roles that govern the
data transfer between computers on internet 
It is the set of technical specifications that enable computers to exchange information,
irrespective of their hardware and software architectures 
The most commonly used internet protocols are Transmission Control Protocol, Internet
Protocol that is TCP IP 
people in the early nineteen sixties, which show great potential value in allowing computers
File Transfer Protocol FTP, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol HTTP and Telnet 
The internet is based on TCP IP protocols, it is the collection of protocols that govern
the way data travels from one system to another across the internet 
FTP is a protocol that enables the exchange of files between computers on internet, it
works on client server principle 
HTTP is a set of rules that governs the transfer of hyper text data between two or more computers 
It enable the user to receive a wide variety of resources, such as text, sound, pictures,
etcetera 
Telnet is a protocol that enables a computer to log on to a remote server 
It helps a local computer to establish connection to a remote host computer and access its resources 
to share information on research and development in scientific and military fields 
Internet Protocol Address or IP Address- Internet Protocol Address or IP Address is a unique
number used to identify each host computers connected to the Internet 
There are currently two versions of internet protocol IP, IPv four and a new version called
IPv six, IPv six is an evolutionary upgrade to the internet protocol 
IPv six will co-exist with the other IPv four for some time 
An IP version four address consists of four sections separated by dots 
to two fifty five 
IP address represents both a computer and the network to which the computer is connected 
Which sections of the IP address represent the network and which section represents the
<?>2-47</?> of MIT first proposed a global network of computers in nineteen sixty two 
The internet is a massive network of networks or rather a networking infrastructure 
machine, will depend on the class of IP address assigned to the network 
IP addresses are divided into five classes, namely class A, B, C, D and class E 
Class A IP addresses have the first octet value with in the range one to one twenty
seven, that is one point the three octets to one twenty seven point the three octets 
These IP addresses are generally assigned to major service providers 
Class B IP addresses have the first octet value with in the range of one twenty eight
to one ninety one 
Organizations with very large networks such as large business firms, universities, etcetera
are assigned with class B IP addresses 
The first two octets in a class B address describe the network and the remaining two
And moved over to the defense advanced research project agency that is the DARPA in late nineteen
represent the host computer 
Class C IP addresses have the first octet value with in the range one ninety two to
two twenty three 
Here the first three octets represents the network and the remaining one determines the
host machine 
Class C IP addresses are generally assigned to small networks 
There are over one million class C networks with a capacity of two fifty four hosts per network 
Class D IP addresses will have the first octet value in between two twenty four to two thirty
nine, these addresses are reserved for multicasting 
Class E addresses with first octet value in between two forty to two forty seven are reserved
sixty two to head the work develop it 
for future use 
Domain name systems- All computers on internet are assigned with a unique identification
number known as IP address 
Theoretically, if we want to access a website, we have to know and type the corresponding
web servers IP address in the browser 
But, it will be very difficult to remember the IP address as they are strings of numbers 
To solve this issue, each web servers are designed with unique names known as domain
name 
A domain name is simply a string which acts as a substitute to IP address 
Domain names consists of a series of words separated by dots 
Leonard Klein rock of MIT and later UCLA developed the theory of packet switching, which was
The last part of domain name is called Top Level Domain and represent the type of organization
holding the name 
Major categories of top level domains are com for Commercial organizations, also used
by noncommercial organizations such as individuals, government agencies, etcetera 
Dot gov for government organizations and agencies, dot edu for educational institutions and organizations 
Dot org for non-commercial organizations and dot mil for military networks 
Even though domain name makes it easy for the internet users to identify and locate
desired servers 
The internet still use the IP addresses to send and receive data 
So, there must be some mechanism to translate domain names into IP addresses 
to form the basis of internet connections 
A server known as domain name system DNS servers this purpose 
URI and URL- Universal Resource Identifier (URI) is an identifier, which locates a resource
on the World Wide Web 
It includes a URI scheme, authority, path, query and fragment syntax 
A URI identifies a resource either by location or a name or both 
The term Uniform Resource Locator or URL refers to the subset of URIs that, in addition to
identifying a resource, provides a means of locating the resource by describing its primary
access mechanisms, example, its network location 
The URL defines how the resource can be obtained 
We use URL’s everyday in the form of HTTP colon double slash university of Calicut dot
Lauren Streubert of MIT connected a Massachusetts computer with a California computer in nineteen
info, etcetera 
But a URL doesn’t have to be an HTTP URL, it can be FTP double slash university of Calicut
dot info 
A URI is an identifier for some resource, but a URL gives you specific information as
to obtain that resource 
Generally if the URL describes both the location and name of a resource, the term to use is
URI 
The client server model- the term client server refers to a popular model for computer networking
that utilizes client and server devices, each designed for specific purposes 
The client server model can be used on the internet as well as local area networks LANs 
sixty five over dial up telephone lines 
Examples of client server systems on the internet include web browsers and web servers 
FTP clients and servers and the DNS 
The client server model distinguishes between applications as well as devices 
Network clients make request to a server by sending messages, and servers respond to their
clients by acting on each request and returning results 
One server generally supports numerous clients and multiple servers can be networked together
in a poll, to handle the increased processing load as the number of clients grows 
A client computer and a server computer are usually two separate devices, each customized
for their designed purposes 
For example, a web client works best with a large screen display, while a web server
It showed the feasibility of wide area networking, but also showed that the telephone lines circuit
does not need any display at all, and can be located anywhere in the world 
However, in some cases a given device can function both as a client and a server for
the same application 
Likewise, a device that is a server for one application can simultaneously act as a client
to other servers for different applications 
Some of the most popular applications on the internet follow the client server model including
email, FTP and web services 
Each of these clients features a user interface either graphic or text based, and a client
application that allows the user to connect to servers 
In the case of email and FTP, users enter a computer name or sometimes an IP address
switching was adequate and hence <?>3-37</?> packet switching theory was confirmed 
into the interface to set up connections to the server 
Email and Email Protocols- Electronic mail or Email is the most well known and widely
used internet service 
It’s a method of exchanging digital messages from another to one or more recipients through
a computer network 
Basically a protocol is a standard method used at each end of a communication channel 
In order to properly transmit information in order to deal with email, you must use
a mail client to access a mail server 
The mail client and mail server can exchange information with each other using a variety
of protocols 
Roberts moved over to DARPA in nineteen sixty six and developed his plan for ARPANET 
Important among them are listed here, IMAP Protocol- IMAP or Internet Message Access
Protocol is a standard protocol for accessing email from your local server 
IMAP is a client server protocol in which email is received and held for you by your
internet server 
As this requires only a small data transfer this works well even over a slow connection,
such as a modem 
Only if you requested to read a specific email message, will it be downloaded from the serve 
You can also create a manipulate folders or mail boxes on the server, delete messages,
etcetera 
IMAP is the newer protocol and oriented toward a connected mode of operation 
The internet then known as ARPANET was brought online in nineteen sixty nine under a contract
It connects millions of computers together globally forming a network in which any computer
The standard IMAP procedure is to leave messages on the server instead of retrieving copies,
so email is only accessible when online 
IMAP is most suited to a world of always on connections, particularly the fast connections
offered by broadband mechanism 
POP three Protocol- The POP or Post Office Protocol three provides a simple standardized
way for users to access mail boxes and download messages to their computers 
When using the POP protocol, all your email messages will be downloaded from the mail
server to your local computer 
You can choose to leave copies of your emails on the server as well 
The advantage is that once your messages are downloaded, you can cut the internal connections
laid by the advanced research project agency, which initially connected four major computers
and read your email at your leisure without incurring further communication cost 
SMTP protocol- The SMTP or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is used by the Mail Transfer Agent
or MTA to deliver emails to the recipient's mail server 
The SMTP protocol can only be used to send emails not to receive them 
Depending on the <?>network wise</?> settings, you may only be able to use the SMTP protocol
under certain conditions 
Search engines- A search engine is the software program or script available through the internet,
that searches documents and files for keywords and returns the results of any files containing
those keywords 
Today there are many different search engines available on the internet, each with there
at universities in the South Western US 
own abilities and features 
The first search engine ever developed is considered Archie, which was used to search
for FTP files and the first text based search engineers considered <?>Baronica</?> 
The search results are generally presented in a line of research often referred to as
search engine result pages SERPs 
The information maybe a present in web pages, images, information and other type of files 
One can search the internet for any kind of information with the help of search engine 
On the internet a search engine is a coordinated set of programs that include, A spider also
called a "crawler" or a "bot" that explores the internet by following hyperlinks, starting
with a core group of "seed" URLs covering major hubs 
UCLA, Stanford research institute, UCSB and the University of Utah 
Or a program that creates a huge index or database from the pages that have been read 
A program that receives your search request, compares it to the entries in the index, and
returns results to you 
Google is the most widely used search engine in the world capturing about ninety two percentage
of search user’s world wide 
Yahoo and Bing came in second at just over two percentage each 
DuckDuckgo has gained some popularity due to their focused on protecting users private
search data 
Other popular search engines in the world are Baidu for China, Yandex in Russia and
Naver South Korea 
By nineteen seventy one many more new notes were added to this network 
Different search engine approaches- Major search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo
index the content of a large portion of the Web and allow users to query their index to
find relevant pages 
Specialized content search engines may be more selective about what part of the Web
is crawled and indexed 
Country specific search engines may prioritize in-language websites over English websites 
Individual Web sites, especially larger corporate sites, may use a search engine to index and
retrieve the content of just their own site 
Some of the major search engines companies licensed or sell their search engines for
use on individual sites 
The early internet was used by computer experts, engineers, scientists and librarians 
We started with the introduction to internet, which is a network of networks 
The internet has started as ARPANET and later grown up into a global network 
Then we discussed some of the important applications of internet and the internet service providers 
The World Wide Web which is a repository of web information, the different types of protocols
used for internet and search engines were all also discussed 
Hope you enjoy this session, see you next time, bye 
E-mail was adapted for ARPANET by Ray Tomlinson of BBN in nineteen seventy two, he picked
the “at the rate” symbol to link the user name and address 
The ARPANET computers were switched over to TCP IP in nineteen eighty three 
In nineteen eighty six the national science foundation funded NSFN net as across country
fifty six Kbps <?>backboned</?> for the internet 
can communicate with any other computer as long as they are both connected to the internet 
They maintained their sponsorship for nearly a decade setting rules for its not commercial
government and research uses 
By nineteen eighty seven, there were nearly thirty thousand host on the internet 
The original ARPANET protocol had been limited to thousand host, but the adoption of TCP
IP standard made large number of host possible 
In nineteen eighty nine another significant event took place in making the nets easier to use 
Tim Berners-Lee and others at the European laboratory of particle physics proposed a
new protocol for information distribution 
This protocol which became the World Wide Web in nineteen ninety one was based on hyper
text, a system of embodying links in text to link to other text 
Unlike online services which are centrally controlled, the internet is decentralized
Since the internet was initially funded by the government, it was originally limited
to research, education and government uses 
Commercial uses were prohibited unless they directly serve the goals of research and education 
This policy continued until the early nineties when independent commercial networks began to grow 
It then became possible to road traffic across the country from one commercial site to another
without passing through the government funded NSFNET, internet backbone 
Nineteen ninety brought about the first commercial dial-up internet provider, same year ARPANET
cease to exist 
Nineteen ninety five is often consider the first year the web became commercialized 
Since then the internet has undergone several technological evolution that made it easily
by design 
accessible from any part of the world 
Nowadays we can use internet for a variety of purposes 
Internet as a Global Network- the internet has become one of the most loved and used
sources of information 
The World Wide Web’s popularity is phenomenal, websites and web pages are a way of allowing
us all to share our knowledge, interest and experiences 
The benefits of usage of internet are to find things, whether looking for a local taxi company,
a mobile, hair dresser or even some income protection insurance, the internet is a vast
source of knowledge 
We are all guilty of running to the mercy of Google, whenever we want to get our hands
Each internet computer called a host is independent, its operators can choose which internet services to use 
on some information first 
The internet allows us to have information right at our finger tips whenever we need it 
Downfalls of using the internet to gain knowledge- Despite reason tabloid debates regarding privacy
and what you can and cannot say on the internet, the truth still remains that the web offers
a place for freedom of speech 
Because of this freedom to express and share knowledge, you will find many inaccuracies
when relaying on the internet for information and knowledge 
This can be a big problem if you are using the information, you find for college course
work or even to report back to your <?>boos</?> 
Sudden sites like Wikipedia back up their information with facts and evidence, they
And which local services to make available to the global internet community 
even have the facility for reader input and modifications, if a reader feels the content
is inaccurate 
But, sites such as these are very rare, and it is up to our own research skills and common
sense to distinguish between the fact and the fiction 
How to use the internet correctly when looking for information- As the information on the
internet has been put there by us imperfect humans, you need to ensure you only use the
information you are presented with as a guide 
For example, if you are looking for legal information on equity release, use various
sites to gain an overall understanding of the subject 
By consulting many different websites, you will be able to <?>ion</?> out any contradictory
Remarkably this anarchy by design works exceedingly well 
﻿Hello, welcome to the  session on “Online Education”   
simultaneous and two-way communication  This is commonly supported by media such as  
video conferencing, virtual classrooms and  chat sessions  The most familiar form of  
synchronous electronic communication is  real time two-way text-based online chat,  
which is widely used in e-learning  More  sophisticated forms of synchronous instruction  
include virtual classrooms, which use information  and communication technologies to mimic a  
traditional classroom environment  This may  involve video conferencing or the use of shared  
electronic white boards, which allow learning  materials to be created and modified in real time,  
either by the instructor or the learners  Learners and teachers experience synchronous  
e-learning as more social and avoid frustration,  by asking and answering questions in real time   
Synchronous sessions help e-learners feel  like participants rather than isolates   
in the way people learned  The future of education  in general and college education particular  
Asynchronous E-learning- As you are familiar  with the use of email which is also a two-way  
communication  Here the flexibility is that the  sender and receiver of the message need not be  
online at the same time  You can check your email  at your convenient time, thus asynchronous means  
you need not be online at the same time  This  asynchronous e-learning is commonly facilitated  
by media, such as email and discussion boards  Supports work relation among learners and the  
teachers, even when participants cannot be online  at the same time, it is thus a key component of  
flexible learning  Asynchronous instruction allows  participants to control their timetables and fit  
learning around their other commitments, this is  a major bonus especially for adult learners    
Asynchronous e-learning makes it possible for  learners to log on to an e-learning environment at  
any time, and download documents or  send messages to teachers or peers   
will be of more access, more educational  choices and new fields in educational research   
Students may spend more time refining  their contributions which are generally  
considered more thoughtful compared  to synchronous communication   
Many of the technologies used  in asynchronous e-learning,  
also permit two-way communication between  learners and instructors, or multi-directional  
collaborative communication among learners  themselves  Blended learning- In blended learning,  
e-learning is being combined with traditional  classroom methods, and independent study to create  
a new hybrid teaching methodology   Many use terms like hybrid, mixed  
or integrative to describe the same trend   In a blended learning course for example,  
students might attend a class taught by a  teacher in a traditional classroom setting,  
while also independently completing online  components of the course outside the classroom   
Online education is synchronous if the teacher and  student have some direct simultaneous contact   
In this case in class time maybe either replaced  or supplemented by online learning experiences   
And students would learn about the same topics  online as they do in class, that is the online and  
in-person learning experiences, would parallel  and complement one another  The blended learning  
will have the essential requirement of In-person  classroom activities facilitated by a teacher    
Online learning materials provided through a  website, bog, or LMS  Structured independent study  
and assignments both face-to-face and online mode   Blended learning can provide the convenient speed  
and cost effectiveness of e-learning with the  personal touch of traditional learning   
Students can prepare for consolidate and recall  classroom experiences online, while gaining the  
benefits of interaction with teachers and  students via an actual or virtual classroom   
Student learning and retention rates  improve without sacrificing the convenience,  
For instance, a teacher might meet with  students in a chat forum for a discussion   
cost effectiveness and customization  of self-paced, web-based coursework   
Individual versus Group- Individualized e-learning  refers to situations, where an individual learner  
is accessing learning resources, such  as a database or course content offline  
or online via an intranet or internet  A typical example of this is a learner  
studying alone or conducting some research on the  internet, local network, or using a CD or DVD  In  
group based e-learning refers to situations, where  groups of learners are working together in real  
time or with time delay via an intranet or the  internet  It may include text-based conferencing,  
online discussion forum, electronic mailing,  and one or two-way audio and video conferencing   
Examples of this include learners engaged in a  real-time chat or an audio video conference   
Self-paced versus Instructor Lead- In self-paced  approach the e-learning courseware is usually  
Another example of synchronous distance  learning is a teacher delivering a lecture  
made available through an online learning  platform or on CD-ROM  Learners are free to  
choose the learning activities, and learn at  their own pace based on individual needs and  
interests  E-learning content is developed  according to a set of learning objectives,  
and is delivered using different media elements  such as text, graphics, audio and video  It must  
provide as much learning support is possible  through explanations, examples, interactivity,  
feedback, <?>glossaries</?>* etcetera, in  order to make learners self sufficient   
Whereas in instructor lead the course is scheduled  and led by an instructor and or facilitator  
through an online learning platform  E-learning  content for individual study can be integrated  
with instructors, lectures, individual assignments  and collaborative activities among learners   
Learners, facilitators and instructors can  use communication tools such as emails,  
at a scheduled time, with students watch it  simultaneously  Distance learning also allows  
discussion forums, chats, polls, whiteboards  and application sharing and audio and video  
conferencing to communicate and work together  At the end a final step typically includes an  
exercise or assessment to measure learning   Communication Tools- As you are aware  
modern technology provides us with a plethora  of options for communicating  The most common  
communication tool used in e-learning include  email, instant messaging and blogging  Email-  
Email stands for electronic mail, email is defined  as a transmission of messages over communication  
networks  There are many email service providers  and the most famous ones are Yahoo mail and Gmail   
Exchanging mail messages with a mentor  or peer is an e-learning experience   
Instant Messaging IM- Instant messaging is the  exchange of text messages through a software  
application in real time  Instant messaging  allows learners to chat with one another  
for asynchronous learning, where instructor  and learner do not meet in time or space    
through text messages  This has become very  popular as here everything is performed in a  
faster more reliable and cohesive manner   Instant messaging helps teachers to create  
subject specific groups for exchange of  information and sharing of resources   
Instant messaging applications like Whatsapp  are extensively used by teaching community  
as reliable communication tool  Chat- Chat is synchronous communication tool  
facilitating online communication  This tool helps  teachers and learners to schedule a discussion  
on a particular question or theme, and later  save the chat discussion for later use   
The chat tool is an integrated tool in all the LMS  and there are many standalone chat applications  
update on an ongoing basis  A blog is a frequently  updated online personal journal or diary  
For instance, a student may go to a website to  read or watch the week’s lectures at any point  
It’s a place to express yourself to the world and  to share your thoughts and your passions   
In blogs entries are commonly displayed in reverse  chronological order  Most blogs are interactive  
allowing visitors to leave comments and even  message each other, via widgets on the blogs   
And it is this interactivity that  distinguishes them from other static websites   
Many blogs provide commentary  or news on a particular subject,  
others function as more personal online  diaries  A typical blog combines text,  
images and links to other blogs, web pages and  other media related to its topic  The ability  
of readers to leave comments in an interactive  format is an important part of many blogs   
Most blogs are primarily textual, although some  focus on art, art blog, photographs, photo blog,  
videos, video blogging and music MP three blog,  and audio podcasting  Collaboration Tools-  
during the week  Students may use email to submit  assignments to the teacher or ask questions   
All around the globe, we are witnessing the  transition towards collaborative learning   
The benefits of collaborative learning  are immense, it lets the learners gain  
from the experience of their peers  And  help them acquire and retain information  
in a more involved and engaged way  Thus, we  see most of the e-learning is also social,  
the learners learn through collaboration  with peers in smaller or larger groups   
The e-learning technology offers a number of  collaboration tools to learn from one another,  
to work on assignments, projects in groups and  the like  Some of the popular collaboration tools  
include chat, forum, wiki, online  groups, audio video conferencing,  
social bookmarking and social networking   Collaborative learning forums promote learner  
interaction through message boards, where students  can post questions and answers, text chat or  
Asynchronous learning opens up enormous  possibilities by divorcing education from the  
Online education is electronically supported  learning that relies on the internet for  
forums, where learners can communicate outside  the main classroom  And threaded discussions,  
where facilitators and students can discuss a  given topic and review each other's responses   
Wiki- A wiki is a collaborative website  that collects and organizes content,  
created and revised by its users  The  most well known example is Wikipedia,  
wiki’s are a way to grow a knowledge base around  a particular content area  Be it best practices in  
a particular field or how to use a specific piece  of software  There are many software which help to  
create online wiki and one of the most famous one  among that is Wordpress  Wiki is also a feature  
available in all the learner management system  In an e-learning context, wiki permits teachers  
to give many kind of task to the learners  to collaborate and create content on any  
topic  Wiki platforms are used extensively to  create and share open educational resources   
constraints of time as well as place  Teaching in a Digital Age- Teaching method  
Social Bookmarking- A social bookmarking service  is a centralized online service, which enables  
users to add annotate, edit and share bookmarks  of web documents  Social bookmarking websites  
enhance and improve the learning experiences by  encouraging group collaboration  They also help  
in organizing and saving web resources  faster and easier for students   
Social bookmarking services offer  greater scope for research, integration  
and collaboration compared to the more traditional  bookmarking applications, such as browsers which  
offer limited functionality  There are many  services which are available freely for crediting  
and sharing social bookmarks, and most famous  among them are Diigo, delicious and StumbleUpon   
Teachers can create social bookmarks of resources  
chapter-wise and invite other teachers  to contribute and annotate   
with no use of technology is not online  learning, but pure face-to-face teaching   
The social bookmarks thus created can be shared  with the learners, and teachers can also give  
assignments to learners to collaboratively build  social bookmarks related to a particular topic   
Social Networking Sites- Social networking site  is the phrase used to describe any website that  
enables users to create public profiles within  that website, and from relationships with  
other users of the same website who access  their profile  Social networking sites can  
be used to describe community based  websites, online discussion forums,  
chat rooms and other social spaces online  Examples include facebook, twitter, LinkedIn,  
Google plus, etcetera  Social networking can  be used effectively for e-learning by creating  
specific interest groups  The learners within this  group can share information, photographs, videos,  
graphics related to a particular topic  This  can also be used by teachers to collaborate in  
However, teaching without any technology is very  rare these days, at least in formal education   
generating and sharing resources online with ace,  thereby, facilitating learning  Web conferencing-  
Web conferencing is highly interactive  internet based applications with  
a rich collaboration feature   Set example audio video from presenters and  
learners, application sharing, white boarding and  markup tools, breakout rooms, bowling, quizzing,  
hand raising and emoticon responses, slides and  media, website tours, public or private text chat   
It is capable of scaling form small groups to  hundreds or thousands of simultaneous users   
In synchronous e-learning we refer to web  conferencing  Web conferencing technologies  
offer tremendous potential for robust  interactivity and collaboration through  
their versatility and rich feature options  There are many online tools for organizing video,  
web conferencing to facilitate collaborative  learning, applications like BigBlueButton   
Then there is a use of technology as a classroom  aid which may or may not be online learning    
Content creation Tools or authoring tools-  An e-learning content authoring tool is  
a software package, which developers use  to create and package e-learning content,  
deliverable to the end users   According to Wikipedia dot org, a  
content authoring tool is a software  application used to create multimedia content  
typically for delivery on the World Wide Web   Content-authoring tools may also create content  
in other file formats so the training  can be delivered on a CD-Compact Disc,  
or in other formats for various different uses  The category of content-authoring tools includes  
HTML, Flash, and various types of e-learning  authoring tools  Thus, e-learning authoring  
tools are a class of products designed for  people, who need to create online educational or  
training courses, that are deployed from a  standard cloud-based learning management system   
For instance an instructor using a projector,  and PowerPoint slides would not be using online  
Many programs can be considered authoring tools  including Flash and PowerPoint  However, only  
a small group of programs specifically include  support for e-learning content standards, such as  
‘SCORM’ sharable content object reference  model  There are many propriety as well as  
open source authoring tools available  currently in the market    
Some of the most famous propriety  authoring tools are Elucidate, Lectora,  
There are also many open sourcing  authoring tools which have many features   
They are Learner Activity Management system  LAMS, Adapt, Xerte and ExeLearning    
In addition to these com compatible authoring  tools  There are many specific applications,  
necessary for creating content such as  image editing, video editing, audio editing  
learning  But, students being directed  to use a device such as a laptop,  
and animation tools to create multimedia  e-content  Currently, most of the LMS have its own  
inbuilt authoring tools to create e-content, due  to the convergence of the software features 
Short descriptions of the popular open source authoring  tools are given in the following section    
Adapt- The adapt authoring tool is an application  to allow you to quickly build responsive  
e-learning content  It is accessed through a web  browser, you can create an account, login, create  
courses and add assets, components and extensions   You can peer review and publish your e-learning  
content from the authoring tool  LAMS- Learner  Activity Management System LAMS is a revolutionary  
new tool for designing, managing and delivering  online collaborative learning activities   
It provides teachers with highly intuitive visual  authoring environment for creating sequence of  
learning activities  Xerte- Xerte is a fully  featured e-learning development environment  
tablet, or mobile phone to look at a website  during a classroom lesson would be a form of  
for creating rich interactivity  Xerte is  aimed at developers of interactive content,  
who will create sophisticated content with  some scripting and Xerte can be used to  
extend the capabilities of Xerte online tool  kits with new tools for content authors   
Xerte online tool kits is a server based suit of  tools for content authors  E-learning materials  
can be authored quickly and easily, using browser  based tools with no programming required   
Xerte online tool kit is aimed at content authors,  who will assemble content using simple wizards   
Content authors can easily collaborate on  projects  Xerte online tool kits can be extended  
by developers using Xerte  Exe learning-  The Exe project developed a freely available  
open source authoring application to access  teachers and academics in the publishing of  
web content, without the need to become  proficient in html or xml markup   
online learning  But, the classroom would  remain the main means of delivery   
Resources authored in exe can be  exported in IMS content package, scom  
one point two or IMS common cartridge formats  or as simple self-contained web pages   
Delivery and Distribution Tools- There are  many options to deliver e-learning today   
Most common approach is to deliver online  learning using a learner management system,  
which has so many e-learning tools and  technologies integrated in one place  The  
other approach gaining popularity currently  is massive open online course ‘MOOC’ format   
A massive open online course (MOOC) is a  model for delivering learning e-content online  
to any person who wants to take a  course, with no limit on attendance   
In addition to these two approaches, e-learning  can also be delivered as flipped learning  In  
which the typical lecture and homework elements  of a course are reversed  Web quest is an  
However, this could be considered a sub-branch of  online learning called blended learning   
inquiry oriented lesson format, in which most  or all the information that learners work with  
comes from the web  The e-learning could also  be delivered or distributed through websites  
as webcast, podcast, EPUB, streaming video,  webinars, virtual tours and games   
EPUB- Wikipedia defines EPUB as an eBook  file format with the extension EPUB that  
can be downloaded and read on devices like  smart phones, tablets, computers or e-readers   
It is a free and open standard published by  the International Digital Publishing Forum  
IDPF  The term is short for electronic  publication, and sometimes tiled EPUB   
Sigil is an open source EPUB authoring tool  and caliber is an open source EPUB reader   
Podcasting- Podcasting is a form of audio  broadcasting on the internet  The audio files  
are developed and distributed using <?>RSS</?>  to the computers of subscribed users    
Blended learning- Here the definitions are a little less  precise and is called blended learning, which in  
teacher-student interaction and the distribution  of class materials  Online education comes in many  
These files may then be uploaded to digital  music or multimedia players like the iPod   
A podcast can be easily created from a  digital audio file  The podcaster first  
saves the file as an MP3 and then uploads it to  the website of a service provider vodcasting that  
is video on demand casting is the same principle  as podcasting with the addition of video   
Podcasting or Vodcasting allows educators to reach  students using a medium that are accustomed to   
It can be used to interact with students and  parents beyond the school hours and can be a great  
facilitator to increase student engagement  Student created podcasts, vodcasts gives  
students the opportunity to enhance their  organization communication and technology skills   
Record classroom lectures provides supplemental  information, provide review sessions, record  
classroom discussions, interview with experts,  student projects are some of the uses of podcasts   
general means a combination of face-to-face,  teaching  And the significant use of online  
Therefore, podcast is versatile medium for  delivering e-learning specifically audio content   
Audio or video streaming- Streaming  audio or video is content send in  
compressed form over the internet and  displayed by the viewer in real time   
With streaming video or streaming media, a  web user does not have to wait to download  
a file to play it  Instead the media is sent  in a continuous stream of data and displayed  
as it arrives  The services offered by YouTube  are valued by e-learning providers world over   
Many institutions have created their own exclusive  channels for providing their e-content to the end  
users using YouTube  E-learning professionals used  to make their e-learning courses more interactive  
fun and informative using YouTube  In fact, it has the power to transform  
a potentially dull or complicated subject matter  into an overall exciting and engaging e-learning  
learning, especially outside the classroom, this  can take a number of forms  Flipped Classroom-  
experience  E-learning providers like Khan Academy  uses YouTube extensively in delivering their  
e-content  MOOC- Massive Open Online Course ‘MOOC’  is a new approach to delivering e-learning    
MOOC is a model for delivering e-learning content  online to any person who wants to take a course  
with no limit or attendance  E-learning Standards-  According to ISO, standards can be defined as  
"documented agreements containing technical  specifications or other precise criteria  
to be used consistently as rules, guidelines,  or definitions of characteristics, to  
ensure that materials, products, processes  and services are fit for their purpose"   
The goal of standards is to provide  fixed data structures and communication  
protocols for learning objects and cross system  workflows  This enables interoperability between  
applications such as learning management  system LMS or in-house developed content   
A flipped classroom is one where student do  preparation online before a classroom session,  
By providing uniform communication guidelines that  can be used throughout the design development, and  
delivery of learning objects  There have been a  number of efforts worldwide to develop standards  
for learning object interoperability  The standard supports interoperability,  
durability, manageability, reusability and  accessibility  These standards focus on  
content metadata, content packaging and runtime  communication to support tracking of student’s  
activities  To this end there are several  organizations working towards standards and  
to make sure learning content is interoperable  with various learning management technologies    
In recent years group like the aviation industry,  Computer Based Training CBT committee, AICC, the  
IMS global learning consortium, the institute  of electrical and electronics engineers, the  
alliance for remote instructional authoring and  distribution networks for Europe, the Dublin core   
for instance, watching a pre-recorded  video or lecture and online reading   
Shareable content object reference model  and can core have developed specifications  
or guidelines for various aspects of  learning object development and use    
Massive Open Online Course (MOOC)- A Massive Open  Online Course MOOC is an online course that has  
open access and interactive participation by means  of the web  MOOCs provide participants with course  
materials that are normally used in a conventional  education setting such as examples, lectures,  
videos, study materials and problem sets  Apart  from this MOOCs offer interactive user forums,  
which are extremely useful in building a community  for students, <?>41-30</?>* and professors   
Generally MOOCs do not change tuition fees or  provide academic credit, some of the famous MOOC  
providers are Coursera and Udacity  The  Indian MOOC initiative is known as SWAYAM   
Coursera- Coursera is an online education provider  that offers online courses, popularly known as  
Hybrid learning- Hybrid learning is one where the  whole classroom experience has been redesigned to  
MOOCs or Massive Open Online Courses from top  universities around the world  Currently, it has  
one hundred and fifty such university partners  from twenty nine countries around the world   
Coursera has also started partnering with  companies like IBM, Google and PWC, such  
companies are also launching courses on Coursera   Coursera has two main products- online courses  
and specializations  Specializations basically  consist of a sequence of online courses,  
designed to enable you to master a particular  topic  Some specializations have a capstone  
project as the last course in the sequence   Not all courses are part of specializations,  
but a majority of courses that are newly  launched are part of a specialization   
Udacity is a for-profit educational organization  founded by Sebastian Thrun, David Stevens  
focus on what the instructor thinks is best done  online, and what is best done face-to-face  In  
and Mike Sokolowski offering massive  open online courses MOOCs  According to  
Thrun, the origin of the name Udacity comes from  the company's desire to be "audacious for you,  
the student"  While it originally focused  on offering university style courses,  
it now focuses more on vocational courses  for professionals  Udacity is the outgrowth  
of free computer science classes offered in two  thousand eleven, through Stanford University   
SWAYAM- SWAYAM is a program initiated  by government of India and designed  
to achieve the three cardinal principles  of education policy, with access, equity  
and quality  The objective of this effort is to  take the best teaching learning resources to all,  
including the most disadvantaged  SWAYAM seeks to  bridge the digital divide for students who have  
<?>hitherto remained</?> untouched by the digital  revolution, and have not been able to join the  
hybrid learning students may spend fifty percent  or more of their time learning online    
mainstream of the knowledge economy   This is done through an indigenous developed  
IT platform, that facilitates hosting of  all the courses taught in classrooms from  
ninth class till post graduation to be  accessed by anyone, anywhere, at any time   
All the courses are interactive prepared  by the best teachers in the country,  
and are available free of cost to the residents  in India  More than one thousand specially chosen  
faculty and teachers from across the country  have participated in preparing these courses  The  
courses hosted on SWAYAM are in four quadrants  Video lecture, specially prepared reading material  
that can be downloaded or printed, self assessment  tests through tests and quizzes, and an online  
discussion forum for clearing the doubts   Steps have been taken to enrich the learning  
experience by using audio, video and multimedia  and state of the art, pedagogy or technology   
Lastly, fully online learning where  students do not come to campus at all,  
In order to ensure best quality content are  produced and delivered nine national coordinators  
have been appointed, they are AICTE for self-paced  and international courses, NPTEL for engineering,  
UGC for non-technical post graduation  education, CEC for undergraduate education,  
NCRT and NEOS for school education,  ignou for out of the school students,  
IIMB for management studies and NITTTR  for teacher training program   
SWAYAM platform is indigenously developed by  Ministry of Human Resource Development MHRD,  
and All India Council for Technical Education  AICTE with the help of Microsoft, and would  
be ultimately capable of hosting two thousand  courses, and eighty thousand hours of learning,  
covering school, undergraduate, postgraduate,  engineering, law and other professional courses   
It’s time to summarize this  session  We started with the  
but study entirely online, which is one form of  distance education  Characteristics of Online  
discussion of education through internet  Then the characteristics of online education  
were discussed, the different methods for teaching  in digital medium, such as flipped, blended and  
hybrid learning was also seen  The different  approaches of learning, the communication,  
collaboration and authoring tools etcetera  were discussed in detail  The module ends  
with a discussion on the different types of  e-learning and teaching methods  A picture of  
the popular online courses was also given  Well,  thank you for watching today’s program  Good bye   
Education- There are many terms for online  education, some of them are virtual education,  
names and the variety of styles, computer based  training, web-based training, internet-based  
internet based education, web-based education and  education via computer mediated communication   
The web edu project uses a definition of online  education that is based on Desmond Keegan’s  
nineteen eighty eight definition of distance  education  Hence online education is characterized  
by the separation of teachers and learners which  distinguishes it from face-to-face education   
The influence of an educational organization  which distinguishes it from self-study and  
private tutoring  The use of a computer network  to present or distribute some educational content   
The provision of two-way communication  via a computer network so that students  
may benefit from communication with  each other, teachers and staff   
Advantages of online teaching and learning- the  minimum requirement for students to participate  
in an online course is access to a computer,  the internet and the motivation to succeed in a  
training, online training, e-learning or  electronic learning, m-learning or mobile  
non-traditional classroom  Online courses provide  an excellent method of course delivery unbound by  
time or location, allowing for accessibility  to instruction at anytime from anywhere   
Learners find the online environment a convenient  way to fit education into their busy lives   
The ability to access a course from any computer  with internet access twenty four hours a day,  
seven days a week is a tremendous  incentive for many of the students   
Some of the main advantages of online learning  include, Convenience- twenty four by seven access  
Enhanced learning- Research shows the increased  depth of understanding and retention of  
course content, more meaningful discussions,  emphasis on writing skills, technology skills,  
and life skills like time management,  independence, and self-discipline   
learning, computer aided distance education,  etcetera are some of them  A few years ago online  
Leveling of the playing field- Students  can take more time to think and reflect  
before communicating, shy students tend to thrive  online, anonymity of the online environment   
Interaction- Increased student-to-teacher and  student-to-student interaction and discussion,  
a more student-centered learning environment,  less passive listening and more active learning,  
a greater sense of connectedness, synergy   Innovative learning- Student-centered approaches,  
increased variety and creativity of learning  activities, address different learning styles,  
changes and improvements can translate  to on-ground courses as well    
Improved Administration- Time to examine student  work more thoroughly, ability to document and  
record online interactions, ability to manage  grading online  Savings- Accommodate more  
students, increased student satisfaction, which  is equal to higher retention and fewer repeats   
education was unthinkable, now it is a reality,  and it has expanded beyond imagination   
Maximize Physical Resources- Lessen  demand on limited campus infrastructure,  
decrease congestion on campus and parking lots  Outreach- Give students options,  
reach new student markets, appeal to current  student’s thus increasing enrollments   
Disadvantages of Online Teaching and Learning-  
Before enrolling into an online course, you  should also consider some disadvantages of online  
education  E-learning course could lack  accreditation- it is always a good idea  
to check if the online course you are  interested in has its program accredited   
Legitimate schools are proud of their status  with accrediting agencies, and agencies are happy  
to accredit good schools  So, this information  shouldn’t be hard to find  If you earn a degree  
from a school with no accreditation, it can  be worthless and could leave you in debt   
The internet has allowed us to cross boundaries  that took a long time to cross, technology has  
However, this doesn’t necessarily mean you  wouldn’t learn anything, but if getting a degree  
is your main objective, please do check   Verifying an online programs accreditation  
is something that can save your time, money  and heartache in the long run  E-learning  
course could provide low quality education- Even  if online course is accredited, that doesn’t  
necessarily mean you will get your money’s worth  or time you invest, would be time well spent    
Use a search engine to find out all of the  details about the specific online course    
Dig the internet, you will find the information  that could help you make a final decision,  
on whether or not you should enroll  Face-to-face interaction- There is often  
a tendency to underestimate the impact of never  meeting the instructor and other students in the  
class  Building relationships with your instructor  and classmates will require more effort in an  
allowed us to learn and grow with people from  around the world  It has given access to new  
online environment than in a brick and mortar  school  More work and self discipline- Online  
courses typically require a greater amount of  reading and assignments than traditional classes   
Programs in general are improving the  quality of their online courses   
And this means that students will have to  do more to prove that they have mastered  
the material  Also online courses usually have  deadlines for assignments, quizzes or tests   
This requires a lot of self-discipline  in order to deal with the schedule   
Approaches to e-learning- Synchronous  versus asynchronous, blended learning,  
individual versus group, self-paced versus  instructor lead  Synchronous E-learning-  
In synchronous e-learning, communication  occurs at the same time between individuals  
and information is accessed instantly   It is characterized by real-time  
opportunities in work, learning and socializing   We are now witnessing a transformation  
﻿Hello, welcome to today's  session  Internet Utilities-  
Attachments- Some emails could be attached  with files, such as text, image, audio,  
video, etcetera these files are specified here  Body- The actual content is stored in this part   
This will be in the format of text  This field  could also include signatures or text generated  
automatically by the sender's email system  In  addition to text messages being sent over email,  
it is also possible to attach a file or other data  in an email  For example, an attachment could be  
a picture, PDF, word processor document, movie,  program, or any file stored on your computer    
However, because of some security issues, it  may not be possible to send certain types of  
files without additional steps  For  example, many companies will block  
dot exe files from being sent over email and would  require you to compress the file into a zip file   
Also, most email providers have file size  restrictions that would prevent any large  
which literally means network of networks   Uses of internet- Internet is very useful for  
files or programs from being sent over e-mail  Advantages of email- There are many advantages of  
email and the usage of email versus postal mail   Some of the main advantages are listed below   
Free delivery- Sending an email is virtually  free outside the cost of internet service   
There is no need to buy a  postage stamp to send a letter   
Global delivery- Email can be sent to nearly  anywhere around the world to any country   
Instant delivery- An e-mail can be instantly sent  and received by the recipient over the internet   
File attachment- An e-mail can include, one  or more file attachments allowing a person  
to send documents, pictures, or other files  within e-mail  Long term storage- E-mails  
are stored electronically, which allows for  storage and archival over long period of time   
Environmental friendly- Sending an e-mail does not  require paper, paperless, cardboard, or packing  
everyone  It is the superhighway of information   The cost of Internet has been reduced over time   
tape conserving paper resources   Email protocols-  
We have already discussed the e-mail protocols  in the previous session  Now, we can have a  
revisit of the common protocols used for email  services such as SMTP, POP, I-MAP, and MIME   
SMTP- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is the  standard protocol for email services on a TCP  
or IP network  SMTP provides the ability to send  and receive email messages  SMTP is an application  
layer protocol that enables the transmission  and delivery of email over the internet   
SMTP is created and maintained by the  Internet Engineering Task Force, IETF    
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is also known  as RFC eight hundred and twenty-one and RFC  
two eight two one  SMTP is generally integrated  within an email client application and is  
composed of four key components  Local user or  client-end utility known as the mail user agent  
The cost of the computer system, modem, and other  associated hardware is also likely to come down   
‘MUA’  Server known as mail submission  agent ‘MSA’  Mail transfer agent  
SMTP usually is implemented to operate over internet  port twenty-five  An alternative to SMTP that  
is widely used in Europe is x dot four hundred   Many mail servers now support Extended Simple  
Mail Transfer Protocol ‘ESMTP’, which allows  multimedia files to be delivered as email   
POP- Post Office Protocol POP, is a type of  computer networking and internet standard protocol  
that extracts and retrieves email from a  remote mail server for access by the host  
machine  Post Office Protocol is the primary  protocol behind email communication  POP  
works through a supporting email software  client that integrates POP for connecting to the  
In case, computer system is not available, one  can browse internet over the mobile phones   
remote email server and downloading email  messages to the recipient's computer machine   
POP uses the TCP IP protocols  tag for network connection and  
works with Simple Mail Transfer Protocol  ‘SMTP’ for end-to-end email communication,  
where POP pulls messages and SMTP pushes them  to this server  There are two versions of POP   
The first called POP two became a standard in the  mid eighty and requires SMTP to send messages   
The newer version, POP three can  be used with or without SMTP   
POP three currently supports several  authentication methods to provide  
varying levels of protection against  illegitimate access to a user's e-mail   
Most are provided by the POP three extension  mechanisms  POP three client support <?>SASL</?>  
authentication methods via, the auth extension  POP is a challenge or response protocol,  
All major smartphone support  browsing functionality   
which uses the MD five-hash function in  an attempt to avoid replay attacks and  
disclosure of the shared secret  Clients  implementing a POP include Mozilla,  
powermail, Apple Mail, and Mutt  IMAP- Internet Message Access Protocol  
is a standard protocol for accessing e-mail  on a remote server from a local client   
IMAP is an application-layer Internet Protocol  using the underlying transport layer protocols  
to establish host-to-host communication  services for applications  This allows the use  
of a remote mail server  The well-known port  address for IMAP is one four three  IMAP and  
POP are still both supported by the majority  of modern email servers and clients   
However, IMAP is a remote file server, while POP  stores and forwards  In other words the IMAP,  
The key to success of internet  is the information exchange   
all emails remain on the server until the client  deletes them  IMAP also permits multiple clients  
to access and control the same mailbox  When a user requests an e-mail, it is routed  
through a central server  This keeps a storage  document for the e-mail files  Some of the IMAP  
benefits include the ability to delete messages,  search for keywords in the body of emails,  
create and manage multiple mailboxes  or folders, and view the headings for  
easy visual scans of e-mails  IMAP is still used  extensively but is less important now that so much  
e-mail is sent via web-based interfaces such  as Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo Mail, etcetera    
MIME- Multi-Purpose Internet Mail Extensions is an  extension of the original internet e-mail protocol  
that lets people use the protocol  to exchange different kinds of data  
files on the internet, audio, video images,  application programs, and other kinds as well as  
The better the quality of information exchange,  the more is the usage of internet operations   
the ASCII text handled in the original protocol,  the Simple Mail Transport Protocol SMTP    
The Association of internet e-mail with SMTP  and mind standard is such that the e-mails are  
sometimes referred to as SMTP or MIME e-mail  The  MIME standard defines the content types which are  
of prime importance in communication protocols,  like HTTP for the World Wide Web  The data are  
transmitted in the form of e-mail messages through  HTTP even though the data are not an e-mail   
The features offered by MIME to e-mail services  are as follows  Support for multiple attachments  
in a single message  Support for non-ASCII  characters  Support for layouts, fonts and  
colors which are categorized as rich text  Support  for attachments which may contain executables,  
audio, images and video files, etcetera   Support for unlimited message length   
Online banking- Online banking allows a user to  execute financial transactions via the internet   
Large volume of information- Internet can be used  to collect information from around the world   
Online banking is also known as Internet Banking  or web banking  An online bank offers customers  
just about every service traditionally available  through a local branch including deposits,  
which is done online or through the mail and  online bill payment  Online banking offers  
several main benefits to depositors  It provides  a real-time view of finances and eliminates the  
need for numerous visits to a bank teller  It can also take the place of balancing a  
checkbook and other tedious tasks common to  paper-based banking  Depositors can monitor  
each transaction in an accessible user interface  to understand how credits, deposits, deductions,  
and payments affect their account’s balance  Banks  that offer online banking are sometimes called  
brick to click  Many of these banks still provide  branch services but support online options   
This distinguishes them from brick and mortar  banks, which offer no online services  Brick  
This information could relate to education,  medicine, literature, software, computers,  
and mortar banks are becoming extremely  rare in the age of digital transactions,  
and most banks have begun moving a number  of customer interactions to the web    
Online banking services- Open accounts-  You can open checking, saving,  
and other accounts online without the need to  print or sign anything  In the past, you had to  
sit with a personal banker during business  hours and fend off numerous sales pitches   
With electronic signature capability  The entire  process might take less than ten minutes    
Pay bills- Instead of writing checks to pay bills   Your bank can print and mail a check for you  
month after month  It's also possible to  transfer money to your pay electronically,  
even if the amount you owed  changes every month    
Transfer funds- Need to move money from your  checking account to your savings account,  
business, entertainment, friendship, tourism,  and leisure  People can search for information  
The internet is a worldwide system of  computer networks, which was conceived  
how about putting extra cash  into a certificate of deposit or  
opening a brand new CD  You do not need to visit  a branch or wait on hold to get those things done   
You can even link bank accounts at different  banks and zap money back and forth    
Deposit checks- When somebody pays you with a  check, there are several ways to deposit it,  
the fastest and the easiest option is to use  remote check deposit, snap a photo of the check,  
and submit it to your bank for payment   There is no need to visit a branch or  
mail the check-in  For more details, learn how  to deposit checks with your mobile device   
Stay informed- In addition to manually checking  your account online, you can use old-fashioned  
text messages to manage your account, check  balances, and more  Sometimes it feels like  
too much work to open an app and log in just to  find out how much you have available  Find out  
by visiting the homepage of various search  engines such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, etcetera   
exactly what types of services are available and  have you benefit from texting with your bank    
View history- Need to see if that check cleared?  Or how much your employer paid you? It's easy to  
view transactions online, download historical  statements, and search for specific events   
Advantages of online banking or internet banking-  Convenience- Banks that offer internet banking are  
open for business transactions anywhere a client  might be as long as there is internet connection   
Apart from periods of website maintenance  services are available twenty-four hours a day  
and three sixty-five days around the year  In a  scenario, where internet connection is unavailable  
customer services are provided  around the globe via telephone   
Low-cost banking service- E-banking helps  in reducing the operational costs of banking  
services  Better quality services can be  ensured at low cost  Higher interest rate-  
Teaching, virtual classes- Internet has completely  changed the way of teaching in our community   
Lower operating cost results in higher interest  rates on saving and lower interest rates on  
mortgages, and loan offers from the bank  Some  banks offer high yield certificate of deposits  
and don’t penalize withdrawals on certificate  of deposits, opening up accounts without minimum  
deposits and no minimum balance  Transfer  services- Online Banking allows automatic  
funding of account from long-established bank  accounts via electronic funds transfers   
Ease of monitoring- A client can monitor his or  her pending via a virtual wallet through certain  
banks and applications and enable payments   Ease of transaction- The speed of transaction  
is faster relative to the use of ATMs or  customary banking  Discounts- The credit cards  
and debit cards enable the customers to obtain  discounts from retail outlets  Quality service-  
E-banking helps the bank to provide efficient,  economic, and quality service to the customers   
Instead of physically going to the classrooms,  students can study at comfort of their home   
It helps the bank to create new customer  and retaining the old ones successfully   
Anytime cash facility- The customer can  obtain funds at any time from ATM machines   
Disadvantages of online banking or internet  banking  High startup cost- E-banking requires  
high initial startup cost  It includes internet  installation cost, cost of advanced hardware and  
software modem, computers, and cost  of maintenance of all computers    
Security concerns- One of the biggest  disadvantages of doing e-banking is the  
question of security  People worry that their bank  accounts can be hacked and access without their  
knowledge or that the funds they transfer  may not reach the intended recipients   
Training and maintenance- E-banking requires  twenty-four hours supportive environment,  
support of qualified staff  Bank has to spend  a lot on training to its employees  Shortage of  
They simply need to either subscribe to a  teacher for a fee or watch educational lectures  
trained and qualified staff is a major obstacle  in e-banking activities  Transaction problems-  
Face to face meeting is better in handling  complex transactions and problems   
Banks may call for meetings and seek  expert advice to solve issues    
Lack of personal contact between customer and  banker- Customary banking allows creation of a  
personal touch between a bank and its clients  A  personal touch with a bank manager can enable the  
manager to change terms in our account since  he or she has some discretion in case of any  
personal circumstantial change  It can include  reversal of an undeserved service charge   
Online reservation- A computer reservation system  or online reservation system is a computerized  
system used to store and retrieve information  and conduct transactions related to air travel,  
hotels, car rental, or other activities  Booking  and reservation system has turned out to be an  
that are available free on the internet  News and journals- All the newspapers, magazines,  
integral part of various industries such  as hotel booking, event organization,  
table booking, etcetera  travel booking, ticket  booking for train, flight or car, etcetera   
Appointment doctor, physiotherapist, personal  trainer, etcetera, cinemas, and so forth    
An online booking system has many advantages  And,  honestly speaking a few disadvantages as well   
Advantages- Online booking system  facilitates remote bookings and  
instant payments which is convenient to  both booker and the facility provider   
Unlike traditionally, bookings can happen  round the clock and all the information  
can be directly entered into the  system, which reduces human errors    
It’s easy to up-sell and cross-sell products  across categories since they can be displayed  
conveniently, the consumer can think about it  and can take his own time to go for it or not   
and journals of the world are available on the  internet  With the introduction of broadband and  
For example, easy reservation online booking  system offers a host of features that help  
hoteliers in selling not just accommodation  but other amenities and services as well    
Previously, in case of hotel bookings, guests were  not able to get the room view and other details  
prior booking or entering the premises  While a  responsive website and booking engine can display  
all the information accurately across devices,  which a guest can smoothly browse through  
and book their stay  Online booking systems  ensure convenience and comfort to guests,  
and a peace of mind  No last-minute rush to find  a hotel and fear of all rooms being filled up    
Now, disadvantages- Need stable internet  access for the guest to book while facilitator  
has to do all the technical setups to offer  online booking systems may it be railways,  
bus bookings, or hotel bookings   
advanced mobile telecommunication technologies,  such as 3G third generation, 4G fourth generation,  
Security- Though downtime and security  breach instances are rare  They are  
for real  Various precautions can be taken by  service provider like secure socket connection,  
PCI DSS compliance using reliable cloud service  providers like Amazon, AWS, and so on   
Transaction drops- In some instances, booker is  being charged for the services but the transaction  
is dropped at last moment resulting failure in  allocation of services like railway tickets,  
bus tickets, etcetera  Though these can be  taken care of by auto payment reversal mechanism  
it takes time to get the amount credited  Now, let us move on to summarize this session   
We started with an introduction to the important  communication method use today the internet    
A variety of uses such as huge information transfer,  virtual classes, reading books, chitchatting and  
social networking, etcetera  were discussed  Then the internet utilities such as e-mail, online  
and VoLTE, Voice over Long Term Evolution   The speed of internet service has increased  
banking, and online reservation were discussed  in detail with the merits and demerits of each   
tremendously  A person can get the latest news  about the world in a matter of few seconds    
Read books- We can buy e-books and read online,  
in nineteen sixty-nine by the advanced research  project agency ‘ARPA’ of the US government    
there is no need to <?>emark</?>  large wardrobes for keeping books   
Nor do we need to visit library  A single  mobile device such as tablet can make  
available thousands of books at fingertip   Electronic mode of communication- Internet has  
given the most exciting mode of communication  to all  We can send an email the short form  
of electronic mailing system to all the  corners of the world  Chatting- There are  
many chatting software that can be used to send  and receive real-time messages over the internet   
We can chat with our friend and relatives  using any one of the chatting software    
Social networking- People can connect with  old friends on social networking sites   
They can even chat with them when they are online   Social networking sites also allow us to share  
pictures with others  We can share pictures  with our loved ones while we are on a vacation   
It was created with the aim of creating a network that  allows researchers at one university, communicate  
People are even concluding business deals over  these social networking sites such as Facebook   
Online banking or net banking- The use  of internet can also be seen in the  
field of banking transactions   Many banks such as HSBC, SBI,  
Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, etcetera, offers  online banking facilities to its customers   
They can transfer funds from one account to  another using the internet banking facility    
Ecommerce- Internet is also used for carrying out  business operations and that set of operations is  
known as electronic commerce, e-commerce  Flipkart  is the largest e-commerce company in India   
The rival Amazon is giving stiff  competition to Flipkart    
Mobile commerce- Mobile commerce or m-commerce  refers to the commercial transaction that  
takes place over the mobile internet  Using the  mobile internet technology, many companies have  
with their counterparts at other universities   The Internet which comprises of thousands  
introduced mobile version of websites and mobile  apps to promote and sell their products  Customers  
can simply browse several through the products  and buy online through mobile internet   
Mobile wallet- Many companies offer the  service of mobile wallet to its customers   
Users must have a smartphone and  internet connection to use the service   
Users can pay an amount into their mobile wallet,  which they can use to make online payments such as  
bill payments, recharges, etcetera   Entertainment- Apart from a major source  
of knowledge and information, the utility of  internet in the field of entertainment cannot be  
undermined  We can visit various video sites and  watch movies and serials at our convenient time   
Technology of the future- Internet  is the technology of future   
In the times to come, offices would be managed  at distant places through internet    
of smaller regional networks, scattered throughout  the globe allows communication to take place  
Utilities on the internet- Internet is a global  system that can be used for sharing information,  
providing worldwide services and communication   Daily updates are easily and instantly available  
in the internet  Also, you can search for  any information that you are looking for  
in the internet  A lot of products and services  are sold and provided through internet today   
Once upon a time, telephone was considered  a fast mode of communication   
Now, internet has enormously emerged and replaced  telephone as swift mode of communication   
Some of the important internet utilities  such as email, online banking, and online  
reservation are described here   Email- Email stands for electronic mail   
It is the message distributed by electronic  means among computer users in a network   
An email will be sent from one user and can be  distributed to many  The email was initially  
between connected computers and online users   Today, the internet is a public cooperated and  
first used in the nineteen sixties  It took  its current form in the nineteen seventies   
In fact, some earlier systems required both  the sender and receiver to be online  Which,  
similar to have instant messaging works today   Let us see the parts of e-mail and their  
subdivisions in detail  The popular email services  which are available at free of cost include  
Structure of an e-mail  There is  a standard structure for emails   
Email contents are primarily classified as two,  
the header and the body  We are going to see  the contents come under the two subparts    
The header- The email header gives us common details  about the message such as the unique identity of  
the message  The details of the users of the  from and to ends are also stored here    
self-sustaining facility accessible to billions  of people worldwide  What distinguishes it from  
The email header consists of the following  parts  However, the exact contents of the header  
can vary according to the email systems that  generate the email message  Subject, sender from,  
date and time received on, reply to, recipient  to, recipient email address, attachments   
Subject- The subject part is the topic  of the message in most email systems   
If the content view of the folders is set to  view each messages separately  The subject part  
also will be visible with the user's name  The  subject fields are scanned by the spam scanners  
to evaluate the messages  Sender from, this  field describes the from address of the email   
This will specify the sender's email address   Usually, it will be the reply-to address   
Date, and time received on- This is the date and  time, the message received  Reply-to- This field  
describes the email address that will become the  recipient of the reply to the particular email   
other telecommunication networks is its use  of a set of protocol called TCP and ICP,  
When you reply, it will go to this email  address despite the sender email address   
Recipient to- This is the first last name of the  email recipient as configured by the sender   
The cc, that is carbon copy field allows you to  specify recipients who are not direct addressees  
listed in the, two field  For instance, you can  address an email to Jeff and cc to Linda and  
Steven  Although the email is address to Jeff,  Linda and Steven will also receive a copy of  
the message and their addresses will be visible to  Jeff and to each other  The field is optional   
The blind carbon copy bcc field is similar  to cc, except that the recipients are secret   
Each bcc recipient will receive the email but  will not see who else received a copy 
The addresses anyone listed in the two field remain  visible to all recipients  This field is optional   
Recipient email address- The email address  of the recipient is specified here   
Transmission Control Protocol, and  Internet Control Protocol  The Internet,  
Computer, hard drives, and storage devices are an excellent way to store data 
This was about the role of computers in education 
But we know it's not just the education sector, which computers have impacted 
They are of great use in every field 
Today, a life without computers is unimaginable 
This underlines the importance of computer education 
Knowledge of computers can propel once carrier in the right direction 
Computers are a part of almost every industry today 
They are no longer limited and specific field 
They are used in networking for information access in data storage, and also in the processing
Technology helps us to save time and effort by providing convenience at work 
and presentation of information 
Electronic learning- E-learning, or learning through computer and information technology
is fast become to solution of providing learning with the tools necessary to address the needs
of students, in order to provide good and standardized education 
Students can interact with the e-learning software, enjoy the colorful presentations,
play games, and answer the objective questions with personal involvement 
In recent years, schools and universities started to utilize the web and locker networks
as a platform for distance learning 
Tools like WebCT, Enspire, WebEx, and virtual classrooms of HP, IBM, etcetera, allow students
to understand, learn, and interact effectively, as the class experiences available online 
Due to the multifaceted advantages, information technology is becoming popular 
Students can log in from home or school, enjoy interactive presentations, watch a webcast,
or even participate in live discussions and quizzes 
E-learning includes computer-based training CBT and web-based training WBT 
CBT is the training where a computer program provides motivation and feedback in place
of a live instructor 
It can be delivered through CD-ROM, LAN, or the internet 
WBT is the training which delivers educational content through a web browser over the public
Internet or private intranet 
This type of training often provides links to other learning resources such as references,
emails, and discussion groups 
Basic components of information technology- The components of IT include hardware, software,
It may also include a facilitator who can provide course guidelines, manage discussion
boards, deliver lectures, and so on 
Virtual Class Rooms- This technology helps attract the students interest 
This concept involves a student with software that reacts and interacts, unlike a book 
So, it is possible to get immediate feedback on students actions like answer for quizzes
or requests for more information 
With the help of virtual learning, students can search databases, listen to pre-recorded
videos, discuss the related matters with teachers or other students through e-mails or discussion
groups, use appropriate resources to get and apply knowledge 
Hence, the students can get online education from remote places 
data, and people 
virtual classrooms are intended for the students who are unable to attend centralized classrooms
due to distant locations of institutions 
Role of computers in research- Computers have a very important role to play in research
activities 
It has become an essential tool for research, whether it be for academic purpose or for
commercial purpose 
You can find all kinds of information on the internet, and you can even discuss such problems
with people around the world 
Computers had led the way to a globalized information Portal that is the World Wide
Web 
These are the essentials for the proper working of the systems in IT 
By using World Wide Web, we can conduct primary as well as secondary research on a massive
scale 
Various computer programs and applications have eased our way into compiling our research process 
Role of computer in conceptual phase- The conceptual phase consists of formulation of
research problem, extensive literature survey, theoretical framework, and developing the hypothesis 
Computers help for searching the literature's for review of literature and bibliographic
reference stored in the electronic database of the World Wide Webs 
It can thus be used for storing relevant published articles to the retrieved whenever needed 
This has the advantage over searching the literatures in the form of books, journals,
and other newsletters at the libraries, which consume considerable amount of time and effort 
Hardware consists of physical components that form a computer system, or any other electronic devices 
Role of computers in design and planning phase- This phase consists of research design preparation,
and determining sample design 
Design and planning phase also consist of population, research variables, sampling plan,
review research plan, and pilot study 
Several softwares are available to calculate the sample size required for a proposed study 
The standard deviation of the data from the pilot study is required for the sample size calculation 
Role of computers in data collection phase- This empirical phase consists of collecting
and preparing the data for analysis 
In research studies, the preparation and inputting data is the most labour intensive and time-consuming
aspect of the work 
Both hardware and software are necessary to run a computer system 
Typically, the data will be initially recorded on a questionnaire or record suitable for
its acceptance by the computer 
To do this, the researcher in conjunction with the statistician and the programmer will
convert the data into Microsoft Word file or Excel spreadsheet, or any statistical software
data file 
This data can be directly open with the statistical software for analysis 
The data obtained from the subjects are stored in computers are Word files or Excel spreadsheets,
or any statistical software data file 
This has the advantage of making necessary corrections or editing the whole layout of
the tables if needed, which is impossible or time-consuming in case of writing in papers 
Examples include keyboard, monitor, mobile phones, etcetera 
Thus, computers help in data entry, data editing, data management, including follow up actions 
Computers also allow for greater flexibility in recording the data while they are collected
as well as greater ease during the analysis of this data 
Examples of editors are WordPad, SPSS data editor, Word Processor, and Ultra edit, etcetera 
Most researchers are anxious about seeing the data, what they look like, how they are
distributed, etcetera 
So, you can also examine different dimension of variables or plot them in various charts
using a statistical application 
Role of computers in data analysis- This phase consists of the analysis of data, hypothesis
testing and generalizations and interpretation 
Software is a set of instructions in the form of programs, which control the sequence of
Data analysis phase mainly consists of statistical analysis of the data and interpretation of results 
Many softwares are now available to perform the mathematical part of the research process,
that is the calculations using various statistical methods 
Softwares like SPSS and Spreadsheets are the widely used, they can be like calculating
the sample size for a proposed study, hypothesis testing, and calculating the power of the
study 
Familiarity with anyone package will sufficient to carry out the most intricate statistical analysis 
Computers are useful not only for statistical analysis 
But, also to monitor the accuracy and completeness of the data as they are collected 
These softwares also display the results in graphical chart or graph form 
tasks to be carried out 
Consider any profession, computers have changed the way they work 
Role of computer in research publication- This phase consists of preparation of the
report or presentation of the results, that is formal write up of conclusions reached 
This is the research publication phase, the research article, research paper, research
thesis, or research dissertation is typed in word processing software and converted
to portable data format that is PDF and stored and republished in the World Wide Web 
Online sites are available through we can convert our Word file into any format like
HTML, PDF, etcetera 
Various online applications are also available for these purposes 
Even we prepare our document using online word processing software and can store edit
or access it from any way using internet 
Software runs along with hardware 
Career opportunities in the IT industry- The Fast spread of IT has generated a need for
highly trained workers to design and develop new information systems and to integrate new
technologies in them 
IT professionals plan, design, develop, support, and manage strategies and adapt them to fulfill
basic objectives of the firm 
The rapidly changing technologies require the employees to have more skills and education 
Apart from the traditional jobs like programmer, system analyst, network administrator, etcetera 
Some of the career opportunities available in the industry are IT consultant 
The job of an IT consultant is to evaluate the systems and do the research that no one
else entirely understands 
For example, the software present in computer system helps to interact with the systems
It is one of the most recent best job in the field 
Cloud architect- Although the storage space existing in the <?>ether<?>* can't be touched
literally, it still needs to be organized and given an architecture 
That is what this job is for 
Computer forensic investigator- As the use of computer and IT are growing rapidly 
The crimes related to the electronic media called cybercrimes are also getting increased 
Computer forensic investigators search for identify and evaluate information from computer
systems often for trial evidence 
They usually work for the government and related agencies 
Health IT specialists- Health IT is a blossoming field, especially with major changes going
and helps to run specific applications like calculator playing videos, etcetera 
on in health care due to the Affordable Care Act, and the gradual transition to electronic
health records 
Health IT specialist will mix computer knowledge with record-keeping skills 
But, specialties in medical coding, billing, and cancer registry are also in demand 
Mobile app developer- Now, most people you know have smartphones and or tablet computers 
The use of mobile tech is exceeded personal computers at some time in two thousand thirteen 
So, business are more heavily relying on it professional with experience in this field
than ever before 
Using basic coding languages, developers will create programs for future iOS and Android
devices 
Data are unprocessed representation of information in various fields that can be communicated
Geospatial professionals- Geographic information systems are complicated, but exciting every day 
GIS tech uses geographic data to evaluate and communicate trends and patterns in visually
stylish and comprehensive ways 
Information technology and internet- The greatest strength of internet is, its ability to support
simultaneous interactive communication among different people 
Internet allows information to flow back and forth among multiple users at the same time 
The information residing on different computers around the world can be easily linked together
using hyperlinks, which is a method of organizing information on the system by linking one document
to another 
The services provided by internet include e-mail, newsgroup, file transfer, multimedia
with the system easily 
displays, live-broadcasting, shopping opportunities, and much more 
E-mails allow the user to send and receive electronic mails for transferring text messages
across a network 
This is considered to be the fastest and reliable technology for sending information 
And newsgroup is a forum formed for the discussion on a particular subject in which the notes
on a website are accessed and redistributed through a worldwide network of new discussion groups 
They are hierarchically organized indicating major subjects, categories, and subcategories 
Users can create new newsgroups, post to existing newsgroups, and respond to previous posts 
Webcasting refers to the use of the web to deliver or broadcast by streaming live or
delayed versions of sound or video 
Data can be meaningful or meaningless 
Webcasting has potential applications in academic courses, presentations, on-demand programs,
live events, and training materials 
In this session, the importance of information technology is described in detail 
The role of IT in education, like creating better teaching and learning environments,
and in research for better outcomes are described 
We have also seen, some of the most demanded IT jobs 
Hope you enjoyed this session 
See you next time 
Until then, bye
Data can be collected for communication, processing, or analyzing 
People play an important role in IT 
The various processing functions are performed with the help of both hardware and software 
Computers and IT are important in different areas such as education, research, business,
Therefore, it’s only natural that the role of computers in education and research has
industry, healthcare, publishing, defense, and many more 
Here we will see in detail the role of computers in education and research 
Computer technology has had a deep impact on the education sector 
Computers played an important role in imparting education to become easier and much more interesting
than before 
Owing to the memory capacities of computers, large chunks of data can be stored in them 
They enable quick processing of data with very less or no chances of errors in processing 
Network the computers aid, quick communication, and enable web access 
Storing documents on computers in the form of soft copies instead of hard ones helps
to save paper 
been given much importance in recent years 
The use of computer in education is started in nineteen seventies 
The advantages of computers in education primarily include storage of information, quick data
processing, audio-visual aids in teaching, better presentation of information, access
to the internet, quick communication between students, teachers, and parents 
Computer teaching plays a key role in the modern education system 
Students find it easier to refer to the internet than searching for information in fat books 
The process of learning has gone beyond learning from prescribed textbooks 
Internet is a much larger and easier to access storehouse of information 
When it comes to storing retrieved information 
It is easily done on computers than maintaining handwritten notes 
This is also why the education system has included IT as a part of school curriculum 
Computers are a brilliant aid in teaching- Online Education has revolutionized the education industry 
Computer technology has made the dream of distance learning a reality 
Education is no longer limited to classrooms 
It has reached far and wide, thanks to computers 
Physically distant locations have come closer due to internet accessibility 
So, even if students and teachers are not in the same premises, they can very well communicate
with one another 
There are many online educational courses whereby students are not required to attend
classes or be physically present for lectures 
They can learn from the comfort of their homes and adjust timings as per their conveniences 
Considering the use of computer technology in almost every sphere of life, it is important
Computers have given impetus to distance education- Computers facilitate effective presentation
of information 
Presentation software, like PowerPoint and animation software like Flash, among others,
can be of great help to teachers while delivering lectures 
Computers facilitate audio-visual representation of information, thus making the process of
learning interactive and interesting 
Computer-Aided teaching adds a fun element to education 
Teachers hardly use chalk and board today 
They bring presentations on a flash drive, plug it into a computer in the classroom,
and then teaching begins 
for everyone to have at least the basic knowledge of using computers and technology 
There is colour, there is sound there is movement the same all information comes forth in a
different way and learning becomes fun 
The otherwise not so interesting lessons become interesting due to audio-visual effects 
Due to the visual aid, difficult subjects can be explained in better ways 
Computer software help better presentation of information- Internet can play an important
role in education 
As it is an enormous information base 
It can be harmnessed for retrieval of information on a variety of subjects 
The Internet can be used to refer to information on different subjects, both teachers and students
benefit from the internet 
The information age began with the invention of the telegraph transmitter, and receiver 
Teachers can refer to it for additional information and references on the topics to be taught 
Students can refer to web sources for additional information on subjects of their interest 
The internet helps teachers set test papers, frame questions for home assignments, and
decide project topics 
And not just academics teachers can use web sources for ideas on sports competitions,
extracurricular activities, picnics, parties, and more 
Computers enable access to the internet which has information on literally everything 
Computers enable storage of data in the electronic format, thereby saving paper 
Memory capacities of computer storage devices are in gigabytes 
This enables them to store huge chunks of data 
The information is the process data on which decisions are taken and consequent actions
Moreover, these devices are compact, they occupy very less space, it store large amounts
of data 
Both teachers and students benefit from the use of computer technology 
Presentations, notes, and test papers can be stored and transferred easily over computer
storage devices 
Similarly, students can submit homework and assignments as soft copies, the process becomes
paperless, thus saving paper 
Plus, the electronic format makes data storage more durable 
Electronically erasable memory devices can be used repeatedly 
They offer robust storage of data and reliable data retrieval 
are performed 
﻿Hi friends, now we will have an  introduction to Artificial Intelligence   
proposal was to allow a human-called interrogator  to communicate with a test subject by means of  
a typewriter system without being told whether  the test subject was a human or a machine    
Here the machine should behave intelligently,  so that the interrogator can distinguish it from  
a human  To conduct this test, there  will be two people and one machine   
The person who plays the role of interrogator will  be in a separate room from the computer and the  
other person  The interrogator can ask questions  by typing and also receive typed responses    
The interrogator tries to determine which is  person and which is the machine  The goal of  
the machine is to make the interrogator believe  that it is the person  If it succeeds at this,  
then we can conclude that the machine can  think  A well-known example of the Turing test,  
the result of the program, Doctor  Elissa  developed by Joseph Weizenbaum,  
better  This definition provides a good outline  of what constitute AI and avoids the philosophical  
it is an interactive program  conducting a psychological interview   
Some of you might have experienced it   The computer plays the role of the analyst  
while the user plays as the patient   The purpose of developing Doctor was  
to study the natural language communication   Internally, doctor restructures the statements  
made by the patient according to some predefined  rules and directs them back to the patient    
For example, his response to the statement 'I  am tired today', the doctor replies as 'Why  
do you think you are tired today?' Instead of  <?> ‘Gone' or 'that is very interesting'</?>   
Doctor projected the image of comprehension so  strongly that many who communicated with it became  
complained to the machine’s  question and answer dialogue   
Hence, the doctor passes the Turing test   The other examples which passed Turing test  
issues that dominate attempts to define the  meaning of either artificial or intelligence   
include internet viruses that carry on  intelligent dialogues with a human victim  
to trick him into dropping his malware guard and  computer games such as Chess playing programs   
The robot dogs that project adorable  personalities by tilting their heads  
or lifting ears in response to a sound  are examples of intelligent robotics   
Perception- Understanding the input from  the sensors to exhibit intelligent response  
is called perception or perceiving ability   Perception involves interpreting sights, sounds,  
smells and touch  Action includes the ability to  navigate through the world and manipulate objects   
If we want to build robots that live in the world,  we must understand these processes  Most of AI  
is concerned with only cognition, we will  simply add sensors and actuators to them   
But, the problems in perception and actions  are substantial in their own right, and are  
Some philosophical issues- Now, the problem  areas of AI are the domains that require  
being tackled by researchers in the field  of robotics  Two main challenging aspects of  
research in perception are image  processing and language processing   
Image Processing- An image is recognized using an  optical character reader, but it has a limitation  
that a certain degree of uniformity for the style,  size and orientation of the symbols are required   
The bit pattern produced by a physically large  character does not match the template for a  
smaller version of the same symbol,  even though the shapes are the same   
So, it has increased difficulty while  trying to process handwritten material   
Another approach of character  recognition is based on  
matching the geometric characteristics rather  than the exact appearance of the symbols   
This involves two steps  First, extract the  features from the image being processed   
only specialized expertise without the  assistance of common-sense knowledge   
Second, compare the features to those of not  symbols  But minor errors in the image can  
produce a set of entirely different geometric  features as between a three and an eight    
The task of understanding general images is  usually a two-step process of image processing  
and image analysis  Image Processing refers to  identifying characteristics of the Image and Image  
Analysis refers to the process of understanding  the meaning of these characteristics   
Image Processing involves various subjects  One  is edge enhancement, which is the process of  
applying mathematical techniques to clarify the  boundaries between regions in an image  It is  
an attempt to convert a photograph into a line  drawing  Another activity is smoothing, which  
is the process of removing imperfections in the  image  Smoothing keeps errors in the image from  
confusing the other image processing steps   Image Analysis is the process of determining  
There are expert systems in everyday operation  throughout all areas of industry and government   
what the identifying components  represent and what the image means   
Region finding is an activity in  image analysis in which those areas  
in an image that have common properties such as  brightness, colour, or texture are identified   
There are numerous problems associated  with general image analysis    
Language Processing- Another perception problem is  that of understanding languages  It is the process  
of a computer extracting meaningful information  from natural language  In theory, natural language  
processing or NLP is a very attractive  method of human computer interaction    
Natural language understanding is sometimes  referred to as an AI complete problem, because  
it seems to require extensive knowledge about the  outside world and the ability to manipulate it   
Whether NLP is distinct from or identical  to the field of computational linguistics  
These systems try to solve partially or  completely significant practical problems,  
is a matter of perspective  The association  for computational linguistics defines  
the latter as focusing on the  theoretical aspects of NLP    
The success in translating formal high-level  programming languages into machine language led  
researchers to believe that the ability to program  computers to understand natural language was easy   
But programming languages are constructed  from well-designed primitives so that each  
statement has only one grammatical  structure and only one meaning    
But a statement in natural language can have  multiple meanings depending on its context   
To reveal the meaning of a statement in natural  language, several levels of analysis is required   
The first one is syntactic analysis in  which parsing is done, it has the role of  
identifying the grammar of the statement  Another level of analysis is called semantic  
which previously required limited human expertise   But the early works were focused on formal tasks  
analysis  It tries to identify the  action, the agent of that action,  
and the object of that action  The other  levels of analysis is, Context analysis   
At this level, the context of the sentence  is brought into the understanding process   
Another area of research in natural  language processing concerns  
an entire document rather than individual  sentences  The two categories of problems  
to be considered here are information  retrieval and information extraction   
Information Retrieval refers to the task of  identifying documents that relate to the topic  
at hand  An example is finding the sites related  to a particular topic from the World Wide Web   
The current state is to search for keywords,  but this often produces false leads   
A search mechanism that understands the contents  of the site is to be considered  This leads  
like game playing, and theorem proving   Another area AI focused on the sort of problem  
to the techniques called Semantic Web   Information extraction refers to the task of  
extracting information from documents so that it  takes a form that is useful in other applications   
The system makes use of several templates   Semantic net is a large linked data structure  
in which pointers are used to indicate  association among the data items    
And it's time to summarize the session  This  module gives an introduction to the world of  
artificial intelligence, which makes the  computer systems to behave with sense   
It takes intelligent decisions with the help  of knowledge it acquired through learning  This  
module refers to the various techniques used  for solving artificial intelligent problems,  
and describes about the intelligent agents   The Turing test is mentioned here and two of  
the challenging problems such as the image  processing and language processing are explained   
solving called common sense reasoning  It  includes reasoning about physical objects,  
Before moving to the next session, please  try to answer the following questions   
What are the different types of intelligent  actions that might be made by an agent? Explain  
Turing Test? List the various techniques used in  AI? Explain any of the challenging problems in AI?  
Hope you enjoyed the session  See you next  time  Until then, goodbye  Take care 
and their relationships to each other, and  reasoning about actions and their consequences   
Artificial Intelligence or AI is the branch of  computer science that tries to build machines,  
As a result of research in AI, perception,  natural language processing, problem solving  
in specialized domains, such as medical diagnosis  and chemical analysis were attempted    
Perception involves interpreting <?>sights</?>,  sounds, smells and touch  Action includes the  
ability to navigate through the world and  manipulate objects  But perception of the  
surrounding world is crucial  Animals with  much less intelligence than people have more  
sophisticated visual perception than machines   These types of tasks involve analog signals,  
which are very noisy and large number  of things must be perceived at once    
The ability to use language to communicate  ideas is perhaps the most significant thing  
that separate humans from other animals  The  largest part of human linguistic communication  
occurs as speech  Written language processing is  easier if it is written in unambiguous characters  
which can carry out complex tasks without  human intervention  For this, the machines  
than processing speech  We use language in  a variety of ways in different situations,  
that no single definition of understanding  is able to account for them all    
In order to understand sentences about a topic,  it is required to know a lot about the language  
as well as a good deal about the topic  to recognize the unstated assumptions   
The specialized tasks, which can be served  by the artificial intelligent techniques  
include engineering design, scientific discovery,  medical diagnosis and financial planning    
AI techniques- AI technique is  a method of exploiting knowledge  
that should be represented in such a way that  
the knowledge captures generalizations, it  is not necessary to represent separately  
each individual situation  It should be understood  by people who must provide it  It should be  
will be able to perceive and <?>0-36</?>  The desire to build machines that mimic human  
modified to correct errors and to reflect changes  in the world and in our view of the world    
It should be used in many situations,  even if it is not completely accurate   
It should be used to help overcome its own bulk  by helping to narrow the range of possibilities  
that must usually be considered  The AI  technique must be designed so as to preserve  
the constraints imposed by the AI problems, but  there will be some degree of independence between  
problems and Problem-Solving techniques   However, the AI problems can be solved  
without using AI techniques and AI  techniques can be used to solve non-AI  
problems  The three important AI techniques are  Search, Use of Knowledge and Abstraction    
Search- It is a way of solving problems for  which no more direct approach is available   
If any direct techniques are available, they can  be embedded into a framework  Use of knowledge-  
behaviour has a long history  But the modern  field of artificial intelligence had its origins  
It is a method of solving complex problems  by exploiting the structure of the objects  
that are involved  Abstraction- This technique  provides a way of separating important features  
from the many unimportant ones that  would otherwise overwhelm any process   
It is not possible to give a very  precise definition of an AI technique   
AI programs are easier to build using languages  that have been designed to support symbolic rather  
than numeric computation  LISP has been the most  commonly used language for AI programming  Another  
language used for AI programming is PROLOG  When  AI comes into the conventional programming world,  
AI systems are being written in general  purpose programming languages like C    
Intelligent Agents-  
The realm of artificial intelligence is large and  merges with other subjects such as psychology,  
in nineteen fifty, when Alan Turing, who is  considered as the father of AI published the  
neurology, mathematics, linguistics, and  electrical and mechanical engineering   
An agent is a device that respond to stimuli  from its environment  Most of the agents receive  
data from the environment through sensors and  affect the environment through actuators    
Microphone, cameras, air sampling  devices, etcetra are examples for sensors   
Some of the commonly used actuators are  wheels, legs, wings and speech synthesizers   
The artificial intelligence aim to build agents  that behave intelligently  The actions of the  
agent's actuators must be rational responses  to the data received through its senses   
To obtain more intelligent behaviour,  higher levels of responses are needed   
In order to adjust the actions  according to environment,  
the agent should possess higher levels of  knowledge  Hence, the storage, updation,  
article, 'Computing Machinery and intelligence',  in which he proposed that machines could be  
access and application of real-world  knowledge become a challenging problem  
in artificial intelligence  If the agent's  responses improve over time, as the agent learns,  
it can be considered as procedural knowledge or  declarative knowledge  Procedural knowledge is to  
learn how and Declarative knowledge is learning  what  Procedural knowledge involves a trial and  
error process by which an agent learns appropriate  actions  The approach used here is to punish  
for poor actions and reward for good ones  Acquiring declarative knowledge takes the form of  
expanding or altering the facts in an agent's  store of knowledge  An agent must be able to  
extract information from the data produced by  its sensors to initiate responses to stimuli   
This is called ability to perceive  But  perceiving speech and image is a tiresome process,  
and in some situations, the agent must generate  speech to be compatible with their actuators   
programmed to exhibit intelligent behaviour   Even though this field is in its infancy, some  
Now, we may see an agent that will provide a  solution to the eight puzzle  Eight square tiles  
labelled one through eight would be mounted in a  frame, which is capable of holding a total of nine  
such tiles in three rows and three columns  Among  the tiles in the frame is a vacancy into which  
any of the adjacent tiles can be pushed, allowing  the tiles in the frames to be scrambled  The  
problem here is to move the tiles in a scrambled  puzzle back to their initial positions    
The agent to solve this puzzle has the  form of a box equipped with gripper,  
a video camera and a finger with a rubber end  so that it does not slip when pushing something   
When the agent is turned on for the first time,  it's gripper starts to open and close as asking  
for the puzzle  When this scrambled eight puzzle  is placed on the gripper, it closes  Then the  
machine's finger lowers and begins pushing the  tiles around in the frame until they are back  
astonishing results has been produced, especially  in the field of gaming theory  In fact, artificial  
in their original positions  Then the machine  releases the puzzle and turns off itself    
The behaviour of an agent is judged by  observing the input response patterns  These  
two approaches are performance oriented  and simulation oriented  Maximizing the  
performance of an agent is performance  oriented and trying to find out how the  
responses are produced is simulation oriented   The researchers in linguistics are interested in  
learning how humans process language and operate  in simulation-oriented mode  But the researchers  
in the field of natural language processing  are interested in developing systems that  
can manipulate natural languages like document  translations and machines responding to verbal  
commands operate in performance-oriented mode  The Turing Test-The Turing test proposed by Alan  
Turing has been served as a benchmark in measuring  the progress in artificial intelligence  This  
intelligence or AI is the study of how to make  computers do things which at present people do  
﻿Hello, welcome to today's  session ‘Data Analysis’   
to create charts and other infographics designed  to make their findings easier to understand   
Tools used for data analysis- The growing  demand and importance of data analysis in the  
market have generated many openings worldwide  It  becomes slightly tough to shortlist the top data  
analysis tools, as the open source tools are more  popular, user friendly and performance oriented  
than the paid version  There are many open source  tools which doesn't require much or any coding  
and manages to deliver better results  than paid versions  Some of them are-

that the latter is oriented to business uses  while data analysis has a broader focus   
It is a free, not the pro one an open source  network analysis and visualization software   
It is one of the best statistical tools  for data analysis, which includes advanced  
network metrics, access to social media  network data importers and automation   
Gephi- Gephi is also an open source network  analysis and visualization software package  
written in Java on the NetBeans platform  Think of  the giant friendship maps you see that represent  
LinkedIn or Facebook connections  Gephi takes  that step further by providing exact calculations   
Applications of data analysis-  
Now, below are the various areas where data  analysis applications have been employed   
Policing or security- Several cities all over  the world have employed predictive analysis  
in predicting areas that would likely witness  surge in crime with the use of geographical data  
Types of data analytics- Data analytics is broken  down into four basic types- Descriptive analytics,  
and historical data  Although it is not  possible to make arrests for every crime  
committed  But the availability of data has made  it possible to have police officers within such  
areas at a certain time of the day,  which has led to drop, in crime rate   
Fraud and Risk Detection- This has  been known as one of the initial  
applications of data science*, which was  extracted from the discipline of Finance   
So, many organizations had very bad experiences  with debt, and were so fed up with it  Since they  
already had data that was collected during  the time their customers applied for loans,  
they applied data signs*, which eventually rescued  them from the losses they had incurred 
This led to banks learning to divide and conquer  data from their customer’s profiles, reason  
expenditure and other significant information  that were made available to them  This made  
Diagnostic analytics, Predictive analytics,  Prescriptive analytics  Descriptive analytics-  
it easy for them to analyse and infer if there  was any probability of customers defaulting   
Manage Risk- In the insurance industry,  risk management is the major focus   
What most people aren't aware of is that when  enduring a person, the risk involved is not  
obtained based on mere information, but data that  has been analysed statistically before a decision  
is made  Data Analysis gives insurance companies  information on claims data, actuarial data,  
and risk data covering all important decision that  the company needs to take  Evaluation is done by  
an underwriter before an individual insured,  then the appropriate insurance is set    
These days, analytical software is used for  detecting the various forms of fraudulent claims   
Risky claims are detected by red flag  indicators which can be examined  It is  
very essential to bring such claims  to the attention of administrators  
Descriptive analytics describes what has  happened over a given period of time   
due to the manner at which automation is  improving claims processing efficiency   
Delivery logistics- Well, data signs and  analysis have no limited applications   
There are several logistic companies  working all over the world, such as UPS,  
DHL, FedEx, etcetera, that make use of data  for improving their efficiency in operations   
From data analysis applications, these companies  have found the most suitable routes for shipping  
the best delivery time, most suitable means of  transport to select so as to gain cost efficiency,  
and many others  Also, data generated by these  companies through the use of GPS gives them enough  
opportunities to take advantage of  data analysis and data science    
Web provision- There is this general belief  that smart cities have fast internet speed  
provided either by their government or companies  present there, therefore declaring them smart   
As the name implies, descriptive  analysis or statistics can summarize  
Well, just because people can access Facebook  or YouTube at the speed of lightning doesn't  
necessarily make a city smart  Although  there may be the presence of fast internet,  
but this is just one thing  It needs  to be present in the appropriate place  
and accessed by the right people as well   The key component of this is being able to  
shift bandwidth at the right time and location   This can only be achieved by the use of data   
The main assumption is that commercial and  financial areas should have the highest  
bandwidth during weekdays, while residential  areas should get such on weekends    
The real truth is that the situation is more  complex than it looks and this can only be solved  
by data analysis application  For example, if a  particular community wants to get the attention  
of web development companies and high-tech  industries and make them establish there,  
raw data and convert it into a form that  can be easily understood by humans    
Data Analysis is the process of examining  data sets in order to draw conclusions about  
a higher bandwidth would be required  Only data  analysis could get this done effectively   
Proper spending- Another issue with smart cities  is the large amount of money spent on little work   
Small changes or landmark remodelling which one  would dismiss as unnecessary projects consumes  
so much money  Data Analysis applications  would target where taxpayer’s money would  
have a major impact on and the kind of  work that they would be adequate for it   
The targeting of where this money should  be spend would lead to the entire city's  
infrastructure getting a facelift with  a reduction of excess money spent   
Customer interactions- This is another one of  the applications of data analysis in insurance   
Insurance can determine a lot about their services  by conducting regular customer surveys, mainly  
after interacting with claim handlers  They could  use this to know which of their services are good  
They can describe in detail about an event  that has occurred in the past  This type of  
and the ones that would need more improvement   Various demographics may desire diverse methods of  
communication like in-person interactions,  websites, phone, or just email  Taking  
the analysis of customer demographics  with feedback can help <?>insurers</?>  
improve on customer experience depending on  customer behaviour, and proven insights   
A study recently carried out showed that a  lack of investment in technology was the cause  
customer dissatisfaction of the present generation  of insurance customers because they prefer using  
mobile and online channels, social media and other  recent mediums to interact with their agents   
However, the older generation still prefers  the use of the telephone  To improve the  
overall experience of customers it is best for  insurance companies to provide a wide range of  
communication methods for their customers   City Planning- One big mistake being made  
analytics is helpful in deriving any  pattern if any from past events or drawing  
in many places is that analysis is not considered  when pursuing city planning  As a matter of fact,  
web traffic and marketing are still being used  instead of the creation of spaces and buildings   
This really causes a lot of issues to power  over data due to influence on things like  
building, zoning and amenity creation   Models that are built will maximize the  
accessibility of specific areas or services, while  the risk of overloading significant elements of  
the infrastructure in the city is minimized  This  implies that it creates efficiency  We usually see  
buildings that are built on sports that looks  suitable but actually have a negative effect on  
other places  This is because such issues were  not considered during the period of planning   
Data analysis applications, as well as modelling  would make it easy to mark the outcome of  
erecting a structure on any spot    
interpretations from them so that better  strategies for the future can be framed   
Health care- One challenge most hospitals  face is coping with cost pressure in treating  
as many patients as possible considering  the quality of health care's improvement   
Machine and instrument data use has risen  drastically so as to optimize and track treatment,  
patient flow as well as the use of equipment  in hospitals  There is an estimation that a  
one percent efficiency gain will be achieved and  would result to over dollar sixty-three billion  
in worldwide healthcare services  Travel- Data Analysis applications help in the  
optimization of travellers buying experience via  social media and mobile or weblog data analysis   
This is because customer’s preferences  and desires can be obtained from this,  
therefore, making companies sell products  from the correlation of the current sales  
to recent browse, to buy conversation  through customized offers and packages   
Examples, Have the number of views gone up?  Are sales stronger this month and last?  
Data Analysis applications can also deliver  personalized travel recommendations depending  
make apply data analysis to energy management  and cover areas like energy optimization,  
smart grid management, distribution of energy  and building automation for utility companies   
Data Analysis application here focuses mainly  on monitoring and controlling of dispatch crew,  
network devices and make sure service outages  are properly managed  Utilities get the ability  
to integrate as much as millions of data  points within the performance of the network,  
which allows the engineers make use of  the analysis in monitoring the network   
Internet or web search- When  one mentions the word search,  
the first thing that comes to the mind is  Google  In fact, Google to some point can be  
Diagnostic analytics- The obvious successor  to descriptive analytics is diagnostic  
used in place of search on the internet by  saying Google it  Well, apart from Google,  
Each of these search engines is a result of data  science applications because they use algorithms  
to deliver the best results for any search  query directed them in just a split second   
In respect to this, Google is known to  process over twenty petabytes of data daily   
Of course, without analysis and data science,  this feat wouldn't have been possible   
Digital advertisement- Apart from web search,  there is another area where data analysis  
and data science serves a very important  purpose, digital advertisements  From the  
banners displayed on several websites to the  digital billboards seen in the big cities,  
all are controlled by data algorithms  This  shows why digital adverts get more CTR than  
analytics  Diagnostic analytical tools aid an  analyst to dig deeper into an issue at hand,  
the conventional way of advertisements  Targets  depend solely on the past behaviour of users    
The importance of data analysis applications  cannot be overemphasized because it is used in  
almost all areas of life, today  We can  see that having data is very important  
before making certain decisions  so as to avoid necessary issues   
Also, handling valuable data efficiency could lead  to several problems like different departments  
in an organization not understanding how to  make use of it, which would lead to data not  
used to its full potential or serving any purpose   However, data has become more available and  
accessible to more people, therefore no longer at  the disposal of data scientists and analysts   
Almost everybody within an organization can make  use of data for the increase of productivity  
and make very important decisions  Of course,  
so that they can arrive at a source of a  problem  Diagnostic analysis takes focuses  
proper use of data would have a positive impact  on business and even the society in general   
Analysis of education- The rapid advancement  of Big Data analysis makes it necessary for any  
organization to coincide it with their  management and measurement processes   
While considering the education sector, it  is now becoming essential to analyse data  
for the development of both learning and academic  activities  So, the analysis in education sector  
can be divided into two broader categories-  Learning Analysis, and Academic Analysis    
Learning analysis is the measurement  and analysis of collections of  
data about learners and their contexts for  making learning more and more effective   
Academic analysis is concerned  with the improvement of resources,  
processes and workflows of the academic  institution, through the use of learner,  
more on why something happened  This involves more  diverse data inputs and a bit of hypothesizing   
academic and institutional data  The following are  the applications of data analysis in education   
To help individual learners-  
LA can help individual learners to  identify their weakness and achievements  
and to relate their behavioural patterns  with others  Learner's motivation success,  
and confidence can be enhanced by providing  them timely information about their performance   
Suggestions on individuals’ activities can also be  provided to identify significant knowledge gaps   
Rapid achievements of learners are possible  through providing them access to the tools to  
evaluate their progress and to identify the  activities that produces best results   
To help mentors- Analysis can make it easy for  teachers to identify the students who require  
extra support and attention  Mentors  can utilize their time and effort from  
Examples, did the weather affect beer sales? Did  that latest marketing campaign impact sales?  
the analytical information on student’s  weakness and ability and can find proper  
interventions for individual students  They  can also identify the proper teaching practices  
that have the best impact on the students   To help developing curriculum and learning  
processes- Through analysis, it is convenient to  find out the flaws of current courses and contents  
and to improve the curriculum offerings  Through  the utilization of analyse data generated during  
real time learning activities, better curriculum  development and advanced quality learning can be  
achieved  Individual learner can receive resources  and training according to their knowledge, state,  
through the personalization and adaptation of  developed learning process and contents   
To help administrators- Administrators can  take decisions on different efficiency and  
effectiveness measures based on the analytical  information of real time data  So, it becomes  
Predictive analytics- Predictive analytics moves  to what is likely going to happen in the near  
the information they contain, increasing with  the aid of specialized systems and software   
easy for them to identify retention, progress  and completion factors of the organization  It  
is also possible to reduce attrition through the  early detection of at-risk students and generating  
alerts for learners and educators  Thank you for  watching today's program  Thank you 
term  Any business that is pursuing success  should have foresight  Predictive analytics  
helps businesses to forecast trends based on  the current events  Whether its predicting the  
probability of an event happening in future,  or estimating the accurate time it will happen  
can all be determined with the help of predictive  analytical models  Examples, what happened to  
sales last time we had a hot summer, how many  weather models predict a hot summer this year?  
Prescriptive analytics- This type of  analytics explains the step by step  
process in a situation  For instance, a  prescriptive analysis is what comes into  
play when your Uber driver gets the easier  route from G maps  The best route was chosen  
by considering the distance of every available  route from your pickup route to the destination  
and the traffic constraints on each road   Prescriptive analytics moves into the  
Data Analysis technologies and techniques  are widely used in commercial industries  
territory of suggesting a cause of action   Examples, If the likelihood of a hot summer  
as measured as an average of these five  weather models is about fifty eight percent,  
then we should add an evening shift to the brewery  and rent an additional tank to increase output   
Complexity of different  types of data analytics    
Advantages and disadvantages of data analytics-  Following are the advantages of data analytics   
It detects and corrects the errors from  data sets with the help of data cleansing   
This helps in improving quality of  data and consecutively benefits both  
customers and institutions such as banks,  insurance and finance companies    
It removes duplicate information from data sets  and hence saves large amount of memory space   
This decreases cost to the company  It helps  in displaying relevant advertisements on the  
to enable organizations to make more  informed business decisions, and by  
online shopping websites based on historic  data and purchase behaviour of the users   
Machine learning algorithms are applied for  the same  This helps in increasing revenue  
and productivity of the companies   It reduces banking risks by identifying  
probable fraudulent customers  based on historic data analysis   
This helps institutes in deciding whether to issue  loan or credit cards to the applicants or not   
It is used by security agencies for surveillance  and monitoring purpose based on information  
collected by huge number of sensors  This helps in  preventing any wrongdoings and or calamities   
Now, following are the disadvantages of  data analytics  This may breach privacy  
of the customers as their information suggests  purchases, online transactions subscriptions are  
visible to their parent companies  The companies  may exchange these useful customer data bases for  
scientists and researchers to verify or disprove  scientific models, theories and hypothesis    
mutual benefits  The cost of data analytics tools  vary based on applications and features supported   
Moreover, some of the data analytics tools  are complex to use and require training   
This increases cost to the company willing  to adopt data analysis tools or software    
The information obtained using data analysis can  also be misused against the group of people of  
certain country or community or caste  It is very  difficult to select the right data analysis tools   
This is due to the fact that it requires  knowledge of the tools and their accuracy in  
analysing the relevant data as per applications   This increases time and cost to the company   
Inside the data analysis process- Data  Analysis applications involve more than  
just analysing data  Particularly on advanced  analysis projects, much of the required work  
takes place upfront in collecting, integrating  and preparing data and then developing,  
Data Analytics is a broad term that encompasses  many diverse types of data analysis, especially  
testing and revising analytical models to  ensure that they produce accurate results    
In addition to data scientists  and other data analysts,  
analysis teams often include data engineers whose  job is to help get data sets ready for analysis   
The analysis process starts with data collection,  in which data scientists identify the information  
they need for a particular analysis application  and then work on their own or with data engineers  
and IT starts to assemble it for use   Data from different source systems may  
need to be combined via data integration routines  transformed into a common format and loaded into  
an analysis system such as Hadoop cluster,  NOSQL database or data warehouse    
In other cases, the collection process  may consist of pulling a relevant subset  
out of a stream of raw data that flows  into say Hadoop and moving it to a separate  
any type of information can be subjected to data  analysis techniques, to get insight that can be  
partition in the system  So, it can be analysed  without affecting the overall data set   
Once the data that's needed is in place, the next  step is to find and fix data quality problems  
that could affect the accuracy  of analysis applications    
That include running data profiling and  data cleansing jobs to make sure that  
the information in a data set is consistent, and  that errors and duplicate entries are eliminated   
Additional data preparation  work is then done to manipulate  
and organize the data for the planned analysis  use and data governance policies are applied to  
ensure that the data hews to corporate  standards and is being used properly   
At that point, the data analysis work begins  in earnest, or data scientists builds an  
analytical model using predictive modelling  tools or other analysis software and programming  
used to improve things  For example, manufacturing  companies often record the runtime, downtime and  
languages such as Python, Scalar, R and  SQL  The model is initially run against a  
partial data set to test its accuracy   Typically, it's then revised and tested again,  
a process known as training the model that  continues until it functions as intended   
Finally, the model is run in production mode  against the full data set  Something that can be  
done wants to address a specific information need  or on an ongoing basis as the data is updated    
In some cases, analysis, applications can be  set to automatically trigger business actions   
For example, stock trades by a  financial services firm  Otherwise,  
the last step in the data analysis process  is communicating the results generated by  
analytical model to business executives and  other end users to aid in their decision making   
That usually is done with the help of data  visualization techniques, which analysis teams use  
work queue for various machines and then analyse  the data to better plan the workloads, so that  
﻿Welcome to the session on  Heterogeneous data and storage   
a node or group of nodes fail  This fault  tolerance is built in on a software level   
Programs running in clusters must be able  to dictate and recover from a fault    
Writing fault tolerance distributed  programs is very complex   
So many distributed programs use frameworks for  error handling  One of these framework is the  
Apachian Map Reduced model which is currently  the main framework for Big Data processing   
The key features of a Distributed system  are- Components in the system are concurrent   
A Distributed system allows resource  sharing including software by systems  
connected to the network at the same time   There can be multiple components but they will  
generally be autonomous in nature  A global  clock is not required in a Distributed system   
The systems can be spread across different  geographies  Compared to other network models,  
computers and necessary hardware, software  services and supporting infrastructure  
there is greater fault tolerance in a distributed  model  Price performance ratio is much better   
The key goals of a Distributed system include,  transparency that is the ability of achieving  
the image of a single system image without  concealing the details of the location, access,  
migration, concurrency, failure, relocation,  persistence and resources to the users    
Openness refers to making the network  easier to configure and modify  Reliability,  
compared to a single system, a distributed  system should be highly capable of being secure,  
consistent and have a high capability of masking  errors  This is referred by the term reliability   
Performance  Compared to other models,  Distributed models are expected to give  
a much wanted boost to performance  Scalability   Distributed system should be scalable with respect  
to geography, administration or size   Challenges for Distributed systems include,  
is essential for the effective management  and delivering of information    
security is a big challenge in a distributed  environment, especially when using public  
networks  Fault tolerance could be tough  when the distributed model is built based on  
unreliable components  Coordination and resource  sharing can be difficult if proper protocols or  
policies are not in place  Process knowledge  should be put in place for the administrators  
and users of the distributed model   Types of Distributed systems - The nodes  
in the Distributed systems can be arranged in  the form of client server systems or peer to  
peer systems  Client server systems  In client  server systems, the client request a resource  
and the server provides that resource  A server  may serve multiple clients at the same time,  
while a client is in contact with only one  server  Both the client and the server usually  
communicate via a computer network, and so  they are a part of Distributed systems   
The use of mobile phones to make calls and send  text or multimedia messages, the use of websites  
Peer to peer systems - The peer to peer system  contains nodes that are equal participants in data  
sharing  All the task are equally divided between  all the nodes  The nodes interact with each other  
as required as shared resources  This is done with  the help of a network  Advantages of Distributed  
systems - Some advantages of distributed systems  are as follows, all the nodes in the distributed  
system are connected to each other  So nodes  can easily share data with other nodes    
More nodes can easily be added to the distributed  system that is it can be scaled as required   
Failure of one node does not lead to the  failure of the entire distributed systems   
Other nodes can still communicate with each  other  Resources like printers can be shared with  
multiple nodes rather than being restricted to  just one  Disadvantages of Distributed systems -  
Some disadvantages of distributed systems are  as follows, it is difficult to provide adequate  
for ticket reservation and business, use of  ATM machines for banking and of course the  
security in distributed systems because the nodes  as well as the connections need to be secured    
Some messages and data can be lost in the  network while moving from one node to another   
The database connected to the distributed systems  is quite complicated and difficult to handle as  
compared to a single user system  Overloading  may occur in the network if all the nodes of  
the Distributed system try to send data at once   Heterogeneous distributed DBMS  Heterogeneous  
systems usually result when individual sites have  implemented their own database and integration  
is considered at a later stage   In a heterogeneous system, translations  
are required to allow communication between  different DBMSs  To provide DBMS transparency,  
users must be able to make request in the  language of the DBMS at their locker site   
The system then has the task of locating the  data and performing any necessary translation   
social media requires enormous storage facility  to store different kinds of data or information   
Data maybe required from another site  that may have different hardware,  
different DBMS products or different  hardware and different DBMS products     
If the hardware is different, but  the DBMS products are the same,  
the translation is straight forward involving  the change of codes and word langs  If the  
DBMS products are different, the translation is  complicated involving the mapping of the data  
structure in one data model to the equivalent data  structures in another data model  For example,  
relations in the relational data model are mapped  to records and sets in the network model    
It is also necessary to translate the query  languages used  For example, SQL select statements  
are mapped to network find and get statements   If both the hardware and software are different,  
then these two types of translation are required   This makes the processing extremely complex   
This leads to Big Data and Cloud services   Heterogeneous storage - Large scale storage  
The typical solution used by some relational  systems that are part of heterogeneous DBMS is  
to use gateways which convert the language  and model of each different DBMS into the  
language and model of the relational system   Types of heterogeneous distributed databases are  
federated  The heterogeneous database  systems are independent in nature  
and integrated together so that they function  as a single database system  Un-federated - The  
database systems employ a central coordinating  module through which the databases are accessed   
Big Data - Big data is a term used to describe  data sets that are too big to process using traditional  
methods  A study by Lany has identified three  dimensions that force companies to adopt new  
architectural solutions and trade-offs    Volume - The amount of data has massively  
increased over the last decade  E-commerce  for example logs and processors,  
systems are crucial components in  the data intensive applications  
all use the transactions which leads to ten times  as much data as traditional sales  The scale at  
which data is stored and processed has moved from  gigabytes to terabytes and terabytes to petabytes   
Velocity - The speed at which data is processed  has increased and the expected response time has  
lowered  Companies move from  periodic batch processing to  
near real time or real time processing   For example, moving from product recommendations  
in ecommerce with which has a relatively  static product catalogue to recommendations  
for new articles which change by minute or  stock options which change every second   
Variety - The sources of data have become  more valid in terms of data structure format  
and semantics  These three aspects are commonly  referred to as the three Vs of Big data   
Other authors have added more Vs such as value,  which represents the increased financial gain  
such as search engine clusters, video on demand  servers, sensor networks and grid computing    
companies have from their data  Veracity, which represents the unreliability  
of Big data sources and volatility  which refers to how long data is valid  
and relevant  Because of these new challenges a  demand has risen for systems that handle data in  
new ways  Examples of approaches are taking  samples of the data process only a fraction of all  
data investing in more powerful infrastructure and  using different algorithms for data processing   
Compared to traditional relational database  management systems that rely on row based  
storage and expensive caching strategies  These novel Big data storage technologies offer  
better scalability at lower operational  complexity and cost  Despite these advances  
that improve the performance scalability  and usage ability of storage technologies,  
there is still significant untapped potential for  Big data storage technologies both for using and  
A storage server typically consists of a set of  storage devices  In such systems, data layouts  
further developing the technologies potential to  transform society and business across sectors    
Big data storage technologies are a  key enabler for advanced analytics  
that have the potential to transform society  and the way key business decisions are made   
This is of particular importance in traditionally  non IT based sectors such as energy   
While these sectors face non technical issues  such as the lack of skilled Big data experts  
and regulatory barriers, novel data storage  technologies have the potential to enable  
new value generating analytics in and  across various industrial sectors    
Lack of standards is a major barrier   The history of NoSQL is based on  
solving specific technological challenges which  led to a range of different storage technologies   
The large range of choices coupled with the lack  of standards for querying the data makes it harder  
may need to be reconfigured over time for load  balancing or in the event of system failure or  
The advancements in computers and information  technology makes the world changing drastically   
to exchange data stores as it may tie application  specific code to certain storage location   
Open scalability challenges in  graph based data sources    
Processing data based on graph data structures  is beneficial in an increasing amount of  
applications  It allows better capture  of semantics and complex relationships  
with other pieces of information coming  from a large variety of data sources   
And has the potential to improve the overall  value that can be generated by analyzing the data   
While graph data bases are  increasingly used for this purpose,  
it remains hard to efficiently distribute graph  based data structures across computing nodes    
Privacy and security is lagging behind   Although there are several projects and  
solutions that address privacy and security, the  protection of individuals and securing their data  
upgrades  It is critical to migrate data to  their target locations as quickly as possible  
lags behind the technological advances of  data storage systems  Considerable research  
is required to better understand how data  can be misused, how it need to be protected  
and integrated in Big data storage solutions   It is time to conclude the session  Information  
provides the power to find and evaluate  problems and make decisions effectively    
Every aspects of life is getting  changed due to the enhancement in  
technology which helps to collect more information  and process this huge quantity of data very fast   
The storage requirements and the  availability of stored information play  
an important role in this   Hence this module tries to find  
the storage of different kinds of data and  techniques used to make them available as and when  
needed  Hope you enjoyed this session  See  you next time  Until then, bye 
to obtain the best performance  A storage node  however can typically handle multiple transfers  
simultaneously and this can reduce the  total migration time significantly    
Moreover, storage devices tend to have  heterogeneous capabilities as devices maybe added  
over time due to the increase in storage  demand  The data replication mechanism  
of the storage system will have a  great impact on system performance   
The key points involved in the placement of  data replicas in heterogeneous storage systems  
include the determination of the number of data  replication and the location of storage    
The number of replicas has great influence on the  data availability of distributed storage systems   
Few replicas could easily lead to overhead of  partial replicas and overload of storage nodes   
Technology is the knowledge generated  for the purpose of developing new  
If the number of replicas is large, the storage  resources will be wasted  Heterogeneous storage  
systems choosing those nodes with different  performance and the different locations were  
replica storage effects the quality of  service when replicas are assessed    
The current replication placement  strategies can be divided into  
the source request placement  strategy, priority placement strategy,  
path placement strategy, neighbor node placement  strategy and random placement strategy etcetera   
Light weight adaptive replication is a  typical source request placement strategy   
The advantage is that the new replication  creation mechanism is triggered when the  
exiting nodes reach the placement threshold which  reduces the creation of redundant replicas    
Thus, reduces the cost of replication creation and  maintenance  The disadvantage is that the load of  
systems to help in solving practical  problems  In the current scenario,  
the storage node is easily exceeded resulting  in the unbalance load of the overall system   
The advantage of priority placement is that when  an axis request arise at the target storage node,  
the other storage nodes will transfer the same  replication to the visited node  As a result,  
the number of storage nodes is reduced   The disadvantage is that the hotspot are  
easily generated and the overall  system load is unbalanced    
The path placement strategy is simple and  convenient method to query all nodes on the  
request path when users access the replication   But it is easy to cause the data redundancy  
which increases the waste of storage resources and  the maintenance cost of replication consistency   
The neighbor node placement is mainly to  save the history of the replication access   
When a certain node is requested to  reach the threshold, it selects the  
the impact of technology can be seen in  all areas like home, office and market   
neighbor node as the new storage and makes  the node access to the neighbor node    
The advantage of random placement is load  balancing, hence reducing access latency   
The shortcoming is that the  number of replicas is too large   
Heterogeneous data - Heterogeneous data are  any data with high variability of data types  
and formats  They are possibly ambiguous  and low quality due to missing values,  
high data redundancy and untruthfulness  It  is difficult to integrate heterogeneous data  
to meet the business information demands   There are different types of data heterogeneity  
such as syntactic heterogeneity occurs when  two data sources are not expressed in the same  
language  Conceptual heterogeneity also known  as semantic heterogeneity or logical mismatch  
denotes the differences in modeling the same  domain of interest  Technologically heterogeneity  
Data collection, storage and analysis can easily  be carried out with the help of technology     
stands for variations in names when referring to  the same entities from different data sources    
Semiotic heterogeneity also known as pragmatic  heterogeneity stands for different interpretation  
for entities by people  Data representation  levels - Data representation can be described  
at four levels  Level one is reverse raw data  with different types and form different sources   
Level two is called unified representation   Heterogeneous data needs to be unified   
Also too much data can lead to high cognitive  and data processing costs  This layer converts  
individual attributes into information  in terms of ‘what-when-where’    
Level three is aggregation  Spatial data can be  naturally represented in the form of spatial grids  
with thematic attributes  Processing operators  are segmentation and aggregation etcetera   
Aggregation aids easy visualization and  provides an intuitive query  Level four is  
With the huge amount of data collected, we  are able to analyze and predict the weather,  
called situation detection and representation  The  situation at a location is characterized based on  
spatiotemporal descriptors determined by  using appropriate operators at level three   
Spatiotemporal means that they should take care  of both time and space related information    
A typical example is tracking of moving objects  which occupies a single position at a given time   
The final step in situation detection is a  classification operation that uses domain  
knowledge to assign an appropriate class to each  cell  Metadata - Metadata are crucial for future  
coding  For relational tables and some Extensible  Markup Language that is XML documents explicit  
schema definitions in Structured Query Language,  SQL, XML schema definition XSD or Document Type  
Definition DTD can be directly obtained from  sources and integrated into a meta model     
The XML technique is used for data translation   The tricky part is semi structured data such as  
model space exploration and many more  Information  is essential in all these applications,  
XML without XSD, JSON or partially structured  Excel or CSD files which contain implicit schemas   
Therefore the competence structural  meta data discovery, that is SMD  
takes over the responsibility of discovering  implicit metadata  Example entity types,  
relationship types and constraints from  semi structured data  Metadata management  
issues are important for an appropriate  interpretation of heterogeneous Big Data,  
detailed metadata are required   Some reports contain some metadata, but many more  
details such as about the specific sensor used in  data collection are needed for research purposes   
The collection of metadata and data provinces  is a major challenge when the data are collected  
under stressful situations  Distributed systems -  The term Distributed systems refers to a networked  
set of hardware or software components that  communicate only by message passing    
since information gathering is easier in these  days, we are often facing with information over  
Unlike many other forms of parallel computing,  Distributed systems do not have access to  
a shared memory  The lack of shared memory allows  them to be more scalable but introduces new  
problems with concurrency, timing, network  failures and independent node failures   
The term can be used for a large variety  of appliances such as sensor networks,  
the bit coin network and distributed databases   Due to the large amount of nodes in clusters,  
single node failures occur very frequently   Google reported a mean time to failure that is  
MTTF of four point three months for servers  in their data centers  For a cluster with ten  
thousand nodes, this translate to an average of  one node failing per twenty minutes  Because of  
the high frequency of node failures, the cluster  must be fault tolerant to be practically useful   
Data stored in the cluster should not get lost  and processing should not be interrupted when  
load and storage of information is crucial   Information processing is mainly done with  
Welcome to the session on E-Library 
Structured approach - Digital library provides access to much richer content in a more structured
manner, that is we can easily move from the catalogue to the particular book, then to
a particular chapter and so on 
Information retrieval - The user is able to use any search term belonging to the word
or phrase of the entire collection 
Digital library will provide very user friendly interfaces giving clickable access to its
resources 
Preservation and conservation - An exact copy of the original can be made any number of
times without any degradation in quality 
Space - Various traditional libraries are limited by storage space 
Digital libraries can largely differ in terms of size, scope and purpose 
Digital libraries have the potential to store much more information simply because digital
information requires very little physical space to contain them
When the library had no space for extension, digitization is the only solution 
Networking - A particular digital library can provide the link to any other resources
of other digital library very easily 
Thus, a seamlessly integrated resource sharing can be achieved 
Cost - The cost of maintaining a digital library is much lower than that of a traditional library 
A traditional library must spend large sums of money paying for staff, book, maintenance,
rent and additional books 
Digital libraries do away with these fees 
They may be maintained by institutions, organizations, or even individuals 
Disadvantages of the digital library - The computer viruses, lack of standardization
for digitized information, quick degrading properties of digitized material, different
display standard of digital product and its associated problem, health hazard, nature
of the radiation from monitor etcetera makes digital libraries at time handicapped 
Copyright - Digitization violates the copyright law as the thought content of one author can
be freely transfer by other without his acknowledgement 
So, one difficulty to overcome for digital libraries is the way to distribute information 
Speed of access - As more and more computers are connected to the internet, its speed of
access reasonably decreasing 
If new technology will not evolve to solve the problem then in near future internet will
Several institutions mostly academic have already started to maintain digital libraries 
be full of error messages 
Initial cost is high - The infrastructure cost of digital library that is the cost of
hardware, software, leasing communication circuit is generally very high 
Bandwidth - Digital library will need high bandwidth for transfer of multimedia resources,
but the bandwidth is decreasing day by day due to its over utilization 
Efficiency - With a much larger volume of digital information, finding the right material
for a specific task becomes increasingly difficult 
Environment - Digital libraries cannot reproduce the environment of a traditional library 
Many people also find reading, printed material to be easier than reading material on a computer
screen 
Difference between digital and traditional libraries - The most major difference between
Preservation - Due to technological developments a digital library can rapidly become out of
date and its data may become inaccessible 
Requirement for digital libraries - The internet and World Wide Web provides the motivation
and technological environment for the development and operation of a digital library 
The internet provides the TCP IP and or its associated protocol for accessing the information 
And web provide tools and techniques for publishing the information over internet 
In the digital environment it is reasonable to say that a central backup or archive should
be created at the national level which will store information output of the region as
well as information from outside the country 
Some of the requirement for a digital libraries are audio visuals - color TV, VCR, DVDs, sound
digital and traditional forms of libraries are being local versus being global 
box, telephone, etcetera 
Computer - Server, PC with multimedia, UPS, etcetera 
Network - LAN, WAN, MAN, internet, etcetera 
Printer - Laser printer, dot matrix printers, bar code printer, digital graphic printer,
etcetera 
Scanner - Scanjet, flatbed, Sheet feeder, Drum scanner, Slide scanner, Microfilming
scanner, digital camera, Barcode scanner, etcetera 
Storage devices - Optical storage devices, CD ROM, Jukebox, etcetera 
Software - Any suitable software which is interconnected and suitable for LAN and WAN
connections 
Being local versus being global - Being out of place is one of the general feature of internet 
Software - There a number of software packages for use in general digital libraries for notable
one see digital library software 
Institutional repository software which focuses primarily in just preservation and accessible
locally produced documents particularly locally produced academic outputs can be found in
institutional repository software 
Open source software for library automation 
Koha – Integrated library system - Koha is a promising full featured open source ILS
that is integrated library system currently being used by libraries all over the world 
For those who you out there unfamiliar of what an ILS is, well, this is a system of
keeping track of the operations of a library, payroll, expenses, purchases and most importantly
With the advent of network to communication and possibility of resource retrieve through
keeping track of the various media being shared out by the librarians patterns 
Many smaller libraries cannot afford to purchase install and maintain an ILS and Koha is a
perfect alternative 
Koha is built using library ILS standards and uses the OPAC, Open Public Access Catalogue
interface 
In addition, Koha has no vendor login 
So libraries can receive text support from any party they choose 
NewGenLib - NewGenLib or new generation library is an integrated library automation and networking
solution developed by Various Solution Private Limited and the Keshavan Institute of Information
and Knowledge Management India 
network, active domains of libraries change to be globalised both in collection and services 
In March two thousand five, NewGenLib version one was released and the versions two point
zero and two point one have come up later 
On ninth January, two thousand eight, NewGenLib has been declared open source software under
GNU GPL license by the Various Solution Private Limited Hyderabad, India 
Evergreen - Evergreen ILS is another option when researching open source ILS options 
Developed by Equinox Software, Evergreen is a robust enterprise level ILs solution developed
to be capable of supporting the work load of large libraries in a fault-tolerant system 
It too is standards compliant and uses the OPAC interface and offers many features including
flexible administration, work flow customization, adaptable programming interfaces and because
its open source cannot be locked away and can benefit from any community contributions 
Just in case versus just in time - Usually collection development is continuous process
Retrieval support functions of the electronic library system 
Bibliographic data retrieval - Bibliographic data retrieval is a well known function that
is provided by existing library catalogue systems and online data retrieval systems 
The user can retrieve bibliographic data to find a book, even if some of its title or
the name, publisher’s name, publishing year, number of pages and price are not known exactly 
The result of a retrieval can be displayed not only as a list of bibliographic data,
but also as a list of cover images 
Hypertext retrieval - Important data and concepts retained in the electronic library system
are linked to groups of other data which can be located anywhere in the world 
This function enables the user to skip from one concept or term found in the current position
to achieve library’s prophecy aim 
E-Libraries are also referred to as virtual libraries, E-Library system or digital libraries 
of a book two* and other position by the same concept or term appears elsewhere in the same
book or paper 
Skip from one book or paper to another book or paper stored in another library 
Jump from a list of bibliographical data, to an introduction of the author or the table
of contents or a position in the text of a book 
Jump from a book or paper directly to a coded document 
Check unknown meaning of term found in a book 
Keyword retrieval - Keyword retrieval enables the user to retrieve books and papers by inputting
a keyword defined by the user 
After full text retrieval, the result is displayed as a list of books in which books are listed
If library could not provide needed resources, it will not be able to meet uses requisition
according to closest match with the users request 
Display items can include also an indication of the context in which the word appears 
Retrieval using term hierarchy - The user can retrieve data to find a book or paper
by using a retrieval expression describing a hierarchical structure for books and paper
in addition to the retrieval of its title or the name or publisher’s name 
The roles of digital libraries in teaching and learning - A library is fundamentally
an organized set of resources which include human services as well as the entire spectrum
of media, example text, video and hyper media 
Libraries have physical components such as space, equipment and storage media 
Intellectual components such as collection policies that determine what materials will
instantly 
be included and organizational schemes that determine how the collection is accessed and
people who manage the physical and intellectual components and interact with users to solve
information problems 
Libraries serve at least three roles in learning 
First they serve a practical role in sharing expensive resources 
Physical resources such as books and periodicals, films and videos, software and electronic
databases and specialized tools such as projectors, graphics equipment and cameras are shared
by a community of users 
Human resources and librarians also called media specialist or information specialist
support instructional programs by responding to request of teachers and students 
In other words trend to develop collection in non electronic libraries tend to be when
That is responsive service 
And by initiating activities for teachers and students which is a proactive service 
Responsive services include maintaining reserve materials, answering reference questions,
providing bibliographic instruction, developing media packages, recommending books of films
and teaching users how to use materials 
Proactive services include selective dissemination of information to faculty and students initiating
thematic events, collaborating with instructor to plan instruction and introducing new instructional
methods and tools 
In these ways, libraries save to allow instructors and students to share expensive materials
and expertise 
needed 
Second, libraries serve a cultural role in preserving and organizing artifacts and ideas 
Great works of literature, art and science must be preserved and made accessible to future
learners, although libraries have traditionally been viewed as facilities for printed artifacts 
Primary and secondary school libraries often also serve as museums and laboratories 
Libraries preserve objects through CAF storage procedures, policies of borrowing and use,
and repair and maintenance as needed 
In addition to preservation, libraries ensure access to materials through indexes, catalogues
and other finding aids that allow learners to locate items appropriate to their needs 
Third, libraries serve social and intellectual roles in bringing together people and ideas 
This is distinct from the practical role of sharing resources in that libraries provide
But because of resource recall possibility from remote access, future tendency of collection
a physical place for teachers and learners to meet outside the structure of the classroom 
Thus, allowing people with different perspectives, to interact in a knowledge space that is both
larger and more general than that shared by any single discipline or affinity group 
Browsing a catalogue in a library provides a global view for people engaged in specialized
study and offers opportunities for insights or alternative views 
In many respects, libraries serve as condense of inter disciplinary 
Places shared by learners from all disciplines 
Digital libraries extend such inter disciplinary by making diverse information resources available
beyond the physical space shared by groups of learners 
One of the greatest benefits of digital libraries is bringing together people with formal, informal
development will be directed to be just in time 
and professional learning missions 
Formal learning is systematic and guided by instructions 
Formal learning take place in courses offered at schools of various kinds and in training
courses, or programs on the job 
The important roles that libraries serve in formal learning are illustrated by their physical
prominence on university campuses and the number of courses that make direct use of
library services and materials 
Most of the information resources in schools are tied directly to the instructional mission 
Students or teachers who wish to find information outside this mission have in the past had
to travel to other libraries 
This orientation emphasis on immediate and satisfying response to users queries 
By making the broad range of information resources discussed below available to students and
teachers in schools, digital libraries open new learning opportunities for global rather
than strictly local communities 
Much learning in life is informal or opportunistic and strictly under the control of the learners 
Learners take advantage of other people, mass media and the immediate environment during
informal learning 
Public libraries provide classic non-fiction books, a wide range of periodicals, reference
resources and audio and video tapes, so that patterns can learn about topics of their own
choosing at their own place and style 
Just as computing technology and worldwide telecommunication networks are beginning to
Although both of when needed and just in time trends are equally important, but according
change what is possible in formal classrooms, they are changing how individuals pursue personal
learning missions 
Professional learning refers to the ongoing learning adults engage into do their work
and to improve their work related knowledge and skills 
In fact, for many professionals, learning is the central aspect of their work 
Like informal learning that is mainly self directed, but unlike formal or informal learning,
it is focused on a specific field closely linked to job performance, aims to be comprehensive
and is acquired and applied longitudinally 
Since professional learning effects job performance, co-operations and government agencies support
libraries often called information centers with information resources specific to the
to collection development policy for libraries must be decided to manage and balance between
goals of the organization 
The main information resources for professional learning however are personal collections
of books, reports and files, subscription to journals and the human networks of colleagues
nurtured through professional meetings and various communications 
Many of the datasets and computational tools of digital libraries were originally developed
to enhance professional learning 
Digital library initiatives in India - India is in the experimental stages of digital libraries 
A majority of libraries provide bibliographic access only 
The health education library for people help Mumbai, The Dera Institute of Fundamental
Research, DIFR Mumbai, IIT Kharagpur and National Centre for Science Information NCSI Bangalore

These libraries consist of a collection of digital resources that may have existed only
are some exceptions 
IASLIC list and the list forum along with the electronic newsletter InfoWatch provide
professional information 
Information today and tomorrow, INFLIBNET newsletter and the DESIDOCK bulletin of information
technology The Bit are a few other sources of current information on the use of ICTs
and networks in India 
Research and developmental activities regarding digital libraries are being undertaken in
some institutions for example, the Indian National Scientific Documentation Centre,
NISCAIR New Delhi

Digital archives 
Archives differ from libraries in several ways 
Traditionally archives were defined as containing primary sources of information typically letters
be stored in networked computers 
and papers directly produced by an individual or organization rather than the secondary
sources found in a library, like books, papers, journals and so on 
Having their contents organized in groups rather than individual items, whereas books
in a library are catalogued individually, items in an archive are typically grouped
by provinces the individual or organizations who created them, an original order, the order
in which the materials were kept by the creator 
Having unique contents, whereas a book may be found at many different libraries depending
on its rarity the records in an archive are usually one of a kind and cannot be found
or consulted at any other location except at the archive that hold them 
The technology used to create digital libraries has been even more revolutionary for the archives 
Maybe it seems that to meet urgent needs of users, accessibility is more important than
Since it breaks down the second and third of these general rules 
The use of search engines, optical character recognition and metadata allow digital copies
of individual items such as letters to be catalogued and the ability to remotely access
digital copies has removed the necessity of physically going to a particular archive to
find a particular set of records 
The Oxford text archive is generally considered to be the oldest digital archive of academic
primary source materials 
A digital library is a collection of documents in organized electronic form available on
the internet or on CD Rom 
Depending on the specific library, a user maybe able to access magazine, articles, books,
ownership, but it is not true 
papers, images, sound files and videos 
Some institutions have begun the task of converting classic books to electronic format for distribution
on the internet 
Some files can be viewed directly in HTML format, other can be downloaded in PDF format
and printed 
The new generation is fond of digital media than books and hard copies 
Hence the E-Library or the digital library provides better experience in seeking knowledge 
Hence in this module, we have discussed some of the important characteristics of E-Library 
Hope you enjoyed this session 
See you next time, until then, bye 
Ownership and accessibility are complementary of each other 
If a library just notice to accessibility and forgets ownership, it will remain only
as a network 
In this manner, resources will be exclusive to publishers and the library will change
to be lifeless and ghostly systems with some old and out of date resources 
in digital form or have been converted from another form to digital 
Also reading electronic resources are without enough qualification and enjoyable sense of
reading printing resources for some of readers, especially in field of literature and history 
Including printed and digital resources in a same time, library could serve to clients
with different interest 
Separation versus coordination - Digital library users do not need to have physical attending
in library to earn information 
Most of the time, library provides valid information access more than merely circulation of materials 
In addition to collection of data, the library by organizing resources in networks directly
or indirectly
make collection accessible for users It can be said, it is vital for libraries to collect and organize digital works virtually
These resources are generally stored in a broad range of formats and can be accessed
through networked communication 
It cost for example, cataloging and document delivery services come closer to expanding
collection more than before 
Therefore gaps have been reduced between technical services and public services to users and
at the end it is not out of mind to integrate each other 
Acceleration of information circulations - In networks, every author is publisher too 
Information circulates in the moment of time, creating and sharing information become more
faster than preceding 
This high speed of information circulation has challenges for libraries 
Because of that they must have new strategically planning view to collection via internet 
by users over a computer network 
Five concepts of electronically digital library system – Digital- An electronic library
has not only text data but also sound, graphics and motion video in the form of digital data 
Because all data is digitalized, various kinds of data can be merged easily and a high level
of retrieval and other processing can be done 
Network - When electronic libraries of this kind appear in many places and are linked
to each other via a network, a huge virtual library is built on the network 
It is a world library which process national borders regardless of the distances between
actual electronic libraries 
Interactive - The electronic library system provides the latest functions as well as allowing
books to be displayed on screen as if they were printed books 
Such libraries have many advantages in that 
The system makes advances in retrieving books and papers 
The system enables the user to display multiple books on a single screen and skip from one
part describing an idea to a link describing the same idea within an another book 
It enables the user also to reference dictionaries and thesauruses simultaneously to check any unknown
terms, attach notes and tabs to various positions in a book 
Translate original text and output text as voice data 
Multimedia - The user of the electronic library system can use data in different format such
as text, sound, graphics and motion video 
This multimedia data is more understandable than conventional books containing only text,
diagrams and tables 
They can be updated on a daily basis and can be accessed instantly by users 
Scalable - The electronic library system can be used to build an electronic library in
various sizes according to the available hardware, software and data resources 
The electronic library can be as large as a national library and as small as a personal
library 
Advantages of the digital library - A digital library is not confined to a particular location
or so called building 
It is virtually distributed all over the world 
The user can get his or her information on his own computer screen by using the internet 
Actually it’s a network of multimedia system which provides finger tip access 
The spoken words or the graphical display of a digital library is again having a different
Additionally they do not have a physical boundary, can store more information and offer access
impact from the words that are printed 
In the new environment or into a document will not be a problem for the library because
the user will pay for its uses 
No physical boundary 
The user of a digital library need not go to the library physically 
People from all over the world could gain access information as long as an internet
connection is available 
Round the clock availability - Digital libraries can be accessed at any time, twenty four hours
a day and three sixty five days of the year 
Multiple access - The same resources can be used at the same time by a number of users 
to multiple resources simultaneously 
﻿Welcome to the session on Google Scholar   
Scholar allows for you to see articles related to  the one that might interest you, how many times an  
article has been cited and by whom, and provide  citations for articles in a number of styles   
Google Scholar can display links to articles  and books held through ECU libraries   
Google Scholar allows you to save both  citation and articles to read later   
Disadvantages of using Google Scholar -  Google Scholar’s coverage is wide-ranging  
but not comprehensive  It can be a research  source, but should not be the only source  
you use  Google Scholar does not provide the  criteria for what makes its results ‘scholarly’   
Results are often vary in quantity and it is  up to the researcher to determine which of the  
results are suitable for their purposes  Google  Scholar does not allow users to limit results to  
either peer reviewed or full text materials or  by discipline  Google Scholar does not provide  
two thousand four, the Google Scholar  index includes most peer reviewed online  
notice of when its materials are updated   Google Scholar’s citation tracker can be  
difficult to use and inaccurate   Optimizing files for Google Scholar -  
Based on the definition of search engine  optimization for web pages, SEO we define  
academy search engine optimization ASEO as  follows  Academic Search Engine Optimization,  
ASEO, is the creation, publication and  modification of scholarly literature in a way  
that makes it easier for academic search engines  to both crawl it and index it  The basic concept  
of keyword based searching is the same for  all major or academic search engines    
Users search for a search term in a certain  document field  Example title, abstract, body  
text or in all fields and all documents containing  the search term are listed on the results page   
Academic search engines use different  ranking algorithms to determine  
academy journals and books, conference papers,  thesis and dissertation , preprints, abstracts,  
in which position the results are displayed  Some  let the user choose one factor on which to rank,  
there is common ranking factors or publication  date, citation count, author or journal name and  
reputation and relevance of the document   Others combined the ranking factors into  
one algorithm and more often than not, the  user has no influence on the factors weighting   
The relevance of a document  is basically a function of  
how often the search term occurs in that document  and in which part of the document it occurs   
Generally speaking, the more often a search term  occurs in the document and the more important  
the document field is in which that term occurs,  the more relevant the document is considered  This  
means that an occurrence in the title is weighted  more heavily than an occurrence in the abstract,  
which carries more weight than an occurrence in  a subheading than in the body text and so on    
technical reports and others scholarly literature,  including court opinion and patents    
In this session, we will discuss the most  important considerations to help ensure  
your work is visible in Google Scholar  Abstract  and Metadata - Metadata completeness for PDFs and  
other electronic files is particularly important   It provides extra context for the search engine,  
indicating what your document is about and  how it relates to other articles  Essential  
elements of metadata for academic work are  Title, Author names, Abstract, Keywords,  
author and user related, Publication name, Social  annotations, Description, File name, and URI    
Google's algorithm will look for keywords and  phrases used in the main body of the article,  
as well as tables, figures, and sub headings  to identify the most relevant articles for  
users searched, but taking the time to include  carefully considered metadata makes it that  
bit easier for Google Scholar to get your article  in front of people searching on that topic   
While Google does not publish the size of  Google Scholars database, scientometric,  
The abstract is also really important  because Google Scholar uses it to form the  
meta description  Just as a researcher will decide  whether to delve into a full academic paper based  
on the abstract, the meta description is your  opportunity to encourage readers to click through  
from the search results in the first place   Google's meta descriptions can be up to two  
thirty characters long  This means that while the  full abstract can of course be as long as needed  
its worth considering how the first two thirty  characters will look in the meta description  
and how effectively this description will draw in  readers  We recommend putting the most important  
information first summing up the contents of words  and what the user will gain from reading it    
Types of Graphics - Images in  articles should be vector graphics,  
which are made up of straight and curved lines,  rather than raster, which are made up of pixels   
researchers, estimated it to contain roughly  three eighty nine million documents including  
The reason for using vector over raster graphics  is that text cannot be read by search engines,  
if it is housed in a raster format  This  means any text included in the raster graphic  
won't do anything to help the article rank  more prominently in the Google Scholar results  
and ideally you want every bit of your article  to contribute relevance for the different search  
queries that might lead a person to your work  The  following formats are examples of vector graphics  
dot svg, dot ai, dot eps and dot ps   Citation Details and Count - As mentioned,  
your citations are very important for helping  articles to rank well in Google Scholar  To ensure  
Google Scholar can understand the relation between  your articles and the work cited within them   
You should ensure author names and publication  names are always cited in the exact same way and  
that the reference list for the full article is  labeled with a clear subheading  You should also  
articles, citations and patents, making it  the world's largest academic search engine  
ensure the formatting of author and publication  information is aligned across the article  
itself and in the metadata of the file  All this  maximizes the potential for your papers to rank  
prominently when people search for academic  work using author and publication names    
In this module, Google Scholar  and its characteristics are  
discussed in detail  This module gives an account  of the fundamental concepts in Google Scholar  
ranking algorithm  We also discussed various  advantages and limitations of Google Scholar  
in detail  The module ends by referring  various techniques to optimize a search  
in January, two thousand eighteen  Previously, the  size was estimated at one sixty million documents  
as of May, two thousand fourteen   Earlier statistical estimate published  
in, PLOS One, which is a peer  reviewed open access journal,  
using a mark and recapture method estimated  approximately eighty to ninety percentage  
We have already seen that the advancements  in information technology has a great impact  
coverage of all articles published in  English, with an estimate of hundred million   
This estimate also determined how many  documents were freely available on the web    
Google Scholar is similar in function to the  freely available CiteSeerx and getCITED  It also  
resembles the subscription based tools ELSEVIER  Scopus and Clarivate Analytics, Web of Science   
Google Scholar has been criticized for  not weighting journals and including  
predatory journals in its index   Useful Features and Specifications - Google  
Scholar combines some features to make it easy  to identify a range of related publications  
across a topic area and extract citations  in many standard styles and formats    
Related Articles - If you find a useful article,  
you can click the related articles link to  see more like it  It's important to not,  
on every phase of research  There are  different applications and facilities  
however, that Google Scholar does not clarify what  algorithm it uses to determine related articles   
Cited By - Clicking the Cited By link, lets  you see where an article has been cited  This  
is a helpful tool for uncovering more potentially  relevant journal articles or other documents    
Citation Formatting - To see the citation  formatted in MLA, APA, Chicago, Harvard and  
Vancouver styles, simply click on the quote icon   You can then copy and paste the citation into your  
document or export it to your bibliography  manager  Relevant Research - Google Scholar  
lets you follow research that is related to a  specific author’s work, to do so, click follow  
on the authors public profile page and then select  new articles related to this author's research   
Whenever an article is published related to the  author's work, you will get an email alert    
Google Scholar allows users to search for digital  or physical copies of articles, whether online  
to help researchers in the process of  data collection and analysis of data    
or in libraries  It indexes full text journal  articles, technical reports, preprints, thesis,  
books and other documents including selected  web pages that are deemed to be scholarly   
Because many of Google Scholar search results link  to commercial journal articles, most people will  
be able to access only an abstract and the  citation details of an article and have to  
pay a fee to access the entire article  The most  relevant results for the search keyword will be  
listed first in order of the authors ranking   The number of references that are linked to it and  
they relevance to other scholarly literature  and the ranking of the publication that the  
journal appears in  Using its group of feature  it shows the available links to journal articles   
In the two thousand five version  this feature provided a link to both  
subscription access version of an article  and to free full text version of articles,  
Some applications are helpful in data collection,  while others are used for analysis and some others  
for most of two thousand six, it provided  links to only the publishers versions    
Since December two thousand six, it has provided  links to both published versions and major open  
access repositories, but still does not cover  those posted on individual faculty web pages,  
access to such self archiving non-subscription  versions is now provided by a link to Google,  
where one can find such open access articles   With it cited by feature Google Scholar provides  
access to abstracts of articles that  have cited the article being viewed   
It is this feature in particular that provides  the citation indexing previously only found in  
ELSEVIER, Scopus and Web of Science   With its ‘Related articles’ feature,  
Google Scholar presents a list of closely related  articles, ranked primarily by how similar these  
articles are to the original result but also  taking into account the relevance of each paper   
are used at the time of publishing  Google Scholar  is one such type of facility, which is a search  
Google Scholar’s legal database  of US cases is extensive,  
users can search and read published opinions  of US state appellate, and Supreme Court cases,  
since nineteen fifty, US Federal District  appellate, tax and bankruptcy records since  
nineteen twenty three, and the US Supreme  Court cases, since nineteen seventy one    
Google Scholar embeds clickable citation links  within the case and the house cited tab allows  
lawyers to research prior case law and the  subsequent citations to the court decision   
The Google Scholar legal content  Star Paginator extension inserts  
Westlaw, and LexisNexis style page numbers  in line with the text of the case    
The Ranking Algorithm - Link analysis is an  important tool used by web search engines,  
while it also plays a part in the study of  citations among scientific papers and journals   
engine that covers scholarly literature,  including peer reviewed papers, thesis,  
The standard measure of citation impact factor  is the average number of citations, received by  
a paper in the given journal over the past two  years  Here, the average attention paid by the  
academic community to papers published in the  journal serves the role of voting by in links   
Google Scholar however combines the  traits of web search engine and citation  
analysis and is different from both   Google's ranking function for web search  
is believed to involve PageRank, as well as  non-PageRank methods developed on hubs and  
authorities, while Google Scholar, like citation  analysis deals with journal articles that have  
with no in-links, or out-links, rather than  webs  Citation play the same role in links play  
in-link analysis and do so in a more explicit  way, they directly show what other articles have  
influenced one article and citation  counts can be easily used to show how  
books, abstracts and technical reports   Google Scholar - Google Scholar is a freely  
many times one article has been endorsed   As a research by Bill and Gibb found out the  
citation counts of an article is the highest  ranking factor in the ranking of articles in  
Google Scholar  Also, the occurrence of a search  term in an article’s title has a strong impact on  
the articles ranking  While the impact of search  term frequencies in an articles full text is weak   
On the other hand, Google Scholar does not seem  to use the principles of repeated improvement as  
citations from high impact journals are count in  the same way as citation from low impact ones    
In the same way as web page authors would  try to understand ranking functions of  
web search engine to make their pages  rank higher, scholars may also utilize  
knowledge of the ranking algorithm of Google  Scholar to make their article appear the first   
And since the factors in ranking algorithm of  Google Scholar are more controllable than those  
accessible web search engine that indexes the  full text or metadata of scholarly literature,  
in normal web search, scholars may do so,  simply by using relevant words in the title  
as much as possible and increase self  citation or citation alliances    
On the other hand, the reliability of Google  Scholar as an information source is still debated  
and researchers would use the  same knowledge to determine  
the usefulness of articles found on  Google Scholar  Thus, there will be  
a balance in the end between cost and benefits  of making paper rank higher on Google Scholar   
Advantages and Limitations of Google Scholar  - Advantages of using Google Scholar-  
Google Scholar is familiar and relatively  simple to use, much like Google    
Google Scholar allows users to search for a find  a wide variety of materials, including articles,  
books, “grey literature” like conference  proceedings on a vast number of topics  Google  
across an array of publishing formats and  disciplines  Released in beta in November  
Hello, welcome to today’s session IT Fundamentals  SPSS,
You could then ask them to hold a hot corn and, again, measure the perception of pain 
Imagine I was a participant, I would have a single row representing my data 
So there would be different column for my name, my gender, my pain perception for cold
water and my pain perception for a hot corn 
Reshma, Female, seven, ten, the Data Editor is made up of lots of cells, which are boxes,
in which data values can be placed 
When a cell is active, it becomes highlighted in orange 
To enter a number into the Data Editor simply move to the cell in which you want to place
the data value, type the value, then press the appropriate row button for the direction
in which you wish to move 
These data may come from basically any source, scientific research, a customer database,
The Variables View - Before we input any data into the Data Editor, we need to create the
variables 
To create variables we use the Variable view of the Data Editor 
To access this view, click on the Variable view tab at the bottom of the Data Editor 
The contents of the window will change as shown in the figure 
The SPSS Viewer - Alongside the SPSS Data Editor window, there was a second window known
as the SPSS viewer, the SPSS viewer displays all of the output from SPSS like analysis
results, graph, error messages, etcetera 
The following figure shows the basic layout of the viewer window 
On the right hand side there is a large space in which the output is displayed, the SPSS
Google Analytics, or even the server log files of the website 
displays both graphs and the results of statistical analysis in this part of the viewer 
It is also possible to edit a graph or table by double clicking on it 
There is a tree diagram on the left hand side of the viewer that displays the structure
of the output 
This tree diagram provides an easy way of accessing specific parts of the output which
is useful when you have conducted several analyses, the tree structure is fairly self
explanatory 
Every time you do something in SPSS, such as drawing a graph, or running a statistical
procedure, it lists this procedure as a main heading 
If you want to share your SPSS output with other people you don't have SPSS statistics
SPSS can open all file formats that are commonly used for structured data such as spreadsheets
installed, you have two choices, export the output into a software package that they do
have such as Microsoft Word or any Portable Document Format PDF 
The syntax Editor - SPSS syntax is the language of commands for carrying out statistical analysis
and data manipulations 
Most of the time you will do the things you need to use using SPSS dialog boxes, but SPSS
syntax can be useful 
For one thing, there are certain things you can do with syntax that you can't do through
dialog boxes 
The second reason for using syntax is if you often carry out very similar analysis on data sets 
In these situations, it is often quicker to do the analysis and save the syntax, as you
go along 
The syntax window has a navigation area, rather like the viewer window 
When you have a larger file of syntax command this navigation area can be helpful for negotiating
your way to the bit of syntax that you actually need 
Once you've typed in your syntax, you have to turn it using the run menu or syntax window
top under syntax window with some syntax in its bottom is given in the figure 
Saving and Retrieving File - When attempting to save files from the SPSS software, it is
important to first remember that the only information that is saved is what it in the
current windows 
For example, if the currently displayed window contains the output from an analysis, the
The SPSS model - SPSS has similarities to both spreadsheet applications and databases 
only information that will be contained in the resulting file is the output 
The information from the Data Editor will not be saved 
In order to save the information from the Data Editor, it must be active window by selecting
the window at the top of the screen and then selecting the Data Editor 
Once the Data Editor has been made, the active window, it can be saved as well 
After selecting Save or Save As, the Save dialog box will appear 
The name of the data file can be entered in the box labeled file name and the directory
in which the file is saved can be changed by selecting the down arrow on the right side
of the box labeled Save In 
You can save data in formats, other than SPSS, three of the most useful are Microsoft Excel
SPSS requires you to create a database and then perform statistical manipulations with
files xls, xlsx, comma separated values csv and tab delimited text dat 
Navigate to wherever you save the files and open it 
Well, now let us summarize the session 
SPSS is a window based program that can be used to perform data entry and analysis and
to create tables and graphs 
In this module, the basic concepts of SPSS software is introduced, this module gives
an account of the SPSS model and various windows in it 
The module also explains the Data Editor, the SPSS viewer and the syntax editor in detail 
Saving, and retrieving of SPSS files are also discussed in the last session 
the data 
Thank you for watching today's program 
Hope the session was enriching 
Goodbye 
The key difference between SPSS and these other applications is SPSS is designed for
statistical analysis 
Thus, it has far better and more efficient statistical capabilities than most spreadsheet
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 
and database applications 
Analyzing data with SPSS is relatively easy 
You will need to complete several steps to perform your analysis 
Get your data into SPSS, you can open a previously saved SPSS data file, read a spreadsheet,
de base or text data file or enter your data directly in the Data Editor 
Select a procedure from the menus to calculate statistics or create a charts 
You can select a procedure to perform statistical analysis or select a procedure to create high
resolution charts 
Select the variables you want to use in the analysis 
The variables in the data file are displayed in a dialog box for the procedure, run the
It's a versatile and responsive program designed to undertake a range of statistical procedures 
procedure and look at the results 
Windows in SPSS - There are four main windows in SPSS and it would be useful to introduce
you to what the four windows in SPSS are and what each is used for 
First one, Data View - The Data View is used to store and show your data 
It is much like an ordinary spreadsheet although in general, the data is structured so that
rows are cases and the columns are for the different variables that relate to each case 
Second one, Variable view - The Variable view contains the variables on your data set so
it defines the properties of your data set 
Each row will define all of the various variables for one set of data 
For example, for a numerical piece of data this would show amongst other things the number
SPSS is a Windows based program that can be used to perform data entry and analysis and
of decimal places that are stored for that piece of data 
measure 
Ensuring that the measure of your variables is correct is vital 
The variable can be nominal which is for strings of data, ordinal for data that is in continuous
but can be ranked or ordered or finally scale which is used for a variable that is continuous
for example, a distance to somewhere 
Third one, Output Viewer Window - This window is used to show the results that have been
output from your data analysis 
Depending on your analysis that are carrying out this may include the chart editor window
to create tables and graphs 
or pivot table window 
Fourth one, Syntax Editor Window - This window shows the underlying commands that have executed
your data analysis 
If you are a confident coder this is where you can amend the code or write your own from
scratch and then run your own custom analysis of your data set 
Getting Started - SPSS mainly uses two windows, the Data Editor, this is where you input your
data and carry out statistical functions and the viewer, this is where the result of any
analysis appear 
There are several additional windows that can be activated such as the syntax editor,
which allows you to end a SPSS commands manually, rather than using the window based menus 
SPSS capable of handling large amounts of data and can perform all of the analysis covered
For beginners, the syntax window is redundant because you can carry out most analysis by
clicking merrily with your mouse 
However, there are additional functions that can be accessed using syntax and this can
often save you time 
This startup of window of SPSS is given in the figure 
Once SPSS has been activated, a startup window will appear which allows you to select various options 
If you already have a data file on disk that you would like to open then select open an
existing data source 
The Data Editor - The main SPSS window includes the Data Editor for entering data 
This window is where most of the action happens 
here and much more 
At the top of the screen is a menu bar similar to the ones you might have seen in other programs 
Following shows this menu bar and the Data Editor 
There are several menus at the top of the screen that can be activated by using the
computer mouse to move the on screen arrow on to the desired menu and then pressing the
left mouse button once 
When you have clicked on a menu, a menu box will appear that displays a list of options
that can be activated by moving the onscreen arrow so that it is pointing at the desired
option and then clicking with the mouse 
Often, selecting an option from a menu makes a window appear 
These windows are referred to as dialog boxes 
SPSS is commonly used in the Social Sciences and in the business world 
The Data Editor has two views, the Data View and the Variable view 
The Data View is for entering data and the Variable view is for defining characteristics
of the variables within the Data Editor 
Notice at the bottom of the Data Editor that there are two tabs labeled Data View and Variable
view, all we do to switch between these two views is to click on these tabs the highlighted
tabs, tell you which view you are in although, it will be obvious 
Let's look at some general features of the Data Editor features that don't change when
we switch between the Data View, and the Variable view 
Entering data into the Data Editor - When you first load SPSS, it will provide a blank
Data Editor with the title, Untitled one, when you input, a new set of data, you must
So, familiarity with this program should serve you well in the future 
input your data in a logical way, the SPSS Data Editor is arranged, such that each row
represents the data from one entity, while each column represents a variable 
There is no discrimination between independent and dependent variables 
Both types should be placed in a separate column 
The key point is that each row represents one entities data 
Therefore, any information about that case should be entered across the Data Editor 
For example, imagine you were interested in six differences in perceptions of pain created
by hot and cold stimuli 
You could place some people's hands in a bucket of very cold water for a minute and asked
them to rate how painful they thought the experience was on a scale of one to ten 
SPSS is updated often, SPSS is software for editing and analyzing all sorts of data 
Welcome to the session on Mathematica 
For example, to change the default values of fonts, you would choose formatting options
slash fonts after selecting Preferences  Other useful editing commands are available in the
Input menu Copy Input from Above and Copy Output from Above 
The Mathematica Kernel - It is helpful to understand that the Mathematica program consists
of two parts, the user interface and the kernel  The user interface simplifies the process
of entering Mathematical equations and translates the output into easier to read symbols, the
kernel is the part of Mathematica that performs computations  When you start a Mathematica
session only the user interface is running, the kernel will be launched the first time
you ask Mathematica to evaluate an input cell  Consequently it usually takes Mathematica
sometime to complete the first evaluation, since the kernel must be started before the
practical tool for large scale numerical calculations 
evaluation can occur 
After the kernel is launched all further cell evaluations will be faster, since the kernel
is already started  The kernel remembers each evaluation it has performed and the order
in which these were performed  This ordering is indicated by the sequential numbering that
Mathematica assigns to each evaluated input and the resulting output, this ordering can
be important if you have used the same variable names to designate different calculations 
Occasionally you may have performed an evaluation earlier that is interfering with a subsequent
evaluation, when this happens it is sometimes helpful to use the quit kernel command from
the kernel menu and to restart the evaluation process  You can then either use the start
kernel command also on the kernel menu or just select a cell to evaluate and then type
Its applications can range from simple calculations to complicated programs and Mathematica can
shift and enter, which will launch the kernel, when you have quit kernel and then started
again you will need to evaluate cells as if they have not been previously evaluated 
Plotting - The basic command to plot functions is Plot of f of x comma within the brackets
x, a, b where a, b is the range of values you want to display on the x axis  Mathematica
will plot symbolic functions for this reason Mathematica can be used to quickly provide
information on the shape of a function, this is very useful for quickly viewing whether
the equation you derived in your homework solution is reasonable  It is often convenient
to name plots example, p equal to plot of f of x x, a, b gives this plot the name p
one, then later you can use the show command example show p one, p two, p three etcetera
where plots p two and p three have been defined by similar commands to show several plots
be a powerful tool for quantitative geoscientists such as geologists, geographers, geophysicists,
on the same axis 
Also this allows the user to redefine plotting options example, the axis length, titles etcetera
without retyping the plot command, several options can be used with plot or show are
is false  AxesLabel with x axis label, y axis label, labels the axis of a plot, the default
is no axes labels  FrameLabels to bottom x axis label, left y axis label, top label,
right secondary y axis label, labels the frame of a plot, the default is no frame labels 
The last two can just be left out if they are not needed  PlotLabel to name places a
name above the plot, the default is no plot title  PlotRange to y minimum, y maximum changes
the range of y axis  PlotStyle to Curve one Style, Curve two Style etcetera changes the
hydrologists and oceanographers because it’s a general mathematics system rather than a
line styles of curves 
An example is PlotStyle to Thickness of zero point zero two, GrayLevel point zero five,
Dashing point zero five for a thick gray, dashed line this command needs to be used
with the plot command  Equations - To define an equation use two equal signs that is left
hand side double equal to right hand side, equations are not functions, they are equations
you must be interested in solving, that is finding the values of one or more of the variables
to satisfy the equality 
Analytical Solutions or Symbolic Function Generated - The command solve will find exact
solutions to linear systems of equations  The command is Solve equation one of x, y double
equal to equation two of x, y comma equation three x, y double equal to equation four of
task specific application, however its utility may not be apparent at first glance  It does
x, y comma x, y where the equations are functions of x and y  Notice that the brackets are needed
around the equations to be solved because there are more than one 
Numerical Solutions Number Value Generated  The main commands to solve equations numerically
are NRoots of polynomial one x double equal to polynomial one of x comma x will find the
roots of a polynomial, even if there are more than one root  FindRoot of equation x comma
x initial guess will work for all equations written in the form that equation of x equals
zero note that the zero is not included in the command provided that the initial guess
is good enough, good enough means that FindRoot works not good enough means that FindRoot
does not work and you must try to make a better initial guess 
In choosing an initial guess it is often useful to examine a plot of the function when only
not after all solve specific geo scientific problems any more than do programming language
one initial guess is given FindRoot uses Newton's method, if you give a low and high range to
the initial guess that is FindRoot of equation x comma x log <?></?>* FindRoot will use the
second method instead of Newton’s method  Usually the second method is more stable than
Newton's method that is the second method may be less sensitive to poor initial guesses 
Programming in Mathematica - A program or code is a sequence of instructions to solve
some problem, in Mathematica we input each instruction and press the return key, after
all instructions are typed in we press the enter key to execute the sequence  Individual
instructions in the code can be assignment statements, iteration statements or loops
conditional like if, input or output statements, functions or other programming constricts 
Looping Constructs or Iteration - Allow repeated evaluation of expressions, functions do, for
such as C or Fortran or spreadsheet programs 
and while are similar to looping statements in high level programming languages  Do function
has general forms Do body within brackets k, kstart, kstop, dk evaluates body repeatedly
values are one 
For Function - Has the general form for initial, test, increment, body  First the initial statements
are processed then the test condition is evaluated if test is true the body is processed, then
increment is processed, the sequence test, body, increment is repeatedly processed until
test is false  While Function - Has the general form- While test, body where body is a set
of statements that are repeatedly processed until test is evaluated to be false 
Conditionals or Decision Statements - High level programming languages generally make
Over the years we have encountered many geo scientists who know that Mathematica exists
decisions as to which processing steps should be executed next using an if structure but
some languages provide other conditionals as well  Mathematica provide the functions
if, which and switch for decision making  If function - If test, true statements, false
statements, if the test is true the true statements are executed, if the test is false the false
statements are executed 
Which Function? Which test one, value one, test two, value two, etcetera  Returns the
first value k associated with the first true test k as tester evaluated left to right 
Switch Function - Switch expression, form one, value one, form two, value two etcetera,
default  Evaluates expression and compares it to each form k in left to right order and
returns the corresponding value k when a match is found  The underscore above is an optional
but are not sure what it does with regard to the specific problems they face in their
default form matches anything 
Functional Programming - Functional programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building
the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation
of Mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data  It is a declarative
programming paradigm which means programming is done with expressions  In functional code
the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are input to the function 
So, calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x will produce the same
result f of x each time 
Eliminating side effects that is changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs
can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program which is
research or professional practice, the short answer is that it does nothing geo scientific
Mathematica is a symbolic Mathematical computation program
one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming treats computation
as the evaluation of Mathematical functions  Avoids changing state - Output value of a
function depends only on the arguments  Eliminating side effects can make it much easier to predict
the behavior of a program 
In this module Mathematica computing system and its characteristics are discussed in detail,
this module gives an account of the basic syntax of Mathematica and the basic rules
for its syntax  The fundamental concepts Mathematica kernel is discussed followed by plotting and
equation techniques, we also discussed various programming constricts used in the system
and briefly introduced the concept of functional programming in Mathematica  Hope you enjoy
this session, see you next time, until then, bye 
in particular but has the potential to do just about anything that a user can imagine 
Computational Geosciences with Mathematica is intended to help fill that gap by illustrating
how Mathematica can be used to formulate, solve and visualize a variety of problems
of interest to geoscientists  The functionality of Mathematica which includes many standard
packages with specialized functions in areas such as statistics and graphics can be expanded
with packages available through Wolfram Research other commercial sources or the public domain 
Packages that may be of interest to geoscientists but which are not covered here include a database
access kit, digital image processing, experimental data analysis, real-time 3D graphics, facility,
neural networks, signal processing, time series analysis and wavelets  Those who are interested
in those packages can contact Wolfram research for more information about their capabilities
sometimes called a computer algebra program used in many scientific engineering, Mathematical
and availability 
Basic Syntax - Symbols plus, minus, hyphen, exponential, star are all supported by Mathematica 
Multiplication can be represented by a space between variables a x plus b and a star x
plus b are identical  On the other hand ax plus b without a space between a and x denotes
the sum of two variables, one named ax and the other b 
Warning Mathematica is case sensitive, for example the command to exit is quit and not
QUIT or capital QUIT  Square brackets are used around function arguments  Write Sin
of within square brackets x not Sin within simple brackets x or Sin within curly braces x 
Parenthesis or simple brackets group terms for math operations, as in within brackets
Psi of x plus Cos of y star Tan of z plus z exponent two 
and computing fields  It was conceived by Stephen Wolfram and is developed by Wolfram
If you end an expression with a semicolon it will be executed but its output will not
be shown this is useful for simulations  Braces are used for list, that is A can have the
form within curly braces eighty one, two, three which outputs within the set eighty
one, two, three  Names can refer to variables, expressions, functions, matrices, graphs etcetera 
A name is assigned using name equal to object 
An expression may contain undefined names for example, A equal to within brackets a
plus b exponent three, the output will be a plus b whole cube and A exponent two will
be a plus b whole raised to six  The percent sign or percentage symbol reproduces the value
of the previous results for example, five plus three the output will be eight and percentage
exponent two will give eight to the power two which is sixty four 
Research of Champagne, Illinois 
Basic Rules of Mathematica Syntax - The arguments of functions are given in brackets parenthesis
are used for grouping operations; vectors, matrices and lists are given in braces and
double square brackets are used for indexing list and tables  Mathematica is case sensitive 
Thus, cos of x is not the same as capital Cos of x and be careful  Mathematica has several
built-in functions example cos of x, sin of x, exponent of x etcetera 
The first letter of built-in functions always have the first letter capitalized and if a
name consists of two or more words the first letter of each word is capitalized and there
will be no spaces between the words for example, Laplace Transform of x, the palette basic
input dot nb contains symbols for common Mathematical manipulations like integration, differentiation,
summation, division and exponentiation 
The Wolfram language is the programming language used in Mathematica  Hence it is a system
Greek symbols are also included in this notebook, the basic input dot nb palette is usually
open when Mathematica is started however it is sometimes hidden behind the open notebook,
if it is open and hidden it can be found through the window menu  The top of the window menu
lists commands for organizing the window, the bottom of the window menu lists all windows
that are currently active, you may see untitled one dot nb messages in addition to basic input
dot nb  If basic input dot nb appears select it and the palette should appear, if it is
not listed then it can be opened from the palettes command in the file menu 
Note that there are other palettes available in addition to basic input dot nb that you
may find useful as well  The Mathematical and Greek symbols in BasicInput dot nb can
be selected by clicking on the chosen symbol and then selecting each of the empty boxes
of computer programs for performing Mathematical operations such as symbolic manipulation,
and filling them in similar to the procedures used in equation editor of a word processor 
Mathematica understands the Greek letter pi to be pi that is three point one four one
five, etcetera  Mathematical manipulations can also be input through a set of standardized
notation, multiplication is represented by either a space or star 
In Mathematica a space b means a star b but ab means you have a new variable with the
name ab  Powers are denoted by a exponent or by using the symbolic representation in
basic input dot nb, remember that Mathematica is case sensitive, a variable named AB is
not same as variable named small letters ab, if you get no response example, Mathematica
seems to be in an infinite loop or an incorrect response you may have entered or executed
the command incorrectly, you can stop execution of a command by clicking interrupt evaluation
numerical calculations, graphics and programming  Mathematica is sometimes described as a computer
under the kernel menu 
If you want the output from an evaluated function to be displayed as a numerical value example,
in decimal format rather than as a symbol or fraction, use the command N and the brackets 
For example, N of Pi will return three point one four one five nine and N of Pi comma twenty
five will return the number Pi to twenty five digits  Typing double slash N after the input
line will achieve the same results example, Pi double slash N returns three point one
four one five nine  If you wish to perform an operation on the last output that Mathematica
produced you can use the symbol percentage  For example, n of percentage will result in
the decimal representation of the last output, for example, input and then evaluate pi, Mathematica
will respond with p 
algebra system probably in difference to the strong symbolic but somewhat limited numerical
Now, type n of percentage, Mathematica will respond with three point one four one five
you can also refer to specific output using output number here or percentage output number
where output number is the number Mathematica has assigned to the cell when it was evaluated 
For example, to generate the numerical value of the output designated as out of seventeen
the command is n of percentage seventeen or n of out of seventeen  Keep in mind that a
specific output number will change if you re-evaluate an input line 
To delete a cell select the right bracket designated the cell and select the clear command
from the edit menu, other useful editing commands can be found in the edit menu, including cut,
copy, copy as and paste  Notice that the preferences command appears in the edit menu, you can
use the preferences command to set default preferences for various Mathematica operations 
capabilities of its earliest versions, but it has evolved into system that is now a very
MUSIC
The pluralism is very important for the
credibility of the Commission  For instance, their society
comprises of a number of sections and the commission
should represent this wide class section of the society
and in order to enable marginalized sections, vulnerable sections
and everyone to approach it freely for redress
whenever there are serious to human rights violations,
quite often, it could be the case that
it could be predominantly a male body
with no sufficient representation for women members 
and promotion of human rights 
It could also be the case that the representation in the IS level
would not be doing enough justice to the
religious, linguistic, ethnic minorities or persons with
disabilities or a persons from other vulnerable sections of the population 
It's very important to ensure
that this body maintains
pluralism and it is a representative of the society
and so that there is a high level of credibility 
Let's come to the fifth principle
NHRC's should have adequate resources 
At a third level, we have
As I said earlier on the commission's have a range of
functions which includes complaint redressal, which
includes promotional functions, in order to carry out all these
activities, it should have wide resources 
By nature, these NHRC's are
like watchdogs and they check our set limits on the state action
whenever it is encroaches on the individuals liberties 
While performing these functions, it is entirely
possible that it could trade on the government's stores
And the government of the day,
institutions which are known as National Human Rights institutions 
which is not happy with this fault finding
or naming by the Human Rights Commission could
adversely reduce its budget  There have been many examples in
the contemporary history where a NHRC has taken an independent
stand, asserted independence is only to find that its manpower
has been suddenly reduced drastically, or its budget has
been slashed disproportionately within the Asian context there
have been, I do not wish to name the countries, but that's why
it's extremely important to
mention in the found 
whose mandate is mentioned in a either statute or
in a constitution of a country
and there are different types 
In fact, in some countries, they can only do research and
have a promotional role as in Germany and France,
on some other European countries  In some other countries, there are equal
opportunities Commission's which can look at employment equity
Dear Students, Welcome to MOOC on Human Rights In India 
like in Canada or Hong Kong  There are some NHRI's, which
have a wider mandate, which can look at the entire gamut of
civil political as well as economic social, cultural rights 
In fact, these range of functions which a NHRI performs,
can be categorized under too broad it's protection
and promotion 
By protection the body receives complaints
and then takes up those complaints with the view
to redress them and which is a and then in addition, it does
monitoring and a number of other functions, which come under the
We are going to consider in this module Paris principles 
category of protection 
There is a promotion aspect,
which is done through spreading, human rights literacy, awareness,
conducting seminars, conferences, sensitization programs
and using such tools to promote human rights 
So, in fact, one has to work on both these legs, that off protection
as well as promotion 
In fact, keeping in view, a wide range of NHRIs
that are available across the world 
A conference was convened by the UN Human Rights Commission
First, let us see, what are NHRI? What are Paris principles?
in the year 1991 at Paris, to discuss the standards that are
required for NHRI 
And that's how Paris principles were
adopted by the UN Human Rights Commission 
And subsequently in the year 1993
the UN General Assembly also adopted these Paris principles 
In fact, they are so cirtical
to the functioning of a National Human Rights Commission 
In fact, it matters a lot for their accreditation 
The extent of complaints of a NHRI
And how are these principles relevant to the work of NHRI's 
with the Paris principles will determine
whether it has a "A" status or a "B" or a "C" status,
which in turn will influence its access to the
Human Rights Council and its mechanisms 
So let us see
these principles in greater detail 
In fact, these Paris principles are basically six in member 
They cover and there are the require
that NHRI's have a broad mandate and also they enjoy autonomy,
independence, pluralism, and that NHRI should be
As you know, at one level we have
vested with adequate resources and adequate investigative powers 
Let us take up each of the six principles
for a in-depth examination  First broad mandate 
As I said earlier on, there are some Commission's which have a
restricted role 
They can look at some aspects of human rights
but not all 
The Paris principles require that
the NHRI should have a wide mandate to look at the entire
gamut of civil political, as well as economic, social cultural rights,
charter based bodies, treaty based bodies
and that it should be explicitly mentioned in its founding statute 
It's very important to not to restrict the
definition of human rights or not to restrict the
scope or the purview of a NHRI and that's why it's very important to
ensure that it has a wide mandate or a broad mandate 
Second, let us take up autonomy: Autonomy is very
important for NHRI the autonomy has several dimensions 
It includes operational autonomy, it includes financial autonomy,
and the NHRI should have this autonomy in order to
be an effective your body because the human rights have been defined
at the United Nations  And another level you have
and it has a task to protect and promote human rights 
And in order to discharge this mandate effectively,
it requires a full functional and operational autonomy 
A third way it requires a independence 
For example, a NHRI's should have
the ability to make its own rules and how it should function 
It should not be the case that for a every decision that it has
to take, it has to take an approval from a another
government department and so, in a way hands of from
the government and it is not dependent on the whims and
regional mechanisms in Europe, America, Africa and also ASEAN,
fancies of any other power and it is able to exercise its independence 
And the way it's a chairperson, members or
commissioners are appointed should also be such that they
cannot be removed easily or the conditions of service cannot be
the salary or other conditions cannot be changed during the
term to the disadvantage  And there are many other such
provisions, which seek to ensure that the NHRI's which are
fully compliant with the Paris principles, enjoy a wide autonomy
as well as independence 
Let's now turn to the fourth principle of pluralism 
where there are institutions at the regional level for Protection
Dear students, welcome to the MOOC on Human Rights In India
in addition there are many other schemes which try to
guarantee some facet or other of human rights,
like LPG subsidy, which is a direct benefit transfer scheme,
a launched by the government a seeks to
it just the affluent sections to give up their LPG subsidy,
so that targeted intervention can be made for the
vulnerable sections 
the executive also has a role to play in terms of
India's commitments under the international human rights conventions 
India has signed or ratified
and the National Human Rights institution 
many core human rights treaties 
They include the treaty dealing with racial discrimination 
They Civil and Political Rights covenant,
economic social cultural rights covenant,
the convention dealing with all
forms of discrimination against women, convention dealing with
rights of the child and convention dealing with the
rights of persons with disabilities 
Each of these, in fact, in some countries, the legislature place a role
in the ratification of international human rights conventions 
In fact, as you know, good governance is intrinsically
In India executive has a an important role to play
in the part of ratification decisions involving
international human rights conventions 
Quite often it involves harmonization of existing domestic legislation,
as per the standards laid down in the multilateral human rights conventions 
Recently,
India, about some a decade back India sign
the convention on the rights of Persons with Disabilities 
It also signed the two optional protocols 
To the convention on the rights of the child
related to human rights 
one dealing with children armed conflict,
the other dealing with sale of children, child prostitution etc 
This is at one level and under these human rights treaties,
there is a compulsory requirement of state party reporting 
In fact, the state is supposed to have a broad based consultation
with various stakeholders and in preparing a report
for the treaty monitoring body and in fact,
from time to time, as mentioned in those treaties,
the executive prepares
periodic reports to the committee on the rights of the child,
In fact, the Mahbub ul Haq the famous economist
economic, social, cultural rights committee, the human rights committee,
and the CERD committee and so on so for and
thereafter, the senior government officials who across
to Geneva or New York appeared before the treaty body,
which is consists of some independent persons answered their queries
and at the end of the day, when the treaty body
give some concluding observations and recommendations,
and these are again, implemented at the ground level by the executive
the follow up action is initiated by the executive,
and it is monitored by the executive 
came up with a new term called humane governance,
When the Commission on Human Rights at the international level
was replaced by the Human Rights Council in the year 2006 
There was a new mechanism called Universal Periodic Review
that was adopted by the UN General Assembly 
Under the Universal Periodic Review, there is a 20 Page,
state party report in page report compiled by United Nations
of all the special procedures, mandate holders and 10 page report from
other stakeholders, including National Human Rights institutions
and non governmental organization 
Here again, this process, which happens once in four years or so,
which is again very critical to the task of protection
it covers all countries of the world 
And the countries have to have a broad based consultations
on the challenges on the achievements
and factors impeding the achievements of human rights,
and these are submitted in a state party report and here again,
there is a peer review process by the 47 countries
which are part of the Human Rights Council at the end of it,
there again, some recommendations have made for taking follow up action
by the executive 
To sum up or in conclusion,
and promotion of human rights 
the executive has a critical role in the task of protection and
promotion of human rights and it
does it in a number of ways,
including implementation of legislation, enforcement of legislations
and also formulation of policies,
programs, schemes, monitoring, and also in translating
international human rights standards into reality
at the ground level 
Thank you 
And the executive has a important role
in ensuring good governance and humane governments 
How does it do this task ?
under the swyam platform  Today, we will take up the module
For instance, we have already seen in the last module,
how the in detail the role of legislature 
Legislature, one of the main task is to
pass legislation from time to time, and it is the
role of the executive to implement the legislations
that have been enacted by the parliament 
and also see that various legislative provisions are
enforced at the ground level 
If you see the Constitution of India, the part five deals with
the executive with the center
dealing with role of executive in the task of protection and
and Part Six deals with the executive in states and
details are all mentioned there in the constitution and their powers
etc , or enshrined there 
For instance, there is a Union Cabinet
which advises the president and all executive action
is done in the name of the President of India 
And cabinet consists of senior ministers and there is a
collective responsibility and in addition to
implementation of legislations and enforcement of legislations,
the executive also has a critical role in the formulation of
promotion of human rights 
policies, programs, schemes, from time to time,
in order to realize various constitutional goals,
various constitutional ideals
and the directive principles of state policy and the agenda of the
government of the day 
For instance, this task also covers
policy, monitoring, policy review, policy corrections 
You look at the executive at the center
there are a number of ministries, which have been established 
For instance, you have a ministry of home affairs,
We have earlier considered the role
ministry of women and child development
and ministry of minority affairs,
ministry dealing with disability, labour,
health and family welfare, human resource development,
social justice and empowerment, tribal affairs
and these are just examples of a few ministries
As you can see by the names of these ministries
they have a critical role in translating
the constitutional ideals, constitutional goals
or the international treaty commitments to which India is a party 
of judiciary and the role of legislature in detail, as you have seen
And earlier on India was following the five year plans
but these five year plans were recently abandoned,
and the Niti Aayog came into existence and
let me give you few examples of the schemes which are
directly relevant to the task of protection
and promotion of human rights 
For instance, you all are aware of the
article 21 dealing with right to life
and how it has been,
interpreted in a very expansive manner by the supreme court of India
the National Human rights protection system 
and how many other rights were read into this article 21 
Take for instance swachh Bharat which aims at cleanliness 
As you know, sanitation is one of the social determinants of right to health 
And if you ensure sanitation, you can prevent diseases 
Swachh Bharat is a program launch and there is a
it's like a movement, it's like a like a to create a
consciousness among the citizens 
Let me give a few more examples 
For instance, there is a Ayushman Bharat scheme 
right to health is an important right and in the Ayushman Bharat Scheme
in that system, the executive is an important cornerstone in the
tries to reach out to a large number of people in India
and ensuring that they enjoy the right to health 
What about safe drinking water ?
which is again an important human rights 
there is a scheme dealing with Bhagirathi
which aims at providing safe drinking water 
The prime minister's awas yojana seeks to cover
the right to housing 
For instance, there is a Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme
which seeks to ensure that female infanticide,
overall National Human rights protection system 
female feticide is address and in addition, the right to education
of the girl children is clearly protected 
Right to food as an important economic, social cultural right 
For instance,
the mid-day meal scheme is a an important tool which is in the
hands of the executive to ensure that right to food of all is
secured particularly the children at the vulnerable sections
is secured 
To you take for instance Prime Minister's Jan-dhan yojana
which aims set financial inclusion and
Besides legislature, judiciary, civil society
Music
which sought to protect the right to food of its citizens 
The same way
right to work is again, an important economic, social, cultural right
and the government adopted National Rural Employment Guarantee Act,
which sought to provide hundred days of employment
to a person under certain conditions 
Right to Information is regarded as a an important right,
which enables a person to realize many other rights
and Right to Information Act was adopted,
enacted in the year 2005 and it has been able to
with each of them having an important or significant role in the task of
bring about a paradigm shift from an regime governed under the
Official Secrets Act to a regime which is marked by
transparency and citizen can by paying a partially Some of rupees 10
can seek a information which is of atmost critical importance to him 
Parliament has also enacted a legislations dealing with the
protection of whistleblowers and also a number of other important aspects 
This is one end, in addition to the passing the legislation,
there are a number of instruments that are open
to members of parliament to advance human rights 
They use techniques such as question hour,
protection and promotion of human rights 
zero hour, call attention motion, cut motion,
parliamentary debates, to advance Human Rights for instance
parliamentary questions are of two types 
There is a starred question and unstarred question 
The National Human Rights Commission has noted that
since the adoption of protection of human rights act,
the number of questions relating to human rights questions
has really gone up in the Parliament and
the starred questions are often accompanied by a supplementary
question by the person concerned 
Members of parliament represent the bill of the people
So, in addition to these parliamentary questions, there is a zero hour
which follows immediately after the question hour 
So, in the zero hour, the members of parliament
again have
have a opportunity to draw attention of the executive
to draw attention of the house
to critical burning issues relating to human rights 
So, parliament is a supreme body and it approves the budget 
It approves, how each rupee shall
be spent by the executive 
they in a way,
And in this process there are demands for grants 
There are deep discussions on the budget
and the budgets reflects the prioritization
across competing demands 
On the one hand, you have socio economic programmes 
On the other hand, you have other programmes 
So, how money shall be apportioned between different competing demands
is considered by the parliament and approved by the parliament 
And often Members of Parliament move cut motions
or make changes in the way these some sort of portion
or trustees of the people's aspirations, the legislature
and some of them are under pinned by the considerations of human rights 
In addition to budgets, there is something called
call attention motion 
Members of Parliament can move a motions for a call attention
whenever there are some serious issues like starvation deaths
or other burning human rights issues
or other issues concerning nation or concerned and they seek
answers from the executive 
</ep  So, while we have some limited sessions
throughout the year of a few weeks each like a budget session,
is also a guardian of human rights 
winter session, monsoon session  In between these sessions
there are parliamentary committees,
which can transact a lot of work in a very silent manner 
For example, there are committees are of two types,
there are parliamentary consultative committees
attached to different ministries 
There are you have standing committees
which are of a permanent nature under Ad hoc committees 
For instance there is a standing committee
on the welfare of schedule caste 
We will see what exactly is its role
There's a standing committee on the welfare of other backward classes 
Standing Committee on women and these committees
a standing committee on labour,
standing committee on food and public distribution system 
And these committees are basically elected or appointed by the
speaker or the house concerned 
And during these committees proceedings,
a lot of important legislative work is transacted 
Parliament also has a very important role in acting as a
check on the executive 
in the task of protection and promotion of human rights 
For instance, there are parliamentary committees
of a special type like committee on estimates,
committee on subordinate legislation,
Public Accounts Committee, Committee on Public undertakings
committee on various governance
government assurances for instance sometimes members of
parliament ask questions in the question hour and when the
government of the day give spot information and then promises to
share the information at a subsequent stage 
That becomes an assurance to the parliament
And we will also see how members of parliament advance
and which is tracked and which is, for instance,
tracked by the committee on government assurances 
And these special committees act
as a check on the expenditure of the government
or on the policies of the government and thus
hold the entire system accountable 
Now to conclude,
parliament has a critical role to play in the task of
protection and promotion of human rights 
Members of Parliament in a way act as the guardian of human rights 
this task of protection and promotion of human rights 
Dear students,
They pass legislations they use a variety of means,
including a question hour, zero hour, call attention motion,
cut motion and other private member's bill 
And they also use parliamentary committees,
standing committees, Ad hoc committees to advance
the task of protection of human rights, promotion of human rights
and they also serve as a check on the executive
and hold the executive accountable 
Thank you 
As you know,
legislature, it's main role is passing legislations
and if you look at the legislations, there are two kinds 
On the one hand you have a constitutional amendment acts 
On the other hand, you have the regular legislation 
Let us take up the constitution of India
which is the supreme law of the country 
It has undergone more than 100 amendments
in the past 17 years or so 
In fact, let me tell you there in
welcome the MOOC on Human Rights In India 
among all these hundred odd amendments,
there are some amendments, which have a great significance
for the protection and promotion of human rights of the people 
For instance, you take up 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments
that were adopted by the parliament 
They sought to provide 33% reservation for women
in the gram panchayats and in the municipalities,
which are basically the units of local self government 
It's a very for reaching move, considering that even in the
parliament at the national level, the proportion of woman
Today we take up the role of legislature, in the task of
has never crossed beyond 12% so far 
And if you look at 86th constitutional amendment act,
it sought to provide a right to
free and compulsory education for those children
between the age of 6 and 14 years  Recently, the parliament adopted
103rd constitutional amendment act, which sought to provide
10% reservation for persons belonging to economically weaker sections
in educational institutions 
When you look at the regular legislations,
there have been a plethora of legislations that are
protection and promotion of human rights 
adopted by the parliament 
For instance, in 1993, the parliament adopted
the protection of human rights act, which provided for the Constitution of
National Human Rights Commission and state human rights commission's
at the states and also human rights codes 
And if you look at the preamble of the protection of Human Rights Act,
these bodies were constituted quote unquote
for better protection of human rights 
The parliament has also enacted special legislations
for the creation of national commission for women
You already seen in the first module,
national commission for minorities and
national commission for children and many other bodies 
Let's take a look at the legislations that were adopted for women 
In fact, historically, women did not enjoy a high social,
economic or political status, though they constitute nearly half the sky 
In fact, parliament in its wisdom, the lawmakers in their
zeal enacted a number of legislations
which sought to protect the rights of women,
including the ones dealing with abolishing of Sati
abolishing of dowry,
the National Human Rights Protection system
in decent representation,
prevention of immoral trafficking
and many
other like legislation, including the prevention of domestic violence, etc 
You take children, children are vulnerable 
They are the future of any country
and because of their vulnerability, because of their tender age,
their label for exploitation, the parliament has adopted
a number of impressive legislations dealing with like
prohibition of child marriages, prohibition of child labour
which consists of
and pre-conception pre-natal diagnostics act
and a number of other legislations, which seek to guarantee or protect
the rights of children 
In so far as persons belonging to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes,
which are again vulnerable section of the population,
there is on the one hand protection of civil rights act 
And then there is a prevention of atrocities
against scheduled castes and scheduled tribes act 
And the parliament also enacted legislation, which sought to
eliminate manual scavenging and construction of dry latrines or even
with the NHRI, at the core and legislature, executive,
eliminate the scourge of bonded labour 
Recently, the government also a number of years back adopted
the scheduled tribes and other traditional forest dwellers
and the protection of rights act 
In addition to these categories, the parliament also enacted
legislation for the protection of the
rights of persons with disabilities in the year 1995,
which was amended recently in 2016 
Like right to food is an important economic, social, cultural right 
And the government in 2006, came out with the National Food Security act,
judiciary and civil society at four different corners
shall be deemed members of the national human rights commission
for carrying out functions which are specified in Section 12 (b) to (j)
of the protection of Human Rights Act  We will see shortly
what is this section 12  Section 12 basically defines the
functions of the National Human Rights Commission
and according to section 33 of the act,
the deemed members shall have
a role in all functions of the NHRC except the one dealing with
handling individual complaints of human rights violations 
And as for as the individual complaints of
First, the historical context:
human rights violations are concerned
the six main members
Music
or the main commission, shall alone have the competence to
handle these complaints 
let us see the section 4 of
the protection of Human Rights Act, which talks
about the appointment of a chairperson 
In fact, the chairperson and members are appointed
by a high level body of six members,
music
headed by the Prime Minister of India, and the
composition of this high level committee includes
Music
the Speaker of the Lok Sabha,
the Deputy Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha,
and also leaders of opposition from both the houses and also
the home minister 
So in a way the composition is   
Music
is a very high level one and the presence of the leaders of opposition
The UNESCO first mooted the idea of a national commission
Music
in this committee  is a kind of an assurance that only
people with high integrity, high credibility gets selected for
appointment as chairperson and members 
Section 6 of the Protection of Human Rights Act
talks about the tenure of the chairperson and members,
according to it, the chairperson shall have a tenure of three years
or he can go up to the age of 70 years 
And the chairperson is also eligible
for reappointment for a further term 
for the protection and promotion of human rights,
On the other hand, the members are appointed for a term
of three years and they have no chance for getting reappointed
for this second term 
In addition to the things that we
have seen earlier on the protection of Human Rights Act 
also specifies the manner of removal of chairperson and members 
They could either resign or can be removed after a
proper inquiry for proven misbehaviour or incapacity 
If you look at the following graphic, it clearly tells on the
various grounds for the removal of chairperson and members 
but he did not catch much steam 
These are more or less on the lines  of a similar provisions for
the removal of judges of the Supreme Court of India 
Music
Section 12 of the Protection of Human Rights Act gives the functions
of the Commission 
In fact,  there are many ac    functions of the commission
starting with individual complaints
Music
in fact  the commission has the power to
take up complaints about human rights violations 
In 70s this idea was again revived, but eventually,
These complaints can be of
Music
of two kinds, one  acts of commission,
or omission by a public servant 
And it can be either  brought by  petition from the affected individual
or sua moto cognitions based on newspaper reports
or it can be triggered by referral from a court of law 
The commission also has the power to intervene in a pending
proceeding in a court of law which involves substantive
dimensions of human rights 
in the early 90s, there was an international conference on the issue of
The Commission can also visit jails
and other such institutions where persons are kept for
reformation or  other purposes, and make recommendations for
better living conditions and protection of human rights in
these institutions 
The commission can also review
Music
the safeguards that are provided in constitution of India and other
laws that have been adopted by the parliament and such as
recommendations for better protection of human rights 
national mechanisms for the protection and promotion of human rights
The commission can also undertake and promote research,
spread human rights literacy and awareness and promote the
activities of non governmental organizations 
The Commission has a statutory responsibility
to monitor international human rights conventions
and make recommendations  There on section 12
of the Protection of Human Rights Act also requires the commission
to study  factors which impede the enjoyment of human rights,
say for instance, terrorism or poverty or any such factors
Music
that was held in Paris, which adopted the Paris principles
in a some in the commission is supposed to work on multiple
legs on many walk on many legs, both protection as well as promotion 
If you see the following graphic, it brings out very clearly
the various  functions of the National Human Rights Commission 
In order to discharge these functions,  the section 13 of the Act
stipulates that it will have the powers of a civil court,
it can summon people, ask for any documents, ask for witnesses
to depose before it and sections fo    14 enables the NHRC
to utilize the services of any investigative agencies 
that is in position 
and subsequently, these were adopted by the UN commission on
Dear Students, Welcome to MOOC on human rights in India 
Section 17 of the act talks about the procedure
for dealing with inquiry into complaints 
The moment a complaint comes the commission may
ask for a report 
And if it is satisfied with the report of the
concern state government or the  central government,
it may either  accept it or if it's not    satisfied,
it can conduct an inquiry  And section 18 of the
protection of Human Rights Act, talks about steps after inquiry 
The after  finding a prima facie a violation of human rights
human rights and also by the UN general assembly 
the commission could either recommend the payment of
compensation to a victim 
It can also  recommend prosecution of the
guilty personnel who have committed the violation of human rights
or it can also make other  orders
Music
the commission also has the
power to approach the supreme court or high court
for issue of appropriate <?> ritged </?> orders
for enforcement of its recommendations 
So this adoption of the Paris principles gave a further plip
One interesting thing about the National Human Rights Commission is that
it has the power to award in    interim relief,
even  pending the conclusion of a particular inquiry 
If it is satisfied that  the circumstances merit the
award of a interim relief to  victim 
Section 19 of the protection of Human Rights Act
stipulates the procedure for dealing with complaints of
human rights violations committed by armed forces personnel
Here, the commission can seek a report from
the relevant  authority that is in the case central government 
to the establishment of national human rights commission's
the Ministry of defence and after receiving the report,
the commission can make its own finding 
There is one important distinction between
human rights violations committed by
Music
public servants in general, and the acts committed
by armed forces personnel with regard to the violations
committed by personnel of armed forces is separate procedure has
been mentioned in the protection of Human Rights Act 
The commission cannot investigate the violations committed by the
and if you look at the Indian context,
personnel of armed forces and this issue has been critiqued by
many civil society groups 
Music
Section 20 talks about submission of annual reports or
special reports by the National Human Rights Commission 
Music
One interesting thing here is that the government is required
or mandated by the protection of human rights act,
to submit a memorandum of on the action taken on the
recommendations of the National Human Rights Commission 
there were international  calls
In case it is not accepting any particular  recommendation,
the government is required to spell out the reasons for
non acceptance of the recommendations and this document
is required to be laid on the table of the parliament 
So this in a way  so, accountability, it holds the
executive accountable for protection and promotion of human rights 
Section 21 deals with the state human rights commission's and these,
the state human rights commission's have more or less
the same functions as the National Human Rights Commission 
But the one important distinction is that look at the
for accountability for human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir,
list two and list three in the 7th schedule of the constitution
which basically deal with the state list
and concurrent list the SHRC have
mandate over these items which or mentioned in the state list
or in the concurrent list 
The chairperson of the commission can be appointed by a
high level committee and he    he can hold an office for a year or
three year term and is eligible for reappointment 
And the chairperson has to be
former chief justice or a judge of a high court 
in the northeast, in Andhra Pradesh, and  not only
And it's a the state human rights commission's are supposed
to be a three member body with one chairperson and one member
who has been a judge of the high court and one member who has a
practical experience in the matters relating to human rights 
Section 30 of the protection Human Rights talk
talks about human rights court that  it enables
state governments to specify
a sessions court in every district to try  violations of
human rights in the human rights court 
Does the NHRC which has been established
international outcries, but also there were aspirations from the
under the protection of human rights act
1993 comply with the Paris principles 
We have seen in the earlier module of these Paris principles,
how they talk about wide mandate, how to talk
about autonomy, independence, and also adequate powers of
investigation, pluralism, etc  The National Human Rights
Commission's mandate covers both civil, political as well as
economic, social, cultural rights 
Music
And in that sense it has a
civil society within India for establishment of a mechanism  for
wide mandate  In fact the manner of appointment of

removal or such that they are required to  maintain independence

financial autonomy, the amount of money  that is
spent by an NHRC is voted by the parliament  through some grants 
And there is a body of personnel under the Investigation Division,
which is answerable only to the National Human Rights Commission 
And the commission also, as we have earlier seen,
has six members of whom at least there shall be one woman member
better protection of human rights  And that's how, in the
In this module, we take up the protection of human rights act 1993 
and the by virtue of
the chairperson of the National Commission for women,
minorities, SC's, ST's, children and also
backward classes and also the chief commissioner for persons
with disability being   made as deemed members of the NHRC
contributes towards the pluralism of the commission 
And so in a way
these elements go on to strengthen the commission 
But the civil society has its own reservation and wants it to be
more effective and robust body 
month of September 1993, an ordinance was passed by the
Music
In the act was initially adopted in the year 1993 
It was amended once in 2006 and again recently in 2019 
And  with a view to making this  further compliant
with the Paris principles with a view to  making the body
pluralistic, with a view to making it more effective, and
the civil society of course is not fully happy or satisfied
with the amendments that have been  enacted in the year 2019 
On the whole
Music
Government of India,
here is a act which provides for the
Constitution of a national commission at the center,
the state human rights commission's at the states
and also human rights courts and they have all been their
functions, their powers and then the procedures have all
been  mentioned in the Protection of Human Rights Act 
See you in the next module happy learning 
Music
establishing a National Human Rights Commission,
with justice Ranganath Mishra, as the chair
subsequently, a legislation was introduced in the Lok Sabha as
it was passed and that's how the protection of Human Rights act 1993
was adopted by India 
let us look at the various features of the
Music
this act 
In this module, we will look at three things 
The preamble of this legislation captures the spirit 
If you look at the preamble, there is a reference to the
establishment of a National Human Rights Commission
at the union level, and also state human rights commission's
in various states and human rights courts for,
quote unquote better protection of human rights 
So the
Music
prior to this  1993 Protection of Human Rights Act,
the supreme court the high courts had been
The historical context in which
custodians of human rights had been
jealously guarding human rights, in need was felt for
establishment of a special mechanisms for better protection
of human rights 
As   captured in the preamble to this act 
Definition of human rights is an extremely important element,
which is given in the section 2(d) section 2(d) defines  human rights as
right to life, right to liberty, right to equality
and right to dignity, which are guaranteed by the Constitution
of India or embodied in the international covenants and
Music
enforceable in Indian courts  Section two of the Protection of
Human Rights Act further defines these international covenants as
the International Covenants on civil and political rights 1966 
The international covenant on economic social and cultural rights 1966
and such other conventions
Music
which are adopted by the
UN general assembly and which are specified by the
government of india in a gadget  So, this is how the human rights
have been defined in the protection of Human Rights Act
the protection of human rights act was
in both section 2(d) read along with section 2f of the
protection of Human Rights Act  Chapter two of the protection of
Human Rights Act talks about the National Human Rights Commission 
In particular if you see the section 3(2), it talks
about the  NHRC that it shall consists of
Music
a chairperson,
Music
two members from higher judiciary, and three members from  people
who have  expert knowledge and experience in matters relating
adopted and enacted  Secondly, we will also see the
to human rights 
According to Section 3(2) there shall be a chairperson
who has been
Music
the chief justice or a Judge of a Supreme Court of India 
And one member shall be judge of the Supreme Court 
And one member shall be a former Chief Justice of the High Court,
and three members of whom at least one
shall be a woman from those who have special knowledge or
experience in matters relating to human rights 
provisions of the human rights act 
Thus, there are
the commission shall consists of six members, three drawn from
the higher judiciary, and three from those  who have special
knowledge and experience in human rights 
In addition, section 3(3) of the protection of Human Rights Act
talks about seven deemed members 
For instance, the chairpersons of the national commission for minorities,
national commission for women, scheduled castes, scheduled tribes,
backward classes, the commission for protection of child rights
and also the chief commissioner for persons with disabilities
And we will also see how they comply with the Paris principles 
one lakh cases every year  The law division is headed by a registrar
who is supported by several presenting officers, one joint registrar
and many deputy registrar's and assistant registrar's,
very important and high profile cases are placed before the
full commission of six members chairperson and five members
and instances relating to custodial deaths and other
matters are often placed before division bench 
And there are of course, single member benches are there 
Music
The Commission also has
It was established on 12 October 1993,
Music
camp sittings at other places within India
and where it handles matters 
Music
In addition to the law division, we have
an investigation division in the National Human Rights Commission
headed by the  an officer of the rank of Director General of police,
and this division
Music
investigates complaints  which are referred to it by the Commission 
under the protection of human Rights Act, 1993
And it also monitors deaths in police custody,
deaths in judicial custody and
Music
deaths in fake encounters or what are called extra judicial executions 
The administrative division of the commission
handles all establishment matters, personnel, library,
publications, computers, and many other issues 
The training division tries to sensitize
people within government or outside government about issues
relating to human rights 
and which was subsequently amended in the year 2006, and also in 2019 
The training division also organizers,
short term and long term internship programmes 
Music
The policy research program and projects division
Music
looks at research on important aspects relating to human rights
and also monitoring the international human rights conventions
and making recommendations to the
government from time to time 
The Policy Research Division basically, whenever NHRC feels
What are the important characteristics or
that a particular matter is of such importance that it requires
sustained monitoring over the years that is converted into a
project,  say for instance, trafficking in women and children,
quality assurance in mental health, or elimination of bonded labour
or child labour, or manual scavenging some of these matters
requires sustained,
continuous monitoring and these are converted into programs and
projects and entrusted to the policy research programs and
projects division 
Again recall, there are five divisions in the commission law,
features of the National Human Rights Commission?
investigation, administration,
Music
training and Policy Research Division 
So, these five assists the Human Rights Commission
in the discharge of the various functions,
which are provided under Section 12 of the
Protection of Human Rights Act  I want to explain in some
detail, the complaint handling mechanism of the Commission 
Anybody who is affected or a non governmental organization can bring
a matter to the attention of the commission 
Music
Music
It should ideally be
violation of human rights committed by a public servant
or negligence in the prevention of a violation again by a public servant,
or the matter could be referred by a court of law to the NHRC 
A person who wants to complain can do so in a number ways 
He or she can file an online form
that has been provided for this purpose,
or send a self contained letter,
petition without the aid of any lawyer or the person can also
It is an
visit the commission and  give the or send a mail to the commission 
It's very important to understand what kind of
matters can be entertained by the commission and what cannot be 
Basically, the matter has to come under the ambit of the
protection of human rights, particularly the definition of
human rights that is mentioned in the section 2 of the
Protection of Human Rights Act and only acts of omission
or commission by public servants alone or the subject matter of the NHRC 
In other words, acts of private agents cannot be
normally be brought under the commission 
Music
For instance,
Music
an incidents which are more than one year old,
Music
cannot be referred to the NHRC for redressal, there is a
section 36 of the Protection of Human Rights Act, under which
there is a time limitation, aa   which is there, that these
complaints become time barred and thus become non entertainable 
In addition, if    the    com    if the complaint is already pending before
another commission, let's say a women's commission,
statutory body
children's commission or a scheduled cast commission,
or any other commission of Inquiry duly constituted
or it is sub judice before a court of law
this matters are not normally entertainable by the NHRC 
Let me explain the steps after inquiry 
A range of options are open to the commission
after inquiry into a complaint of human rights violation,
where there is a prima facie violation, the commission can recommend
award of monetary compensation  It could even be interim compensation
pending the conclusion of the inquiry 
having been established under the protection of human rights act 
Dear Students,
The commission can also recommend prosecution of the  guilty or errant
public servants involved in the  that particular incidents 
The Commission can share its report to the complainant
and the commission can also publish its report of
the human rights violation and also  the sworn order 
So    these    are     In addition to this, the commission can also approach
as a supreme court or a high court for issue of appropriate
directions and <?> rigged </?> 
So, these are range of courses which are
range of options which are available to the NHRC after
In addition, it is a recommendatory body 
inquiry into  violation of human rights 
Under Section 19 of the protection human rights act
as a restricted procedure has been provided for
dealing with violations committed by armed forces personnel 
Let me  take you through a list of illustrative cases 
In the first case, we will look at what the commission did
in the case of deaths of civilians
Music
in the Bijbehara 
It is the first case taken by the NHRC soon after its
In the sense that it cannot issue binding orders
establishment in 1993 
i    this    In this incident, there was an unprovoked
firing on unarmed civilians
by Border Security Force personnel,
which led to the death of 60 civilians
and the commission took suo moto cognizance based on newspaper reports,
called for reports from the concerned
agencies and thereafter recommended action against the
errant BSF personnel under the BSF act, payment of compensation
to the next of kin of those who died 
or <?> rigged </?> like the courts of law,
The NHRC also said
the deployment pattern of BSF personnel should be reviewed
particularly when they are asked to operate in civilian areas 
Music
Let me take you to a get another case involving
Chakma and Hajong refugees in Arunachal Pradesh 
These persons fled the then east Pakistan
and settled in Arunachal Pradesh 
In response to complaints from people's Union for civil liberties,
Amnesty International and others 
Music
The National Human Rights Commission made a series of
recommendations to the government of Arunachal Pradesh
with the request to or with a to protect the right to life and
property of these refugees 
When  the commission
found that there was a  unusually long delay or a protracted  delay
on the part of the state government in implementing these
recommendations, the commission took up a petition to the
Supreme Court of India and the Supreme Court gave directions to
the concerned state government and others to ensure that the
where it finds prima facie violation
right to life and property of the chakma refugees is protected 
Gujarat riots happened in the year 2002 in which many
persons of   muslim origin died, and there was a loss of home
state and other  property 
The commission took fact finding,
and based on that made
Music
a series of recommendations to the government of Gujarat
for rehabilitation of victims, and also for
Music
or where it finds an important burning issue relating to human rights,
detailed investigation of each of these cases, when it found
that there was lack of action  The commission was constrained
to take the matter to the Supreme Court of India and
thereafter  in a number of cases, a positive action has happened
and the  victims have got some relief, and the    the courts also
have been able to prosecute a number of persons responsible 
Let me  draw your attention to a right to food case 
in    the    In Orissa about some two decades back there was
in what are known as KBK districts basically,  Koraput,
Bolangir and Kalahandi districts, there was  reports of
it can only make suitable recommendations to the
starvation deaths and the commission sent senior most persons for
Music
on the spot investigation  And thereafter, the commission
asked a special rapporteur to monitor the situation and in
the Orissa starvation deaths case, the NHRC made a series of
short term and long term recommendations to the state
government and the central government  particularly with
regard to the public distribution system, employment generation program,
irrigation programmes, agricultural programmes
and many other programmes and    and the sustained monitoring by the commission
concerned authority for implementation 
has led to some positive impact on the ground 
In addition to these, there were matters relating to
Music
Punjab mass cremation,
was referred by Supreme Court to the NHRC for monitoring 
And the commission also went into atrocities
committed by special Task Force personnel, constituted by
government of Tamil Nadu and government of Karnataka to nab
the sandalwoods smuggler Veerappan,
and particularly they tribals
Music
became  victims in the process
and the commission made a 
a record a compensation  after finding    after fact finding on the ground after
and after  ascertaining the facts 
In addition, the Commission has intervened in many many cases
involving child labour, bonded labour, violation of the
rights of women, children and other sections of people 
In this module, we have seen the structure, composition role of
the NHRC and also it's important characteristics at some
important cases taken by NHRC 
In addition,
Welcome to MOOC on the National Human Rights Commission 
Thank you
See you in the next module 
Music
Music
it is compliant with Paris principles has a wide mandate
And it is also an independent body 
And how is this independence ensured ?
Music
The term of service of chairperson and members is fixed 
Music
For instance, it is a three years under the amended act in 2019 
Music
They cannot be removed
In the earlier module, we saw the Protection of Human Rights Act 
Music
at the whims and fancies of the government in power,
and the manner of their removal is laid down in the statuted 
Their salary cannot be reduced during their tenure 
So all these features give independence to the
National Human Rights Commission 
It also has the powers of a civil court
while handling complaints of human rights   violations 
So all these features go on to make it
a strong, powerful body
And in this module, we'll take up the structure,
Music
which is needed to address protection and promotion of
human rights issues in the country 
Let us now turn our attention to the composition of the Commission,
as provided in the section 3 of the Protection of Human Rights Act 
Students, I wish to draw your attention to the
graphic in this regard, please follow the
graphic for the current composition of the
National Human Rights Commission 
As you can see from the table,
composition,
the commission is headed by a former Chief Justice of India,
Justice H L  Dattu who is the chairperson and
there are currently in addition to chairperson,
three other members, Shri Justice Prafulla Chandra Pant
is a member, Smt  Jyotika Kalra and Dr  Dnyaneshwar Manohar Mulay
are the members 
There are two vacancies currently in addition,
there are deemed members and as you can see from the table,
the chairperson of the National Commission for minorities is
SC's, ST's, women, child Rights Commission and
Music
commission for Backward Classes
and the chief Commissioner for persons with disabilities
or the ex-officio members or deemed members,
and they participate in the meetings of the statutory full commission 
Section 3 also provides that there shall be a
secretary general, who will be chief executive officer of the Commission 
The Secretary General can exercise
all administrative, financial powers, subject of course to the
control of the chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission 
He can not have any role in judicial functions
role, important features of the National Human Rights Commission,
or the power to draw regulations
which are only with the commission 
If you look at the adm    structure of the NHRC,
it is divided into five divisions 
I draw your attention to the graphic, which
the five divisions of the commission or given there is a law division,
there is an investigation division and there is a
Music
administrative division and training division and there is a
policy research programmes, projects division 
and also how it carries out investigation or inquiry 
Let us take up law division,
Music
law division handles
Music
all matters right from the stage of
receipt of complaints of human rights violation,
processes them and then places them before the
commission for appropriate directions and follows up the
action taken 
It normally receives around hundred thousands or
Music
immediate interium relief to the victim or prosecution of the
errant or guilty police personnel 
It took the matters to the court of law
for enforcement of these orders or published
these recommendations  So these are the various steps
which are involved after the inquiry into a
human rights violation 
Let us turn our attention to the second major function,
which has been entrusted to the NHRC 
That is namely intervention in a pending court proceeding 
Protection of Human Rights Act 1993 
For instance, if the commission
comes to the decision that here is a matter, which involves
substantive human rights issue, and where the commission can
seek the permission of the that particular court and with its
permission, intervene in that proceeding, are in order to
achieve a larger purpose 
So, under this section 12(B),
the commission has intervene in many cases 
I'll give you a few examples 
For instance, there was a case of a Charanjit Singh,
Secondly, we will also see,
who was launched in Delhi prison
and who was languishing in the prison
as an undertrial prisoner for about 16 years,
and he was also mentally challenged as a result of his
mental health condition, his trial could not proceed 
And whereas he continued to languish in the
prison to the commission notice this
and the commission special rapporteur during the prison visits
notice this issue
and brought this matter to the attention of the Delhi High Court
what did NHRC do under each of these
and asked for crashing of the trial and transfer of
Charanjit Singh to a mental institution 
Accordingly, the Delhi High Court accepted
the NHRC's requests and order the
quashing of the trial of Charanjit Singh and also his
transfer to mental health institution 
And in the process, series of guidelines were also
adopted by the National Human Rights Commission
and they were placed before the High Court and which
the High Court accepted for handling such cases 
functions that have been listed under the Section 12 of the
Let me turn your attention to another case Machang Lalung in Assam 
So here the National Human Rights Commission special rapporteur,
during his visits to the prison, notice that
a elderly person a mentally challenged person was
languishing in a prison for about 54 years 
And in 20s, this guy Machang Lalung was admitted
or was imprisoned, but after
about a decade of his imprisonment, his trial could
not proceed on account of his mental health condition 
And but he as a result he
Protection of Human Rights Act 
languished in the prison for about 54 years,
which is know a quite a good part of his youth and life
as a result of the neglect of the society,
as a result of the neglect of the authorities 
And here was his substantive case,
which involved the human rights of prisoners 
This is the commission took this matter
and made a recommendation to the government of Assam
to release him and also later on,
the matter went to the Supreme Court
Music
and the supreme court also ordered the payment of a
sum of rupees three lakh to Machang Lalung 
So, there are many such instances where
a NHRC has intervened in a pending court proceeding
involving substantive human rights dimensions 
So NHRC had been having a symbiotic relationship
or a with the high judiciary, in the sense that
Music
where NHRC was not able to enforce its orders 
It has taken such cases to the Supreme Court or the High Courts
let me turn your attention to this graphic 
for issue of writs orders for let's say in the case of
Chakma Hajong Refugees in Arunachal Pradesh, or in
the instance of Gujarat riots  And there are many other cases
where the commission itself took matters to the Supreme Court of India 
On the other hand, the Supreme Court also
remitted to the NHRC issues like Punjab mass cremations,
of some 2097 unidentified dead bodies,
or elimination of child labour, bonded labour,
or monitoring the conditions in mental hospitals
in Agra, Ranchi, Gwalior and women's remaned home in Agra 
Music
So there had been this kind of a
healthy relationship, a complimentary relationship between
higher judiciary on the one hand
and the National Human Rights Commission on the other 
The third is a,
visits to jails, mental hospitals,
Music
and make recommendations for the protection of the human rights of
inmates living there 
In pursuance of this statutory responsibility,
As we have seen earlier on NHRC has been given
the chairperson, members or the special rapporteurs,
or senior officers of the NHRC
have undertaken visits to prisons, documented
human rights violations, made recommendations in fact, if you
see in the year 2016 and 17 that is the last or the latest annual
report, which has been submitted to the Government of India 
It lists a number of such visits to the individual prisons by the
commission's rapporteurs and under each of these visits,
there are a number of lacuna have been identified,
documented, and a recommendations have been made
a range of functions, starting from redressal of
Dear students,
to the concerned authorities for redressal of the conditions there 
Let me turn your attention to Section 12(d),
wherein there's a responsibility caste on the commission to
review, loss, either draft legislation or an existing legislation
and to make recommendations to the government 
Music
In pursuance of this, the commission reviewed
Music
many legislations and made
Music
Music
very important recommendations to the government 
In fact, if you look at the its old founding statute,
that is the protection of human rights act 
The Commission constituted a high level committee headed by
a former Chief Justice of India Justice Ahmadi,
and which went into this entire
working of the Protection of Human Rights Act 
And then the NHRC after studying Justice Ahmadi report
made a series of recommendations to the Government of India
for amending its own founding statute 
individual complaints of human rights violations to intervention in
In specifically, it asked for
a number of additional powers  Some of these recommendations
have been accepted by the government and they have been
implemented, but there are some other recommendations which have
not been taken on board 
In the same way, the NHRC reviewed
Music
the Freedom of Information Act,
reviewed the child marriage restraint act,
reviewed the Persons with Disabilities Act
court proceedings, involving serious human rights issues,
and the Anti-terrorism legislation  like TADA, POTA, etc  and
made substantive recommendations to government
in many of these interventions
have led to positive results with the government accepting
the recommendations 
Let me take you to the another
important statutory responsibility of the commission
namely, review of international human rights standards 
Under this the commission for instance,
made examine the existing standards
visits to jails, mental hospitals, begger homes,
in the year around 2000
to optional protocols were adopted to the convention on the
rights of the children, one dealing with child soldiers, the
other dealing with trafficking in children, commercial sexual
exploitation of children  So the
Music
based on the recommendations of the NHRC,
the Government of India signed and ratified these conventions 
Music
In the same vein, when the convention on the
Nari Niketans are to make recommendations
rights of persons with disabilities was adopted by the
UN General Assembly, the NHRC again commanded it to the
government for ratification, which the government did 
Music
The commission also recommended the signing of the torture convention 
It was after the great deal of engagement between
an NHRC and the government, the government signed it,
but the ratification is still awaited the NHRC has been
making recommendations from time to time in its own annual
reports about the early ratification of the convention
for the protection of the human rights of inmates living there,
on torture, cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment or
punishment of 1984 
The Commission also recommended
the accessions to the 1951 convention relating to the
status of refugees and it's optional 1976 optional protocol
and also accession to the additional protocols to the four
geneva conventions, which
have not been accepted by the Government of India 
The NHRC also has a statutory responsibility to
spread human rights literacy,
review of loss,draft bills
awareness through training programmes,
through seminars, workshops, internship and other such programmes 
So NHRC regularly conducts such sensitization
programmes involving across section of civil servants, NGO's,
students, academia and other sections 
The NHRC is required to submit annual reports
to the government and the government
is also required to submit an action taken report
on the recommendations of the Human Rights Commission 
Music
and also review of international human rights standards and to
In the end, let me take you to the
other statutory responsibility of NHRC 
Namely, encouraging the efforts of non governmental organizations
NHRC, and the civil society have a
mutually supportive role in the sense that they NGO's,
which are often operated the
grassroot level, identify human rights violations, they bring
them to the notice of the commission and thereafter, they
submit fact finding reports 
And in addition, they work as the
make recommendations
eyes and ears of the commission, and they undertake research projects 
So there are many ways in which NHRC and NGO's
closely collaborate with each other 
In conclusion, we have seen
that NHRC has to walk on many legs
and has a range of responsibilities
under the section 12 of the protection of Human Rights Act 
And we have also seen some examples of how it has
discharged his responsibilities under each of these functions 
Thank you 
Music
welcome to MOOC on Human Rights In India 
Happy learning and see you in the next module 
Music
promoting research on human rights issues 
Spreading human rights literacy, awareness
and also increasing the efforts of non governmental organizations 
In other words, NHRC is required to walk on
several legs, which can be broadly categorized as
protective function as well as promotional function 
Let us take each of these issues for a detailed examination 
Section 12(A) of the protection of Human Rights Act requires NHRC
to address individual complaints of human rights violations 
And as we have seen earlier on these complaints could be of two kinds
In this module, we take up
acts of omission as well as commission by public servants
and the term human rights itself has been defined under section
2 (D) of the protection of Human Rights Act every year, the NHRC
receives around hundred thousand complaints 
And this complaint redressal
is a major function of the commission 
An individual who is a victim of human rights violation
or a non governmental organization
can send a complaint,
either through post, to fax, through email or an online
the activities of the National Human Rights Commission 
and it can be in any language
which has been recognized in the Constitution of India 
All that is required is that it should relate to a
human rights violation and
Music
such complaints are registered in the law
division of the Commission and given a unique case number
and a unique file number 
And the complainants also can track the
status of their complaint disposal 
As part of the learning objectives,
And these complaints relate to a
broad range of areas, which not only
are civil and political, but also can be economic,
social, cultural rights violations 
For instance complaint can relate to custodial torture,
it can relate to false implication
and
Music
police high handedness,
or it can also relate to, let's say,
Music
denial of right to food, water, education,
social security, or many other things which are listed in the
economic, social, cultural rights 
NHRC typically has a range of
Music
courses open to it 
After detailed examination the commission may choose to
dismiss a complaint in limine in case it doesn't come under the
purview of the Protection of Human Rights Act,
or in other words, it doesn't cover or it
we plan to achieve two things 
is not a violation done by a public servant 
Or if it relates to a, let's say, a civil dispute,
or a complaint relating to non fulfillment of contractual obligation,
or if the complaint is vague or ambiguous 
Music
Once a complaint is admitted, again,
there are, let's say, a commission can either dispose it off
with directions to the appropriate authorities
with a request to redress it or the commission can transfer the
complaint to a state Human Rights Commission under Section 13(6) of
One is what are these statutory responsibilities
the protection of Human Rights Act for further
processing at the state Human Rights Commission in or the
commission can itself take cognizance of the complaint and
issue a notice to the authorities concerned are the
commission can also ask its own investigation division
to do fact finding or an on the spot study
and submitter report to it 
So these are the range of options which are open to the
NHRC and the commission has
where it found a prima facie violation as ordered payment of
that have been entrusted to the NHRC under Section 12 of the
Same is the case with
the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
So, these are some of the
positive intervention made by the NHRC
which will lead to successful outcomes in so far as
international human rights conventions are concerned 
Let's talk about spreading human rights, literacy awareness 
The NHRC has a statutory responsibility to spread
human rights literacy
and awareness of the safeguards amongst the general public 
and also the activities of the commission 
In pursuance, the NHRC engaged with the
National Council for Education Research or Training NCERT
and produced a source book on human rights
for teaching human rights in schools 
It also engaged with the National Council for Teacher Education
and produce materials for
teacher training on discrimination 
Involving gender, caste, and religion and other
prohibited grounds 
The NHRC also engaged with the University Grants Commission
In this module, we will look at the
about teaching of human rights
at the degree and other levels as a either as a compulsory
subject or as a degree program in itself 
Music
In addition, the NHRC also organized training programmes for
public servants, members of armed forces,
and also many other categories  It has evolved guide books for
judicial officers, online courses 
So, today in fact, if you look at the contemporary situation
in the past 26 years
successes or achievements of the commission resolve its failute
since the establishment of the commission in the year 1983,
there's a greater awareness about the what
the term human rights means 
And as a result, people in far flung areas of the country be
Tripura, be Mizoram, be not in other
far flung areas are able to
send individual complaints of human rights violation to the NHRC 
So the very fact that the commission is there, and has been
going around the country and making recommendations on
various important matters has laid and then coverage of the
We'll also look at the challenges faced by the
media of the NHRC activities
how all contributed in a big measure
to the spreading of the awareness of human rights
and it has had a positive impact on the society 
NHRC also visited jails, mental hospitals, pursuant to
its statutory responsibilities  and made many many important
recommendations for improving the conditions of those
institutions and all of them laid to some positive outcomes 
Let us look at the
Music
National Human Rights Commission  Before we go further, we need to
challenges faced by the Commission 
In fact as I said, the number of complaints
grew dramatically over the years 
And this huge case load and huge workload is an important
challenge faced by the commission 
This is coupled with lack of manpower
and lack of other resources and in fact
to the NHRC, if it has to effectively discharge its
mandate given to it by the parliamentarians, it needs more resources
it needs more staff, we were reviewing the challenges
understand clearly the nature of the body that we are talking 
faced by National Human Rights Commission 
In fact, the Paris principles require the commission to be
Music
independent and autonomous 
But let us look at the context in which NHRC functions 
Music
Many members of the civil society say the
respect for a culture of autonomy is absent 
And so in a way, the NHRC has a huge struggle 
When all I'll explain this point further,
NHRC as the founding fathers or the legislative makers have in Researched
let's say when all wings of the state, when all government departments
beat at the center or in states
Music
respect and recognize the functional,
the financial and at the autonomy of the NHRC,
then NHRC will be able to give its best 
Minus this respect they then it's an uphill
struggle for the commission 
Let us having covered the
achievements of the commission having covered the challenges of
is a recommendatory body,
the faced by the NHRC 
Let us turn to the criticisms against the NHRC 
Section 12(b) of the protection of human rights act
enables the commission
to intervene in any pending court proceeding with the
permission of the court, of course,
and in a matter which involves substantive human race issues 
Over the last 26 years the commission did intervene in a few cases,
but the activists would like would lve to see
more such intervention 
it is not a court of law, it cannot issue binding orders
There are
many, many important matters which are being
agitated and NHRC has not done much in so far as the
promise of Section 12(b) is concerned 
Let us turn our attention to the
review of international human rights conventions
and to make recommendations to the government 
The Human Rights Council
and the various special procedures mandate holders
have given a blank cheque to the NHRC in terms of
or writs  
Dear Students,
participation in various meetings in terms of
making substantive contribution to their work National Human
Rights Commission's have not really done much in terms of
sending a shadow reports or alternate reports to the treaty
monitoring bodies 
There are a few which have
used this provision and which have used the offer made by
the Human Rights Council
or by the treaty monitoring bodies,
or by other special procedures mandate holders of United Nations,
What happens when a body is a recommendatory body,
Human Rights Council and have intervened very effectively 
So here
the NHRC has a power to make its voice heard
at the international level
through the submission of alternate reports or shadow reports 
Here again, one would how allowed to see a
greater intervention by the commission 
Often NHRC sees compared to a toothless tiger
are an extension of a another
government departmen it's about the
it can
implementation of
the commission's recommendations at the grassroot level 
The commission is also faulted for lack of compliance
with Paris principles 
In fact, there's one about pluralism,
the commission structure and composition should be such that
various cross section of the general public is expected to be
represented in the NHRC 
But if you look at the commission many
civil society members hold that it doesn't really is not a
Music
pluralistic body in 2019, the Government of India
came out with certain amendments to the protection of Human Rights Act 
And then it increased the number of deemed members from 4 to 7
by adding the chairperson of the
National Commission for Backward classes,
National Commission for protection of child rights, and
the chief commissioner for personal disabilities has deemed members 
There are several issues here first of all, there
are allegations that some of these commission's
at the highest level, the appointments are done on political lines 
ask authorities concerned to range of things
Even in a NHRC this appointment of chairperson members
has been criticized a great deal that it is the civil
society members say it is not done in a transparent manner 
The public are not informed about the vacancies
and their qualifications, the manner of appointment
and the considerations for appointment  So, as a result, there are
serious issues about the full participation of these deemed members
in the commission sitting  So,
Music
what finally is happening on the ground is that
like payment of compensation, punish those who are
the in a way there are six
chairperson and members
who are there in the NHRC place coupled with seven
deemed members in a perform sack it appears as if
the pluralism has been met 
But in practice, this pluralism is not,
very effective, for instance,
the person's belonging to scheduled caste,
scheduled tribes, minorities or even women still feel that there
could have been a better representation in the
violating human rights or other recommendations but then it is
National Human Rights Commission  Let us now turn our attention to the
independence which is again, very important principle,
which is one of the six main principles in the adopted by the
UN General Assembly and what are known as Paris principles 
Why is our independence important?
Music
The NHRC is expected to
adjudicate on important matters without fear or favour 
And it is expected to be independent from the government
and only be responsible to the parliament
left to the sweet will of the authority concerned
to submission of reports etc 
But administratively, it is under the
control of the Ministry of Home Affairs 
So, and the Ministry of Home Affairs also has
wings like left wing extremism, central police organizations,
police and it also has a responsibility to control terrorist violence 
So, there here is contradiction
So in other words, the full functional autonomy,
full financial autonomy, full independence is not
reality for the National Human Rights Commission 
whether they implement the recommendations in four weeks time
On the whole, we have seen that, in 1993,
a body was created through the protection of Human Rights Act
for the better protection of and promotion of Human Rights In India 
Over the past 26 years, it has done
Music
many things for realizing the promise of the
law makers, but there are serious criticisms as well
NHRC is expected to be the guardian of human rights 
But, on the other hand, NGOs
and members of the civil society often hold it as
or eight weeks time or six months or not implemented at all 
toothless tiger 
Only in the years to come we hope that the NHRC will acquire
further strength and all the infirmities which are
there in the protection of Human Rights Act
are plugged and that this body
meets the expectations of the general public 
Thank you 
See you in the next module 
Music
So the commission doesn't have any powers to impose
Welcome to MOOC on Human Rights In India 
fines or hold the officials who are not
implementing the recommendations for contempt 
So he doesn't have a penal powers 
So basically, it depends on the authorities for implementation of the
recommendations made by the commission 
When you talk about
Music
critical evaluation of the National Human Rights Commission 
One needs to bear in mind
section 12 of the Protection of Human Rights Act,
Music
Music
which has given several functions to the commission 
In fact, section 12 mentions a list of areas
or list of functions, which are other words
statutory responsibilities of the commission 
Let us look at the performance of the commission
Against each of the functions which are listed under the
section 12 of the Protection of Human Rights Act 
12(a) talks about complaints redressal, anybody
or a non governmental organization
In this module, we will take up a critical evaluation of the
or sua moto commission can take up
cognizance of a complaint of human rights violations
committed by a public servant  In fact, over the years
the number of complaints received by the commission
has registered a steady increase 
And in fact, there are every year on an average
the commission receives hundred thousand complaints 
Secondly,
Music
you look at the review of loss,
National Human Rights Commission 
which has been entrusted to the commission 
Over the years, the NHRC has reviewed
Music
nearly 50 legislations covering terrorism
Music
covering rights of women, children,
disabilities, manual scavenging
and its own founding statute protection of Human Rights Act
and given substantive recommendations for legal reform 
In fact, some of these have been accepted and implemented 
In the earlier modules we have seen the Paris principles
One particular instance is
is worth noting, that is, namely the 86th constitutional amendment
by which the right to education was made a fundamental right
before that, the NHRC in its successive annual reports
drew attention to the need to
make right to education a fundamental right 
So far as review of laws and other provisions
and our concern the NHRC has acquitted well,
and let's now turn our attention to review of international treaties
and make recommendations 
and also the Protection of Human Rights Act,
The commission reviewed
Music
the torture convention and urged the government of India to sign it 
And as a result of persuasion of the NHRC,
the Government of India signed the UN convention relating to the
torture, cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment or
punishment 1984 but the ratification is still awaited,
the NHRC has been of course advocating for early ratification 
Music
Similarly,
the structure,
when UN adopted
Music
two optional protocols to the Convention on
the Rights of the child, one dealing with child soldiers,
other dealing with children involved in commercial sexual exploitation
or child trafficking, the
Music
government accepted NHRC recommendation and
adopted or
signed and ratified these two optional protocol 
composition functions of the National Human Rights Commission
for the Constitution of a
Music
National Commission for women and
state Commission's for a women in different states
in order to promote the social
and economic development of women and also redress
the grievances of women relating to the deprivation of their right 
The Committee on the status of women
Music
in particular recommended that
structure,
Music
it should be a statutory body
Music
and should be at an autonomous body
with the mandatory powers,
which certain recommendatory powers
in order to be in order to effectively discharge its functions
for protection of womens rights  And that's how
the National Commission for women act was enacted in the 1990 
It came into force
Music
Music
in the month of January 1992 
Thereby establishing a national commission for women under a
statute that is National Commission for the womens act 
Let us look at its mandate: It mandate briefly includes
Music
study of constitutional safeguards, legal safeguards,
and to make recommendations for legislative measures, redress
grievances of women arising from violation of their rights and also
advising various policy measures to government of India
composition of the NCW
or states on issues concerning women 
Let me draw your attention to the graphic
about the functions of the National Commission for women,
which have been provided under the section 10(1) of the
National Commission for woman's Act 
The commission is responsible for number one, studying and monitoring
all matters relating to constitutional and legal safeguards
provided for women  Number two, reviewing the
existing legislations and suggesting amendments, wherever necessary 
Number three looking into complaints and taking suo motu notice
Music
of cases involving deprivation of the rights of women
in order to provide support legal or otherwise to helpless women 
Number four monitoring proper implementation of all legislations
enacted to protect the rights of women to enable them to achieve
equality in all spheres of life and equal participation
in the development of the nation 
And number five, undertaking promotional and educational research
and participating in and advising in the planning process of
socio-economic development of women 
In other words,
What are its functions mandate and what are its powers
Music
the functions under Section 10(1) of the NCW act
educational and supervisory role and duties
in relation to women's rights in India 
Music
Let us now turn our attention to the composition of the
National Commission for women 
According to the founding statute, the commission shall consists of
one chairperson, five members, and a member secretary
and the distinctive characteristics 
in all seven member body  The chairperson is expected to be
a person committed to the cause of women
and with a proven with a strong track record 
and the members in other words, these five members
of the NCW or expected to be again
Music
persons who have a good standing with a proven
experience and expertise in these matters
and then in the relevant areas 
And the member Secretary shall be nominated by the Government of India 
Before we go further,
Let me draw your attention to the
graphic about the current composition of the
National Commission for women as of 1st December 2019 
Mrs  Rekha Sharma is the chairperson of the Commission 
and the members are Smt  Kamlesh Gautam, Smt  Soso Shaiza, ,
Smt  Chandramukhi Devi, Mrs  Shyamala S Kundar,
Dr  Rajulben L Desai and the member secretaries is
Ms  Meenakshi Gupta  
As we have seen the NCW has been given a range of functions
under section 10(1) of the National Commission for women act 
I would like to give you a brief introduction 
I'll draw your attention to the one particular function
relating to complaints redressal 
In fact the commission has been given
the powers of a Civil Court under Section 10(4) of the NCW act,
it can summon people, it can enforce attendance,
it can call for any public record while dealing with
complaints of violation of womens rights,
which have been received by it 
the commission can also take suo motu court decisions
based on media reports 
Music
All these things are done under the complaints
and investigations cell of the commission 
We will see the structure of the commission in greater detail and
how the commission is the work is structured among the different
cells of the commission 
Let me draw your attention to the
graphic about the structure of the National Commission for a women
in particular, its work is distributed across
a number of cells, each of which is responsible for
a particular item of work  Please see the following graphic 
For centuries
Dear Students,
The NCW carries out its function through different cells 
They include complaint and investigation cell,
legal cell, policy monitoring and research cell, NRI cell, North East cell
and there are Suo-Motu cell and there are
other cells dealing with public relations and media management,
psychiatric/custodial homes reform, capacity building,
women safety, women welfare and RTI cell 
Of these cells, the
Music
first three, that is complaint and investigation,
Music
legal and policy monitoring and research cells are
extremely important and critical 
The National Commission for women on an average receives
nearly about 15,000 complaints 
If you see the annual report for 2017-18 
It has received a little over 15,000 complaints 
And these complaints are of various types and the most
important or the largest number of complaints have been under
the groups called right to live with dignity
dowry harassment or cruelty and police apathy
women have suffered discrimination 
to the issues relating to women 
These complaints are entertained by the commission
and then recommendations are made to the appropriate authorities
for redressal of these grievances 
There are certain types of complaints which are not
entertainable by the National Commission for Women 
These include
music
civil disputes, particularly those relating to
non fulfillment of contractual obligations, labour or industrial disputes,
Music
for which there are separate tribunals which takes exist
or any complaint which is sub judice
are any complaint which is illegible, vague, anonymous or pseudonymous,
Music
or any complaint which has been separately considered by
another commission which has been in existence 
Music
The basic idea is that there cannot be
parallel proceedings in two different fora at the same time
in relation to a particular matter 
If you look at their social, economic,
Take, for example, the service matters 
There exists, central administrative tribunals
that exist State Administrative tribunals and which are the
quasi judicial bodies
to deal with complaints relating to service matters 
So those service matters,
which really do not involve any deprivation of
women's rights are not normally entertainable
by the National Commission for a women 
To some up, we have seen the constitutional provisions under
Music
article 14,15 we have also seen a number of specific legislations
which have been adopted, which have been enacted
for the protection of the women's rights and report of the
committee on the status of women in 1974, which recommended
statutory and an autonomous body
and that's how in 1990, the National Commission for Women act was
adopted and it came into force the year 1992 
And a number of functions have been
entrusted to the NCW 
Basically, relating to review of constitutional
political status, they do not enjoy
and legal safeguards and to suggest recommendations for
policy reform or legal reform and also
redress individual grievances and also make recommendations for
to the government on various issues concerning
protection of women's rights 
The NCW has the powers of a civil court
and so this in some is a the National Commission for Women
and as we have seen women have suffered
discrimination for centuries and have not enjoyed equal status
between the social, economic or political realm 
equality on par with men  Often, this discrimination
And there's a long road to travels before formal
gender equality becomes a reality

All these challenges require that there should be

Music
a sound legislative
and institutional framework for protecting the women's rights 
If you look at the Indian Constitution, Article 14 talks about
equality before law, equal protection of laws 
Music
Article 15 further prohibits states from making any distinction or
discriminating between categories of citizens classes
of citizens based on a number of prohibited grounds, which
includes discrimination based on sex, the state
Music
Music
can take special measures for advancing the interests of any
socially or educationally backward classes of citizens 
Music
These constitutional provisions outlined in article 14,15
have been complemented
Music
by the number of womens specific legislations
that have been enacted by the parliament 
These include among others,
The learning objectives for this module are two fold
Music
others, legislations that have been brought out
Music
regarding prohibition of dowry, sati,
Music
immoral trafficking of women in decent representation of woman
or even sexual harassment, domestic violence,
or rape and other sexual violations 
Music
This in a sum provides the overarching, legislative
Music
or legal framework for the protection of women's rights in India
If we look at the International scenario,
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted in the year 1948
And it topped of very profound statement that all
Human Beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, and
the talked of the enjoyment of all rights by men and women
equally and In subsequent years, there was the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that was adopted in the 1966 
And the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights, which again was adopted in the year 1966 
what are the
All these international developments
Music
have led to the Government of India,
constituting a committee to go into these status of women
in India in the year 1971 
Music
This committee after the detailed
examination of the ground realities,
as submitted its report in the year 1974 
And this committee made a important recommendation
Music
The qualifications have not been prescribed 
The vacancies have not been advertised 
But the government nominates the chairperson and members
of the National Commission for women 
Music
The names of the persons proposed to be appointed are in public domain 
It can generate a debate, it can generate a scrutiny 
But if it is not done in a transparent manner,
the political considerations come into play
and people without substantial experience
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted in the year 1948 
at the grassroot level, in the women's rights issues get appointed 
One can only imagine what will be their contribution 
, in other words, it's extremely critical to appoint the right persons,
For discharging this onerous responsibility,
and that's why there's a need for proper selection,
need for proper scrutiny and need to ensure that only the genuine persons
with proven track record of experience in women's issues,
At various levels only get appointed to hold
these very responsible positions , in fact, on the this body,
the expectations of the 50% of women, the women's rights rests 
It proclaimed that all persons are born free
, It's extremely critical to see that the appointment
process is done in a transparent way 
While on this appointment process of chairperson and members,
It's very important to note a few more aspects 
There are no worthwhile consultations with
women's organizations or the civil society 
Music
What happens when there is no such consultation?
The trust deficit increases
between the National Commission for women on the one hand
and equal in dignity and rights, and men and women
and the civil society on the other 
In fact in practice, they both need to work in tandem
to advance women's right  But if there is a gap
between the NCW and the women's organization,
The gender equality movement becomes fragmented,
And it only affects the enjoyment of women's rights 
This non inclusive process also can affect the
Music
autonomy of the Commission in the sense that if a political appointee
will not have the full freedom, to pass an adverse order,
are supposed to enjoy all rights equally 
and so that's why it's a independence and autonomy
are critical to the success this function of the National Commission for women 
There is no coordination between National Commission for women on the one hand
on the state Commissions   state Commissions
are appointed under a separate legislation ideally,
there should be exchange of communication,
Human_rights_in_india_2087
information and also strategies and the Joint Working
between these two bodies
working at the national level and at the state level
This is according the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
that's in the best interests of the women's rights in the country 
, that's why it is very important to have proper
coordination between NCW and the state Commissions
and they insist NCW should be able to take a
leadership role in this process 
Among the Commissions also one comes across
what can be regarded as a hierarchical
nature of the Commissions in their status 
Music
For instance, there's a National Commission for scheduled caste
Which was adopted in the year 1966 
or a National Commission for Scheduled Tribes 
They are constitutional Commissions
and their origin is mentioned in the Constitution 
And the chairpersons of these commissions are equated in
status to that of a Union Cabinet Minister 
You look at National Human Rights Commission 
Music
Its chairperson and members are equated in status
with that of the judges of the Supreme Court of India 
, and in this mileu for the
And again in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,
officials for the government servants, one can easily see the
hierarchical nature of these Commissions and
when the chairperson and members of the National Commission for women,
do not have a high status  It will obviously impact
on the implementation of the day recommendations 
Music
Let's say There is a violation of women's rights,
And if the National Commission for women someone say unofficial
over to Delhi to ascertain facts,
and what if that official doesn't turn up?
which will again or operate in the year 1966 
And so what is the record to open to NCW
to compel the attendance of senior functionaries in the
either in the center or in the States? Currently, there is not much
they can do to compel the attendance 
though they have powers of Civil Court, They obviously need more powers
to compel attendance  Similarly, it can make recommendations,
but it has limited powers for enforcement of these recommendations 
Music
If you look at the National Commission for women's Act 
The Government of India is expected to seek advice
In other words, these three documents, these three instruments
from The National Commission for women but what if the government
of India doesn't accept the NCW's recommendations?
What can NCW you do to enforce its recommendations?
There's hardly anything that NCW can do 
Many years back NCW brought out a black paper 
We normally are aware of the white papers 
But these black paper contained hundreds of recommendations,
which had not been acted upon by the authorities 
,in a way they require additional powers in order to be effective 
And the NCW looked at its own statute made
which I referred constitute the international Bill of Rights 
Dear Students Welcome to a MOOC on Human Rights In India 
or suggested important amendments, but these amendments
are yet to see the light of the day 
, as a result of in practice NCW
comes across as a research body as a recommendatory body 
Though a number of functions have been given to it,
Under the section 10 of the NCW Act That in practice,
It's a recommendatory or a research body 
Music
Having said that, the situation is not entirely bleak 
Over the more than past 25 years, NCW has done a great deal 
They all proclaimed that men and women have
For instance, Mohini Giri, as the chairperson,
has a past chairperson ,brought great visibility to women's issues
without much powers, And they have also initiated many research studies
held parivark mahila local adalats 
but if one needs to See the critiques, and also the achievements,
One can say, it is a mixed record or the glass is half full 
One needs to only see the gap between educational rights of women and men 
Music
The enjoyment of right to health by men and women,
Music
equal rights  In 1979,the UN General Assembly adopted
Work participation by men and women 
Music
There is still a huge gap 
And if you look at the situation of SC woman, ST woman,
Who suffer from double discrimination or that of a
disabled woman or minority woman, it becomes more complex 
here is a body which has the potential
and which needs to be strengthened, Further in order to realize
in order to To promote the social, economic
development of women to protect human rights 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,
Thank you, see you in the Next Module 
Music
and this convention is called CEDAW
was ratified by very high proportion of world's countries 
In fact, 189 countries have signed and ratified it
and assumed all the legal obligations flowing from it 
India also is a state party to the
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,
And if you see, in 1970s, there was a feminist movement
In this module, we take up the second part dealing with
and in 1975, the UN General Assembly
decided to declare it as a International Year of the women 
And in the same year, there was a World Conference was organized or in Mexico
on the issue of women's rights 
And at the end of which there was a program of action was adopted 
And in that program of action, there was a clear message,
there was a encouragement to all states
to create national and autonomous bodies
for looking after the women's issues, looking after women's rights 
And, in addition, the United Nations has also declared,
the National Commission for women   In particular,
The decade starting from 1976 to 1985
As the UN decade for woman  and if you look at the Indian scenario,
India was of course influenced by all these international developments 
It participated in all these developments at
the UN as a member of the UN General Assembly 
And it's own committee on the status of women in India
submitted a path breaking , ground breaking report
with a series of recommendations urging government of India,
To constitutea national level, statutoryautonomous body
known as National Commission for women to promote the social
we will see whether there is any critique of the
and economic development of women and also redress
the grievances of women arising out of the violation of their rights 
In other words, the National Commission for women did not
come out of any vacuum  There was a series of developments,
right from 1948 onwards  there was a movement
feminist movement, and which resulted ultimately
in the establishment of a national commission for women in the year 1992 
Under the legislation that was adopted in the year 1990 
, let us turn our attention to the critique of the Commission 
How did it act itself? It has completed now more than 25 years 
National Commission for women's functioning
, in the 25 years, has it gone far enough?
What has been it's achievements, what have been it's failures
and let's look at the critiques that have emerged
right from its inception For a body to be effective,
it needs to have a number of things,A:
it needs to have full financial resources at its disposal 
, let us look at the kind of budgets,
which have been or grants which have been given to this body 
They always hovered around 18 crore to a little over 20 crores 
See the, India we have about 130 crore population
and how can it be made more effective body 
and women hold Half the Sky and for 50% of the population,
You allocate a meager sum of us 20 crores
and if you really take it as a per capita terms it boxes a miniscule 
you cannot really have a national body, give it a number of functions
and expect it to discharge all those functions without giving it,
an adequate budget and in addition to financial resources,
Human Resources are again very important  Right from the beginning,
The Commission has been asking for
more and more staff in order to perform its assigned functions,
Its statutory responsibilities 
Before we go further, let us briefly recall the
, let us turn our attention to another important aspect,
namely the role of the Ministry of women and child development 
Though, in CW is expected to be
an autonomous body, yet it is administratively tied to the
Ministry of women and child development for all its requirements,
be it staff, be it funds, be it sanction of administrative post,
It has to run to the Ministry of women and child development 
We have to see this in the backdrop of autonomous culture 
In fact, institutions can flourish, where there is a genuine respect
for autonomy among everyone, but it's not so in practice 
what has gone on before behind the creation of the
One body like this needs the full functional, operational
and financial autonomy in order to discharge the mandate given to it
By the parliamentarians, by the law makers 
Music
Each of these aspects,functional, operational and financial autonomy
is critical to such bodies  Let's turn our attention to
yet another important aspect namely, the composition of the Commission
and the manner of appointment of chairperson and members 
Women's groups have always held out that
this entire process is a non transparent one 
National Commission for women  In fact, as you know,
,I draw your attention to number three,
the National Commission for scheduled caste shall participate
and advice in the planning process of socio economic development of the
scheduled caste and to evaluate

Class four, it says to present to the president annually
and at such other times, as the commission may deem fit, reports on the
working of these safeguards 
Number five, to make in such reports,
in which the National Commission for scheduled caste was established 
recommendations as to the measures that should be taken
by the union or any state for the effective implementation of
Those safeguards and other measures for the protection,
Welfare and socio economic development of the scheduled caste 
And you can see the function listed under
item number six  basically, if you look at the items from one to six 
One can find that the national Commission's role
is essentially as follows 
Music
It has a role, which is advisory,

of Article 338 
The Union Government and every state government
is required to consult the National Commission for scheduled caste,
If you look, the scheduled caste
On all major policy matters affecting scheduled castes 
For the functions which are outlined in Article 338 of the Constitution,
The National Commission for scheduled castes has been vested
with the powers of a civil court

investigation of the constitutional safeguards,
or other safeguards or inquiry into complaints 
The Commission can summon any person
Music
summon any public document or record and record affidavits
on owth and do a number of measures for discharging,
the responsibilities entrusted to it,
Under the Constitution  one can see that
the National Commission for scheduled caste
has been given a range of powers under Article 338
and it has also been given such an powers 
And in pursuance the Commission has been conducting
various activities, and which are all reported
in its annual reports, which are submitted from time to time
figure in the lowest rung of the social ladder in the social hierarchy
to the President of India, which include visits to states,
visits to jails and other institution,
review meetings with public sector undertakings,
or review of laws, regulations, and policies
and so on and so forth  ,
let us turn our attention to this aspect of how can the
National Commission for scheduled caste be made
more effective The Commission has been
highlighting certain inadequacies to the government from time to time 
For instance, the budget that has been allocated
and suffered practices like untouchability for many centuries
to the commission isn't sufficient enough 
If you look at a few years back annual report of 2015-16,
It says that a sum of nearly 15 crore
was allocated to the National Commission for scheduled caste 
And after accounting for salaries or other committed expenditure,
a paltry sum of rupees three crore is left for the the commission,
which isn't far enough  And considering the
magnitude of the issue ,considering the enormity of the
problems ,considering the gap between the constitutionally guaranteed rights
and its practice or its realization at the ground level,
Music
The Commission needs far more financial resources 
The Commission doesn't have a separate budget head 
In fact, it is tied to the Ministry of Social Justice and empowerment,
and the funds for the National Commission for the scheduled caste
are given as a part of the ,
the Ministry of Social Justice and empowerment  Commission also doesn't have
power to engage consultants 
manpower on a short term contract basis 
Music
All of this affects the functioning of the Commission 
and they face discrimination
In fact, for a body to be really effective,
it needs functional autonomy, operational autonomy,administrative autonomy,
and the Commission has made a series of recommendations towards this end
and hopefully, the times to come,
It should get better and better and Secondly,
the commission also found that there are
a number of other practical issues which affect it's functioning 
For instance,
Music
the powers of a civil court, it can summon officials
Music
be it from the central government or from the state governments or
from the public sector undertakings 
Enforce their attendance, ask for any public documents records,
but it cannot issue injunctions 
Music
The Commission feels that it is constrained because at times,
, keeping it as a recommendatory body
and keeping in view that there are investigation
or the inquiry into complaints require remedial action
and redressal of grievances There's a need for the Commission's
and it has manifested in a number of ways, including in their access to
Dear students welcome to MOOC on Human Rights In India 
words to make its recommendations binding 
,in other words,it has asked for the amendment to its powers 
in order to invest to the greater powers,
particularly the power of a civil court,
and to enable it to give a binding orders 
In summary, or In conclusion,
we have seen the historical background to the creation of a
national commission for scheduled caste 
We saw how centuries of discrimination has impoverished
the persons belonging to scheduled caste,
let us say temples, Wells, public places and also led to
and there affected their social status, economic status,
political status, and left a gap
between them and the general population 
And we also see the institutional framework
for the protection of the scheduled caste,
Which evolved over a period of time from 1950,
starting with the commissioner for scheduled caste,
Which was subsequently made into a multi member commission,
and then rechristened as a national commission
for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes,
severe violations like killings, assault, rape, etc 
and how it was bifurcated in the year 2004
as a separate commission for national Scheduled Castes,
and a separate National Commission for shedule tribes 
And we also seen a range of functions entrusted to the commission to
supervise the monitoring of the constitutional safeguards,
other legislative safeguards  In fact, a number of legislations
in this connection have been enacted by the Parliament of India 
For instance, right from 1955 protection of Civil Rights Act,and subs 
Thereafter, you know there were many The Land Reform Act,
Which came in and there was a prevention of atrocities
In fact, If you look at the enjoyment of
against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act,
Which was done in the year 1989,
And rules were framed there under 
And this Act, called atrocities Act was amended in 2015 
And again, rules were framed under the amended Act 
The Commission is expected to monitor the implementation of the
constitutional safeguards, Which basically fall under several hits 
There are in fact, social safeguards, There are economic safeguards,
There are political safeguards, and there are educational and cultural safeguards,
And there are service safeguards 
rights by persons belonging to the sheduled castes 
If you look at the Constitution of India
and the affirmative action that it proposes to achieve
is unparalleled anywhere else in the world
and the size and scale of the reservations in
education and in employment is truly unparalleled 
Yet there is still a huge gap between the general population
and the scheduled caste in many areas 
, they have got as a result of reservations,certain political status,
but as regards the social and economic status, there is still a long way to go 
And, though the National Commission for scheduled caste has been given
You will find that there is a gap between SC's on the one hand
a range of functions and also powers 
It suffers from a number of inadequacies,
particularly shortage of financial resources, or manpower resources,
and it also needs more powers in order to be
truly effective in order to be a guardian of the
protector of the Rights of Persons belonging to scheduled caste 
Thank you  See you in the next module 
Music
and the general population on the other
with regard to the enjoyment of right to education,
right to health, right to food, right to clean drinking water, right to livelihood 
And these are important human rights issues indeed 
And if you look at the situation of
In the course of this module and the coming module 
Music
scheduled caste women it is much worse,
and they suffer double discrimination on account of
belonging to the scheduled caste and being a women 
In fact, if one examines
Music
the number of people who are engaged in practices like
child labor, bonded labor and manual scavenging,
You will find that a high proportion of
people belong to persons from scheduled caste 
We will look at the National Commission for scheduled caste 
, all these historical wrongs
Music
have led to a serious violations 
And that's why the framers of the Constitution of India
have we know
Music
provided special measures for the advancement of
socially and economically Backward Classes including SC's 
Music
As you know from the preamble of The Constitution,
The learning objectives for this module are two fold 
It talks about social justice, economic justice, political justice,
and after the constitution came into being in the year 1950
came into force in 1950,
a need for a
Music
specialized institutional framework was felt, for the monitoring the
legislative constitutional safeguards for persons belonging to the sheduled caste 
And thus how,
Music
in 1950 itself,
One, we will see the historical background for the
Music
a commissioner for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was appointed
and subsequently,
Music
a need was felt for making this as a multi member commission 
Music
And that's how in 1978
Music
the commissioner for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes gave way to a
commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
setting up of the National Commission for scheduled caste,
and in the year 1990 through a constitutional amendment,
Music
It was renamed as the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes 
And in 2004, again through another constitutional amendment,
namely the 89th amendment 
The National Commission for scheduled caste was separated from the
National Commission for scheduled tribes 
In other words, the National Commission for scheduled caste
is a constitutional body it's an authority which derives its source
it derives it's mandate from the Constitution of India 
and we'll also look at its mandate functions and powers 
Unlike statutory bodies, which are set up under an Act of Parliament,
I draw your attention to the diagram 
Please look at the following diagram for the functions of the
National Commission for scheduled caste 
Article 338 Class five says that
National Commission for scheduled caste shall number one,
investigate and monitor all matters relating to the safeguards
provided for the SC's Under this constitution,
or under any other law for the time being in force,
Secondly, we will examine how can this body be made made more effective 
or under any order of the government,
and to evaluate the working of such safeguards 
, the operating words are to investigate and monitor
and also evaluate the working of constitutional and other legal safeguards 
Number two, to inquire into specific complaints
with respect to the deprivation of rights and safeguards of the Scheduled Castes 
It's these two functions mentioned in
, class five, one and two are extremely important,
because the National Commission for schedules caste has also been given
the powers of a civil court with regard to the exercise of these two functions 
, let us look at the historical context
and adequate investigative machinery 
So these Paris principles are quite critical for the functioning of
any National Human Rights institution, including in NHRC
and also for the National Commission for protection of child rights 
Dear students, now let us look at the composition
of the NCPCR under the commission for protection of
Child Rights Act 
The Commission consists of a one chairperson, and seven members 
The chairperson is expected to be
a person of great eminence with outstanding work the
education act or POCSO that is protection of children from
issues relating to protection of children  The six members are
expected to be selected from experts who have
child psychology, juvenile justice, child labour,
and in last relating the children and a number of other areas 
In other words, this is expected to be a high profile
commission and these chairperson and members are nominated by the
Government of India 
At as far as the functions of the National Commission for
protection of child rights is concerned, these
sexual offences act 
have been specified in section 13 of the commission for the
protection of child rights acts  At this act interest the
commission with a number of statutory responsibilities 
In fact, I draw your attention to the graphic, which follows as
regards the multiple functions which have been assigned to the NCPCR 
As you can see, the commission reviews the
safeguards provided by or under any law for the protection of
child rights the presents to central government annually reports
relating to the safeguards  Inquiry into violation of child rights
examine all factors that inhibit enjoyment of rights of
Music
children affected by terrorism, communal violence, riots,
natural disaster, domestic violence, HIV/AIDS, trafficking,
maltreatment, torture and exploitation, pornography and
prostitution and recommend appropriate remedial measures 
In fact, these themes will give you and sufficient idea about the
issues concerning child rights violation  In addition, the
commission also looks into matters relating to children in
need of special care and protection including children
in distress, marginalized and disadvantage children,
children in conflict with law, juvenile children without family and
Children by virtue of their
children of prisoners and recommend appropriate remedial
measures  The NCPCR also is expected to study 3ds and
other international instruments and make recommendations
undertake and promote research in the field of child rights,
spread child rights literacy, inspect juvenile homes and other
such homes where children are kept and make recommendations 
Section 13(1) J is an important provision regarding inquiry into
complaints relating to violation of child rights 
So if you look at the commission
is expected to walk on several legs and it
strength by virtue of their level of maturity,
enjoys a wide mandate in terms of its function, encompassing
advisory role, reporting, investigative, evaluative, remedial,
educational and supervisory duties in relation
to child rights in India  In so far as inquiry into
individual complaints of child rights violation is
concerned, the commission has the powers of a civil court 
It can summon any official, it can ask for any public document 
It can seek any report, it can examine people on both, record
evidence and affidavits  And infact the National Commission
for protection of child rights assumes
or vulnerable for various forms of exploitation
Music
different roles under the
Music
commission for protection of child rights or under the right to
education act or under the
Music
protection of children from
sexual offences act 
Now let us look at the POCSO act of, 2012 
and they need special care and protection
Music
act specifically provides that the commission
shall monitor designation of special courts by various state governments 
And also the appointment of public prosecutors
in these courts for trying

various violations of change rights
Music
  issue of guidelines, training modules, spreading
awareness through media and are calling for individual reports
keeping this in view the constitution of India as a
on any specific issue involving violation of child rights or
assess the implementation of the POCSO act in general
and make recommendations 
The act also asks the NCPCR to collect data from various state
governments and other authorities on the manner of
implementation of the POCSO act  Let us now turn our attention to
the right of children for free and compulsory education act or
what is known as RTE act  Now, under this act, the commission
has a twin role one is to monitor the safeguards provided
under the RTE act for the education of children and
number of provisions for the protection of children through a
secondly, to inquire into individual complaints of
violation of the deprivation of the right to education of children
under the RTE act 
Music
If you see the Juvenile Justice Act, it also requires the NCPCR
to monitor the implementation of the juvenile justice care and
protection of children act and also visit custodial homes,
juvenile homes where children are held for reformation and to
suggest improvement to the conditions there in 
In conclusion, we see that a range of
constitutional amendment, article 21 dealing with right to
Dear students,
safeguards have been provided
under the constitution, specific legislations, regulations and
policies for the healthy development and growth of
children and for the protection of their rights
and under the
commission, for the protection of child rights act NCPCR was
constituted in 2007 with the commission consists of a one
chairperson and seven member  It has been given range of
functions under the section 13, one of the CPCR act and the
commission enjoys the powers of a civil court 
life and personal liberty was amended to article 21A was
And you have also seen how the commission assumes
different roles under the POCSO act,
or under the RTE act or under the JJ act  
Dear students there is a big gap between
the legislative promise as contained
in the constitutional safeguards, specific legislative safeguards
and the ground realities 
And so these national commission for protection of child rights
is expected bridge that gap are expected to see that
children enjoy a wonderful environment where there
inserted which requires the state to provide free and
they can develop in conditions of freedom and dignity 
And in the coming module we will see the critical evaluation
of the working of the National Commission for protection of child rights 
Thank you and see you in the next module 
Music
compulsory education to all children in the age group of 6 to 14 years 
In addition to the article 21 A article 23 of the
constitution prohibits trafficking in Human Beings and also forced labour 
And article 24 of the Constitution prohibits
employment of children in factories, mines and any other
hazardous occupations 
Music
These three articles 21 A, 23 and 24, are in the part 3
Welcome to MOOC on Human Rights In India over a
of the constitution dealing with the fundamental rights 
And you take up part four of the
constitution dealing with the
directive principles of state policy article 39(f) 
In particular provides that children should be given
opportunities and other conditions into enable them to develop
in a healthy manner in conditions of freedom and dignity 
So, these constitutional provisions have been supplemented by
a number of specific legislations 
For instance,
course of this module and the coming module, we will look at
there is this prohibitation of child marriage act, 2006 and
Music
there is a child labour prohibition and Regulation Act of 1986,
which was amended in 2016 
And there is this immoral traffic act,
there is a pre-conception pre-natal diagnostic act, which
seeks to prohibit female feticide
and there are a number of other legislations which deal with
protection of the rights of children to take for instance,
right of children for free and compulsory education act,
the National Commission for protection of child rights 
which is called RTE act in short  And as I said earlier on, there was
a protection of children from sexual offences act 
And then there is this juvenile justice,
care and protection of children act 
Music
And there are other legislations as well 
If you look at the Indian Penal code, the criminal procedure Code,
there are provisions which are child friendly
and which seek to protect the rights of children 
These constitutional provisions, legislations have been
In particular, we will see what is the constitutional and
further supplemented by regulations 
For instance, there were adoption regulations 
There was a national plan of action, which was you know the early 2000 
It was enacted and it was further sub replaced with
more improved version of the national plan of action 
There was a national charter, National Children's policy 
In fact, the National Plan of Action had a range of goals and strategies
and in order to achieve those goals and strategies, the talked
about the setting up of a national commission for
protection of child rights and state commission's in various
legislative framework for the protection of child rights 
states for the protection of child rights 
Under these bodies be given sufficient autonomy
so that they can uphold child rights 
We have seen the domestic provisions in the form
of constitutional safeguards, legislative safeguards and also
policies and other regulations  If you turn your attention to
the international standards, the UN general assembly adopted the
convention on the rights of the child in the year 1989, which
came into force in 1991 
And in India, in fact, adopted India
What is the composition of the NCPCR and what are its
adopted in the year 1992 and India also signed and ratified
two optional protocols to the convention on the rights of the children 
If you look at the convention on the rights of the child 
There are a number of principles particularly which
seek to uphold children's rights to life, survival and
protection, non discrimination, best interests of the children
and participation  And these principles are also incorporated
in our domestic policies and plans of action by India 
The commission for protection of child rights act was adopted by
functions  In particular we will see what are its functions
National Commission for protection of child rights was
established in the year 2007  The non governmental
organizations and civil society hold that NCPCR by its very
character is like a National Human Rights institution 
And they therefore argue that it should confirm to Paris
principles, which as you have seen in the earlier modules,
talk about a wide mandate for the commission and also how it
should have pluralism, how we should enjoy autonomy from
government, how it should be independent for effective functioning,
how this body should be invested with adequate resources,
in relation to other specific legislations like right to
Persons with disabilities act 1995 was an important advance as it
it sought to protect the rights of persons with disabilities 
It had a focus on the rights  Yet a number of critics say that
it provided government with many escape routes, as it limited
the enjoyment of many provisions to the economic capacity of the state
or the development of the state 
And the presence of prevention and the early detection chapter,
in the persons with disabilities will also
not like it by the disabled activists 
Music
It's called rights of persons with disabilities act 2016 
It was introduced in the parliament in 2014 
And after due deliberation after due legislative process,
it was adopted  Before we go to the rights of persons
disabilities act, it's very important to see the international context 
In fact, at the international level two there had been
many attempts at the UN General Assembly 
Which started with several non binding declarations or standards for
instance, there were declarations dealing with rights of disabled persons
or rights of mentally ill persons and these number of declarations
If you see in general, in one finds that
dealing with several categories of disabled persons
eventually led to the adoption of a UN Convention
on the rights of persons with disabilities 
In the year 2006 India signed and ratified the UN Convention
of the rights of persons with disabilities 
India did not sign the optional protocol to the
convention of the rights of persons to disabilities 
Here this convention again marked a big shift
in the way, disability was perceived in the way disability was understood 
It focused not so much on the physical or a
the persons with disabilities face
impairment per se, but it looked at the social and other barriers
which prevented on the full enjoyment of rights on par with the others 
So, here is a very interesting and very different definition of
disability that has been brought in by the UN convention on the
rights of persons with disabilities, which has in turn inspired
developments at the national level also,
as India signed and ratified the UN Convention on the
rights of persons with disabilities,
there was a need for Indian Government to harmonize
the current legislations with the requirements of the UN Convention,
discrimination, exclusion, marginalization as a result of
and that in the process rights of persons
with disabilities was adopted in the year 2016 
Dear students, we were trying to unravel the legal framework
for the protection of the rights of persons with disabilities 
We examined the constitutional provisions, we also saw the
provisions in the persons with disabilities act of 1995 
Now, let us take up the rights of persons with disabilities act of 2016 
In fact, as you know, India ratified the UN convention
on the rights of persons with disabilities in the year 2007,
which required that all existing laws must be harmonized
which they're unable to enjoy all human rights on par with others 
with the requirements of the UN convention on the rights of
persons with disabilities and that's
how this new act was enacted in the year 2016
and to replace the 1995 act 
Here, the number of disabilities have been increased from 7 to 21 
They also include currently, things like thalassemia, haemophilia,
acid attacks and disability arising from
muscular dystrophy, intellectual or learning disabilities,
and Parkinson's disease 
So it's a very good this thing earlier in 1995 act
Music
up these seven disabilities included the locomotor
or orthopedically challange,
visual challenge and hearing challenge and such and
these have been expanded significantly and to 21 in fact in
the rights of persons with disabilities act of 2016 if you look at
the section two, there are several definitions given there
and a barrier has been defined as any
hurdle any, let's say cultural, social, physical and other
hurdle which affects the ability of a persons with disability from
enjoying rights on par with other Human Beings 
There exists
So, barrier has been defined and discrimination term also has
been defined under section 2 as to include any
distinction, restriction, which affects
the enjoyment of a full range of human rights
civil, political, economic, social, cultural,
of a person with disability, on par with others 
Section 2 further defines a person with disability
as one who has a physical hearing, visual or sensory impairment
which, in conjunction with the barriers affects the full
participation of a person with disability on par with the
Music
others  And now this definition in the 2016 act
takes inspiration from the UN convention  Here the focus is
not so much on the impairment per se 
The focus is the, on the impairment
and its conjunction with the barriers
which affect the full participation of persons with disability
in all walks of life 
And so the reason is, there should be
full participation of persons with disabilities
in all walks of life  Now, if you look at
serious physical, mental, environmental, attitudinal,
section 32 of the rights of persons with disabilities act of 2016 
It seeks to reserve not less than 5% of seats in
higher educational institutions Government higher educational institutions
are funded by the government 
And these 5% includes
for those with the benchmark disabilities 
Section 34 of the rights of persons with disabilities act
further reserves 4% of jobs in government sector,
out of which 1% shall be for those
with blindness or low vision,
cultural barriers to the effective participation of
Dear students, welcome to MOOC on Human Rights In India 
and 1% shall be for locomotor disabilities,
which includes cerebral palsy, which include muscular dystrophy,
acid attacks, dwarfism and 1% for hearing impaired
or deaf out of this 4% reservation for jobs in the government sector 
1% is to be reserved for those belonging to
autism, mental illness, intellectual disability,
or multiple disabilities  So, 2016 act
which seeks to give effect to the provisions of the
UN convention on the rights of persons with disabilities is a
important advance in the legislative framework 
persons with disabilities in all walks of life, as a result of
Now let us look at other legislations dealing with the rights of
persons with disabilities  We have a national trust
for welfare of persons affected by autism, cerebral palsy,
mental retardation, and multiple disabilities of 1999 
This act arose from the demands of family members
for an effective arrangement of guardianship 
In fact, this national trust act provides for
the appointment of local level committees and also
has elaborate provisions for the appointment of guardians
on there functions 
which they become relegated to the, as a second class citizens
Mental Health act 2017 is yet another important legislation,
it's seeks to amend modify the Mental Health Act of 1987 
And also harmonize the mental health legislation
with the requirements of the UN Convention
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities that was adopted
ratified in the year 2007  This Mental Health Act of 2017
defines mental illness and also tries to provide for the
treatment, care of mentally ill persons 
It decriminalizes suicide and says that a person who has attempted to
commit suicide shall be given proper treatment and care,
unable to enjoy the full gamut of human rights 
so that he can be rehabilitated, and he should not be punished
for the attempt to commit suicide 
And it recognizes that person as a person
who has undergone stress and as a person who
requires treatment 
Chapter five of the mental health act of 2017
outlines the rights of persons with disabilities and in
particular right to access mental health care, mental health services
in institutions run by government,
in hospitals run by government and also it also specifies
This is a very serious human rights issue indeed 
the quality of such treatment and that should be affordable
and it should be of a particular quality and, and it should be
made available to all including those who are below the poverty line 
If you look at the person's mental illness, they
suffered from stigmatization, the moment a person is branded as
a mentally ill person  Society tends to discriminate
them and their members of their families 
And that's why the confidentiality is an extremely critical for
persons with disabilities  And the mental health act therefore,
has provisions to ensure that the information relating to the
In fact, the persons with disabilities have organized themselves
treatment either mental health treatment or physical treatment
taken by persons with mental illness shall not be disclosed,
or their photographs shall not be release through the
media without the consent of the persons who are affected 
Now, section five also has a provision for an advance directive by
a person who is affected by mental illness, in that
that person who is not a minor can specify the manner in which
he or she can be treated, and in collaboration with the
mental health board, and this directive has to be supported by
an authorized medical doctor and the
and their families have organized and the NGOs the civil society movement
authorized mental health board  Let us see
the way a mentally ill person is treated oftentimes up 
electro-convulsive therapy or ECT is administered to mentally ill person
with a view to cure them  The Mental Health Act of 2017
prescribes that no electro convulsive therapy shall be used on
minors and for others, whenever it has to be used,
it shall be used along with muscle relaxants,
and after administering and anesthesia The Mental Health Act of 2017
solitary environment or in seclusion or they shall not be
have put pressure and have been responsible for changes in the
restrained shall not be used them unless they are absolutely necessary 
There was one case which went to the Supreme Court of India,
that was by the Sheela Barse she brought to the attention of the court
to the plight of the non criminal, mentally ill persons
who were often held in jails  And the Supreme Court held that
this practice is totally unconstitutional and illegal 
So no non criminal, mentally ill persons can be held in jails 
And if you look at the practice, like though
the mental health the act says that the
persons with mental illness shall not be held in
legal framework and evolution of a series of standards
restraints unless it is absolutely necessary 
There was a massive fire tragedy in the Erwadi in Tamil Nadu
where 26 mentally ill persons who were chained to their beds
died in a fire tragedy  And in wake of that
the National Human Rights Commission asked all the state governments to
certify that no mentally ill persons are chained to their
beds or held in such conditions 
There is a rehabilitation Council of India act of 1996 
Which seeks to regulate the way special education programs,
the way training programs and other programs for
at the international level 
rehabilitation of persons with disabilities can be conducted 
We have seen a number of legislations
for the rights of persons with disabilities 
They have been complemented by policies at the
central level and the state level as well 
If you look at the central level, there is a disability policy 
There is a national policy on mental health and
in addition to these legislative safeguards and
constitutional safeguards, there are other safeguards at
the international level, which are of two types 
And today, we find that there is a paradigm shift
Over the course of this module and the coming module, we will look at
They is a non binding standards by way of
declarations by way of the UN general assembly self as
adopted a number of declarations for the mentally retarded persons
or for personal disability or mental illness 
And there was a Biwako Millennium Framework 
There's a UN decade, our Asia Pacific decade
and there is a world programme of action,
all of them constitute non binding standards, which are
supposed to guide the conduct of the states 
And as far as some binding standards are concerned,
from a welfare based approach to a human rights based approach
there is this UN Convention on the rights of persons
with disabilities that was adopted by the UN general assembly
in the year 2006 and which of course, India ratified in the year 2007 
In conclusion, we have covered the provisions
in the domestic legislations as well as the international norms
for protecting the rights of persons with disabilities 
What is required in practice is a strick implementation,
scrupulous adherence to these provisions and they need to be
viewed as barriers of rights not as objects of charity or pity 
Thank you  See you in the next module 
to the problems faced by persons with disabilities 
Music
Now, let us turn our attention to the constitutional safeguards
or the legislative safeguards for the
persons with disabilities in India 
Article 14 of the constitution talks about
right to equality and equal protection of laws 
Article 15 and 16
prohibit discrimination based on sex,
race, caste, religion, place of birth, or any of them 
the rights of persons with disabilities and the
And if you look at the Directive Principles of state policy,
Article 41 talks about the special efforts to be taken by the state
to secure right to work, right to education
in case of unemployment, in case of persons with old age,
persons who are sick and in case of disablement 
So, we find that the word disable does not figure
in the part three of the constitution dealing with fundamental rights,
but in the directive principles of state policy,
it figures that states shall take special measures, in
cases of disablement subject of course, to the limits of
institutional framework for protecting their rights 
economic capacity, subject of course, to the limits of
development of the state 
When the constitution was drafted
Music
there was a recognition of the
social disability on account of discrimination suffered by
persons belonging to schedule caste, particularly in their
access to temples in their access to waiting guards,
drinking water and other public places 
But there was no recognition,
In this module, there are two objectives: One, we seek to
no proper appreciation of the plight of the
the persons with disabilities  But the Indian courts had been
at the forefront of an expansive interpretation of judicial interpretation
of various rights in the constitution of India 
In Nandakumar Narayanrao Ghodmare versus state of Maharashtra 
The Supreme Court ordered that a candidate
who was rejected from employment on the grounds that
he is a colorblind person was set aside and
the court order that he should be employed in one of the post 
There are in fact, there were 35 posts for which
understand the legislative framework for the protection of
five alone required a perfect vision and the supreme court said
the remaining 30 posts which do not really require
perfect vision, he should be appointed 
it was quite a progressive interpretation
by the apex court in 1995 
<Insurt new tag time 6:30 to 6:32> Persons with disabilities act was enacted
after a lot of struggle by the persons with disabilities
and their organizations 
In fact, this item figures in the state list, but there was a
proclamation at the international level,
the rights of persons with disabilities 
about the decade for persons with disabilities and
this observance at the international level, and this
international declaration enabled the Government of India
to bring in legislation called persons with disabilities and
the full title of the act goes like this 
And it talks about equal opportunities, protection of rights
and full participation act 
In fact, the objectives of this legislation are two fold,
to enable the persons with disabilities to enjoy many rights
on equal basis with others, particularly the social
And secondly, what are the international standards
and economic rights and also their full participation in
various activities of the society 
The persons with disabilities act identifies seven types of disabilities
and the model adopted here is one of a medical model and not
the social perception of disabilities 
And there are several chapters in the Persons with Disabilities Act,
which deal with non discrimination,
which deal with affirmative action, which deal with right to education,
employment and prevention and early detection,
and also persons with severe disabilities 
which seek to protect the rights of persons with disabilities 
people who are persons with disabilities can bring
individual complaints into the office of the chief commissioner
or the chief commissioner himself or herself, based on
media reports can take cognizance of the violation of
the rights of persons with disabilities and initiate action 
In addition, section 75 (c)
Music
requires the office of the chief commissioner to review
safeguards provided by or under persons with disabilities Act or
any other law for the protection of the rights of persons with
and what are the functions of the CCPWD
disabilities and recommend measures for the effective
implementation 
75 (d) requires the chief commissioner
to review factors that inhibit the enjoyment of rights of
persons with disabilities and recommend appropriate remedial measures 
The chief commissioner is also expected to study
treaties and other international instruments on the rights of
persons with disabilities and make recommendations for their
effective implementation 
In the last module, we saw the
And what are the key achievements
provisions of the convention on the rights of persons with
disabilities and also saw that there are a number of non
binding standards at the international level 
The chief commissioner is expected to undertake and promote research
in the field of rights of persons with disabilities 
Promote awareness of the rights of persons with disabilities,
and safeguards,
monitor implementation of the provisions of the 2016 Act,
and also schemes, programmes meant for persons with disabilities
and also monitor utilization of funds
of the of Chief Commissioner  in India
dispersed by the central government for the benefit of
persons with disabilities  And also perform such other
functions as the central government may assign 
Thus, we see that
Music
there was a need for a
robust institutional framework
to complement the legislative framework 
And that's how the 2016 rights of persons with disabilities Act
provided for the institution of a Office of the Chief Commissioner for
Music
persons with disabilities and section 75 of the 2016 rights of
persons with disabilities Act provided for a range of
functions and number of statutory functions to this office 
And one such function is that of inquiry into individual
complaints of violation of the rights of persons with disabilities 
In fact, the chief commissioner on his own
initiative without any complaint from any affected
individual or non governmental organization or family can
initiate action against such government authorities, such
government offices or statutory bodies, which are not
census 2011
implementing the protective provisions of the 2016 Act 
When the chief commissioner initiates an inquiry, he is vested with
the powers of a civil court 
In fact, these proceedings are kind of a quasi judicial proceedings 
He or the chief commissioner can summon people
ask for any public record and take a evidence on affidavits on
oath and make recommendations for the effective redressal of
these individual complaints  , let us take up few key
achievements made by this office of the chief commissioner for
persons with disabilities  There are a number of important
identified that there were nearly 2 68 crore persons with
interventions made by the office of the chief commissioner for
persons with disabilities 
And if you look at the achievements of this office they
can be categorized under a few groups 
One, he contributed significantly to the strengthening of the official
machinery for the protection of the rights of persons with disabilities 
He advocated with the state governments for
appointment of state commissioners pursuant to the
advocacy of the chief commissioner many states have
appointed the state level mechanisms, state level
disabilities, who constituted nearly 2 21% of the total population 
institutional frameworks and thereafter the chief
commissioner had annual meetings with these state commissioners,
all of which contributed to the monitoring the implementation of
the rights of persons with disabilities 
Following his advocacy, many states have designated collectors of
districts as deputy or additional commissioners in
charge of disabilities and they also constituted medical boards
for issue of disability certificates 
The chief Commissioner took up with the
chief secretaries of various states
The government has come out with a more sensitive
and union territories on the need for issue of disability
certificates and streamlining this process on the whole 
Secondly, access is a major challenge for persons with disabilities 
the office of the chief commissioner
conducted many access audits of public places like airports,
railway stations, bus stands, banks, post offices, hospitals,
and other such places of public use
and looked at it from the
angle of persons with disabilities and those who have
physical challenges, those who have other challenges and in
phraseology by way of terming them as persons with special
terms of access of displays and made recommendations for
removing the various barriers to these places, and all of it has
led to a significant improvement in the access of public places 
Third is awareness generation: The chief commissioner conducted
many national level workshops on inclusive education and
employment and give wide publicity to the mandatory
provisions for the appointment of persons with disabilities and
also the authorities responsibilities for reservation, etc 
And you also produced booklets 
The chief Commissioner also
abilities or divyangjan  In fact,
Dear students, Welcome to MOOC on Human Rights In India 
organized a number of initiatives for skill
development of persons with disabilities 
The fourth major item is that of grievance redressal 
In fact, a person with disability can send a complaint
about the violation of his or her rights, along with
his disability certificate and the chief commissioner's office
working as a civil court is expected to complete the
redressal of the complaint within three months from the
date of receipts and thousands of such complaints had been
redressed in the past decade or to and they are of various types 
the non governmental organizations, disability activists hold that
They include service matters like top postings, transfers,
they include reservation in educational institutions
or extra time required for writing examinations etc 
And a list of such illustrate cases have been given in this
module and they give a
student view about the
practical difficulties faced by persons with disabilities in day
to day affairs 
And so this grievance redressal machinery
is an extremely important role for the office of the chief
the actual number of persons with disabilities could be much higher 
commissioner for persons with disabilities 
In conclusion, there are significant physical, mental,
cultural, social, attitudinal, and other barriers
faced by persons with disabilities 
And the discrimination is also fact of reality and though
there exists legal safeguards there exist constitutional
safeguards, though there exists protective provisions in the
rights of persons with disabilities act 
What is required is vigorous implementation and by the
chief commissioner and various state commissioners before these

and in the last module, we reviewed
Music
the legal framework for the
protection of the rights of persons with disabilities in detail 
, we need a machinery, we need a mechanism to see that
music
all the provisions in these legislations are
effectively enforced at the ground level and that the
persons will disabilities are able to enjoy the full range of their
human rights on par with others 
, before we go further, let me outline the learning objectives
Music
This in brief we know is the
need for having a separate institutional framework 
And if you look at the 1995 persons with disabilities Act, it talked about
Music
employment, it talked about education, talked about Social Security,
talked about barrier free access,
research and development for persons with disabilities 
And it created a chief commissioner at the
national level, and the state commissioners in various states
for this module 
to monitor the implementation of the provisions of the
persons for disabilities Act, when this act was being
amended or replaced, in line with the
India's obligations under international law 
In fact, in the last module, we saw
the UN Convention on the Rights of persons
with disabilities that was adopted by the UN general
assembly in the year 2006, And India rectified it in 2007 
And there was a requirement to harmonize existing legislations,
existing legal provisions with the requirements of the UN
In particular, we will see
convention on the rights of disabilities 
And that's how
Music
the legislation was brought
in the parliament  And that legislation
initially talked about the National Commission for persons
with disabilities and also some codes eventually after
deliberation in the parliament 
Finally, the 2016 Act came out with
the office of the chief commissioner for
what is the need for establishment of an office of
persons with disabilities at the center and provided a range of
functions for this office under section 75 of that Act 
I now draw your attention to the graphic,
which talks about the functions to be performed by the
chief commissioner  Basically, the chief commissioner is
expected to monitor the implementation, monitor the
compliance of various authorities with the with the
protective provisions which are there in the rights of persons with
disabilities Act 
Section 75(a) requires the office of chief commissioner of
the chief commissioner for persons for disabilities 
persons with disabilities to identify suo motu or otherwise
the provisions of any law or policy program and procedures,
which are inconsistent with these Act and recommend necessary steps 
In addition the chief commissioner is
expected to inquire suo motu or otherwise deprivation of
rights of persons with disabilities
and safeguards available to them in respect of matters for which
the central government is the appropriate government 
This is an extremely important provision
in the sense that

And it also drew public attention to the fact that
there are people who are been engaged as manual scavengers
to clean these insanitary latrines 
And to the wake of this damning revelations
in the 2011 housing census,
the parliament came out in the year 2013 
A new legislation on the prohibition of employment of manual scavengers
and their rehabilitation Act 
Here the emphasis is both

prohibition of the employment of manual scavenging, as well as
the rehabilitation of the those involved in the manual scavenging 
here for the first time the terms manual scavenging
has been widely defined in order to cover
severs and other forms of insanitary latrines
going beyond the traditionally understood dry latrines 
And there have been many new features which have been
brought in under this act
Music

structure, mandate of the
given a very clear mandate, the National Commission for safai karamchari
act was passed in the year 1993 
Under this Act, the commission was constituted in the
year 1994 
Initially for a period of three years,
the expectation was that the commission would achieve its objective
in a short span of three years 
But if you look at the current situation,
even after more than 25 years after the
adoption of this legislation,
National Commission for safai karamcharis and
the manual scavenging is still a reality 
that's how the commission was extended for a
period of three years each and in the year 2004
the National Commission for Safai Karamcharis Act,
lapsed as a result today, the National commission for Safai Karamcharis
is a non statutory body under the ministry of
Social Justice and Empowerment, and its mission is to
eliminate this dehumanising practice of manual scavenging,
and it has been given a number of functions 
In fact, I draw your attention to the following graphic 
also the critical a appraisal of this national commission

recommend to the central government a specific programme
of action towards elimination of inequalities in status,

Oversee the implementation of the national action plan
for total eradication of manual scavenging 
Make periodical reports to the central governments and state governments
on any matter concerning safai karamcharis 
The Commission has also been interested with the task of
monitoring the implementation of the prohibition of employment as
manual scavengers under Rehabilitation Act 2013
In fact,
as per section 31(1), of the said Act, the commission shall perform
the following functions namely, :-
To monitor the implementation of the Act,
To inquire into complaints regarding
contravention of the provisions of the Act,
and to convey its findings to the concerned authorities
with recommendations requiring further action 
And to advise the central and state governments for
effective implementation of the provisions of the Act 
And to take suo motu notice of matters relating to
Music
non-implementation of the Act 
In the discharge of its above mentioned functions,
the commission have the powers to call for
information with respect to any matter specified
above from any government or local or other authority 
let's come to the
assessment of the National Commission for safai karamcharis 
It faces a number of challenges relating to staffing,
staff shortages,funding for instance,
when you see that there are 26 lakh insanitary latrines identified in 2011
it relates to
Dear students,
housing census you can't eat the meager 4 crore amount
for the rehabilitation of people engaged in manual scavenging 
Third, the lapsing of the National safai karamchari commissions
Act to the year 2004 
And the lack of quasi judicial powers, and it being a
non statutory body is unable to enforce its decisions,
unable to get its action implemented by the
concerned state governments or the central departments 
There is yet another major problem
problem with the annual reports, which are often delayed 
Music
People say that there are just
achievements and activities of the Commission,
rather than recommendations for a framework action by
other actors  here are very, very profound issues
involving extreme form of untouchability, a dehumanising
a degrading practice, a hereditary occupation, and here is a
body which has been constituted to monitor
the implementation of the relevant legislation,
but without proper powers, without proper funding,
without proper manpower and other resources 
the absence of pour flush
There is a still a long way to go to secure the rights of people
who have been forced to persist in
this heinous occupation and there's a need for
all sections of the society to be vigilant and confront this

degrading, dehumanising practice 
And, in fact, no tangible efforts were made
to improve the sanitation to enable
people to come out of this effort for many centuries 
In this caste system itself if you see there is a reference to the
ritual purity, about the roles about the occupations performed

made by the Parliament of India  In fact, there was this
protection of Civil Rights Act of 1955 
Before we go further,
It was amended in the year 1976
under Section 7(a) was inserted in the protection of Civil Rights Act 
What does this amendment say ? It goes like this
whoever compels a person, who on account of untouchability
is forced to do scavenging is compelled to do scavenging is
will   this Act has been criminalized, this
amendment seeks to punish any person
who forces another on account of untouchability
to do scavenging with an imprisonment for a particular term

dehumanising practice and the need to eliminate and the need to punish
those who use manual scavengers
and also to have a uniform law across the country 
for preventing the construction of dry latrines and also for the
We will first learn what is meant by the term manual scavenging
rehabilitation of the manual scavengers 
The National Human Rights Commission,
recognizing this a very serious affront to human dignity,
took up this issue and in fact the
National Human Rights Commission, as you know,
was also constituted in the year 1993 
And it asked the Government of India
to issue a gadget notification to enable this
employment of manual scavengers and construction of
dry latrines Act to be notified and in fact, this notification is
and also see what are the human rights violations
important for several reasons it is for giving effect to the
or entry into the force of this act 
And also, the NHRC urged the central government to
frame rules under the Act  Many states
have denied the existence of manual scavenging 
They did not take necessary efforts to

Music

He need not give any reasons why he or she is
seeking a particular information and no personal details,
need be given by seeking information
excepting the contact details which are required
for supply of the information 
In other words, the RTI Act has not prescribed any specific performa
or a format for seeking information under section 6 of the Act 
Music
The only thing is that it should fall under the ambit of the Act 
And in where there is a dispute,
and what is the timeframe for giving this information,
whether certain thing falls under the ambit of the Act or not 
It is the courts which eventually decide
whether it does or in does'nt
Music
the person seeking information has to pay
a modest or a mild a very very small fee described under the Act
while seeking information 
In fact, we have seen already the definition of information
which covers a wide range of things,
including records, documents, orders, etc    A citizen has a
how does this right to information affect
right to seek information on orders etc  but he cannot ask
why such orders have been passed by authorities,
especially the judicial authorities 
, let us the turn our attention to as to who is a
public authority  in fact, the central government,
state governments or any body which has been established
under the Constitution of India, or any legislation passed
by the parliament or the legislature this is a public authority 
In fact, units which are owned bodies which are owned
controlled or substantially funded by central government
the enjoyment of human rights ?
or a state government are also regarded as public authorities 
non governmental organizations which are substantially funded
by the government are also regarded as public authorities 
In fact, one can seek information from them under the
Right to Information Act  In fact, every public authority is
required to designate Public Information Officers and also
other officers to receive appeals against the decisions of
the Public Information Officers 
This when a citizen files an application
or an RTI query, asking for information
These are some of the things we will look at, in this module 
there are only two courses of options which are open to the
public information officers  in case the information
exists and in case the information is held by
that particular public authority, the public information officer
is expected to accept the application and provide the information 
And the second option is that in case the information is not held
by the authority in case if the information is not
covered under the RTI Act 
The public information officer can reject such application 
, either of which should be done within a timespan of 30 days
Music
from the date of application 
There are several exemptions for furnishing of information,
which are provided under section 8,1 and 9 of the RTI Act 
They exempt public authorities from disclosure of certain information,
under certain reasons 
In fact, I draw your attention to the following graphic
and please pay close attention to the graphic to know the
exceptions to the disclosure of information 
For instance, the section 8 prescribes the following grounds for
rejecting a person's request for disclosure of information:
Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
If it pertains to national security,
or sovereignty and integrity of the nation 
National economic interests, relations with foreign states,
law enforcement under the judicial process,
information available to a person in one's fiduciary relationship,
cabinet papers and other decision making documents
trade secrets, intellectual property and commercial confidentiality,
individual safety, personnel privacy 
Infact, the following three grounds of rejection can be
cited by the public information officer under "public interest" 
that was adopted in the year 1948 
Trade secrets, intellectual property and commercial confidentiality 
Information available to a person in one's fiduciary relationship 
Personal privacy:
Section 9 allows the rejection of a request for
disclosure of information that would involve
the infringement of a copyright, subsisting in a person
other than the state 
Dear students we saw in the earlier graphic,
the items which were exempt from disclosure
under section 8(1) of the RTI Act 
And also article 19 of the
Infact the Act also provides that after a lapse of 20 years
after the incident to which the information relates
these items should be exempt from what you call
the operation of this non disclosure 
In fact, so, there is a 20 year time limit provided under the Act,
after which they cease to be exempt from disclosure 
Except in a few cases, what are those cases ? For instance,
if there is a information which relates to the sovereignty and
integrity of India or it relate to the strategic or
economic interests of the state or it relates to the maintenance
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966 
of friendly relationship with other countries
or secondly, if there is any information,
the disclosure of which constitutes a breach of privilege
of Parliament Or the state legislature
and information relating to Union Cabinet decisions
or state cabinet decisions or meeting of the committees of secretaries 
These will however, continue to be exempt from disclosure
even after the lapse of 20 years 
,
Music
Both assert the right of every citizen to seek,
Dear students,
if you look at section 24 of the RTI Act,
information relating to the intelligence wing of the state
or some security organizations have been exempted from the
purview of this RTI Act 
And these list of such organizations are specified in the
second scheduled to the RTI Act 
And the Union Government and the state governments are empowered to
amend this list from time to time 
I draw your attention to the following graphic,
which talks about various authorities under the Act
receive and impart information and ideas 
and the timeframe for entertaining or disposing of
the first query under the RTI Act or details for entertaining the
first appeal and the second appeal 
In addition, we look at RTI Act 
Music
There are detailed provisions relating to the Constitution,
functions and powers of the central information commission,
state information commissions which are mentioned 
And in fact, in the coming module, we will look at the operation of the
this central information commission in greater detail

article 19 (1) (a) upholds asserts are guarantees
freedom of speech and expression
and to give effect to this right to freedom of speech and expression,

And it replaced the Freedom of Information Act of 2002 
and how does it affect human rights ?
Music
welcome to MOOC on human rights in India  over the course of this
For instance, you know corruption, impedes,
the enjoyment of civil, political
as well as economic, social, cultural rights 
The right to information is a powerful tool in the hands of
the general public in order to have a corruption free
administration in order to have access to critical information
for the enjoyment of their rights including right to food,
education, health, social security and many other rights in these manner,
right to information acts as a enabler to realize other human rights 
RTI Act basically empowers citizen to seek information from a
module and the next module, we will look at the Right to
public authority and the information can be of diverse kinds 
And the RTI Act itself defines information in a very expansive manner
and through this, person can hold the government
accountable can hold the administration accountable 
In fact, there was a civil society movement in Rajasthan
which was started by kisan mazdoor shakti sangathan
and which really ask for master roles for Rural Employment programmes,
poverty alleviation programmes and unearth corruption
and they held the jansunwais and it was this movement
which really resulted in the enactment of the Right to Information Act
Information Act as also the central information commission
and under which there is a central commission
and there are state information Commissions
and if you look at the section 22 of the right information Act
the RTI acts as a over-riding provisions,
wherever there is a conflict between RTI Act on the one hand
and other laws say like Official Secrets Act 
In fact, the adoption of the RTI Act represents
a paradigm shift from an era or a regime
governed by under the Official Secrets Act to a transition to a
era or a regime governed by transparency and accountability 
and state information commissions 
Sections two of the RTI Act contains definitions and
the word information has been defined 
This information means material of any kind
may include documents, records, file notings, logbooks,
contracts or material held in any electronic form
and many other things like maps, photographs, and
so on and so forth 
And here is the definition of what constitutes information
and Supreme Court of India in a particular case involving
Central Board of Secondary Education on the one hand
In this module, we will first take up the right to information Act 
and Aditya Bandopadhyay and the other,

citizen and non disclosure of which may affect
the transparency or it may affect corruption 
On the other hand, there is a Category B, which talks about information
held by a public authority which is not covered by category A 
And then the third category contains information which is

not held by a public authority,
or which is not collected by a public authority 
The Supreme Court said both in terms of first and second categories 
The information should be supplied to the citizen
when asked for  in particular, as regards the first category,
information, disclosure of which can fight against corruption
fight against non transparency 
The court said the public authorities have a
duty suo moto to disclose that information 
They have a duty to under section 4 of the RTI Act
What is information? Who can seek
proactive disclosure all through their websites and other modes 
As regards second category, person can
file an RTI query and seek that information
as regards the third category,
that is namely the information that is not held
or collected by a public authority 
The court said this is not covered under the
ambit of the Right to Information Act 
The section 6 of the RTI Act any person can seek to information
from a public authority 
it and from whom it can be sought?

are not accessible to persons with disabilities,
and how those who are using wheelchairs
are unable to get into the aircraft in a dignified manner 
Quite often their wheelchairs are physically lifted, and they are placed in the
flight and in a which is a manner
violation of their human dignity 
In response, the Supreme Court directed the government
to provide ambu lifts, which can take a person
from the ground to the aircraft, and also
provide them IL chairs and other directions 
only on a single issue, like children's rights,
In another case, the disability rights group
complaint against the Election Commission before the courts of law 
Stating that while on the one hand the Constitution of India provides 
A right to vote, universal adult suffrage,
but there are practical difficulties in accessing the polling booths 
And this action by a non governmental organization has infact,
led to an important order by the Supreme Court of India 
Directing the state to make these polling booths
accessible by creating grams, and by providing
other facilities to various categories of persons with disabilities,
women's rights, bonded labour, child labour,
So that they could realize their right to vote 
Common Cause, which is another
registered non governmental organization filed a
petition before the Supreme Court of India on the right to speedy trial 
And the supreme court also gave a direction that
a right to speedy trial is an important facet or a dimension of the
article 21 dealing with right to life and Personal Liberty 
You take for instance, people's Union for civil liberties,
which is a national wide non governmental organization 
Deeply concerned about starvation deaths in Rajasthan 
and there are some who work on a range of human rights issues 
It moved a petition before that Supreme Court of India,
and it's a matter concerning a right to food
and very important right in itself and the Supreme Court 
Issued notices to all the states in addition to state of Rajasthan
and passed a series of interim directions
over a course of decade or , on the realization of right to food 
Which is a very landmark case in the history of Supreme Court of India,
and it is also widely regarded in many other countries of the world 
, the NGOs use the strategy of
filing repetition or complaints to the national or state human rights institutions 
And there are some which are confined to a particular district
in addition, they also seeknon judicial
administrative measures or remedies from the
central or state or local authorities 
,they also use the research and documentation
as an important strategy  For instance, they work at the grassroot level,
they work at the local level, they work at the state and other levels
and they bring out comprehensiveevidence based
high quality reports on burning human rights issues 
Let me give you a few examples 
The Center for Science and the environment
Or state and there are some which work across the country
as brought out a number of studies onclean air
pollution,drawing public attention
to the hazards are also seeking
appropriatesteps from the governmentPratham 
A non governmental organization brings out on an annual basis 
A comprehensive report on right to education of children
and the state of its implementation and which is again,
used by many scholars, government agencies, and others for taking remedial action 
Oxfam brings out a report on poverty
and these are only just a few examples  There are many otheragencies,
or in a particular region of the country 
non governmental organizations, which bring out
comprehensive reports on serious human rights matters 
And these are used to by the National Human Rights institutions,
used by courts of law ,used by our governmental agencies 
In addition to these few strategies,
in G was alsoraise funds for their activities 
For instance, as I said, they are outside this pay law of government
and depend on international development agencies, charities,
foundations, etc for their funding 
The NGOs also build up alliances 
And there are some inter governmental
In fact, when they build alliances with the like minded organizations 
They can draw attention to a cost quickly
and they can also collective energies and collective efforts
to advocate for human rights costs 
But it's just there is a Jan swasthya Abhiyan
which is a conglomeration of 20 networks
and thousand odd, NGOs and individuals working across the country
on the realization of right to health 
There is a National Alliance of grassroot NGOs NAGN 
which works on child rights  So the NGOs often build alliances
or international non governmental organizations
and use these alliances as a strategy to secure their goals 
NGOs also use legislative advocacy for securing
changes in the law reform or policy reform 
And they also use media advocacy,
and use the internet, the digital media
and online petitions and other a internet based strategies
for drawing attention to the serious human race issues
and also for awareness generation 
In fact, naming and shaming
has a critical role in the task of protection and promotion of human rights 
like, the Amnesty International or the Human Rights Watch
Nobody would like to be known as a human rights violator
and would like to avoid public ridicule,
avoid criticism at any cost 
, NGOs through a clever strategy of media advocacy
can name and shame, human rights violators
and thereby secure better protection of human rights 
Thank you 
and many other examples are there  ,there are different
Dear Students, Welcome to UGC MOOC on Human Rights In India 
types of non governmental organizations that are around ,
what is their relationship with the other wings of the state?
As you know, the in the national human rights protection system 
The NHRI occupies a pivotal role and it complements the role of
the legislature, the executive and the judiciary,
the civil society of which the non governmental organizations
are an important constituent also complement the efforts of the
other three wings of the state as well as an NHRI's, in fact,
the non National Human Rights institutions
act as a bridge between the government on the one hand
In this module, we'll take up role of NGOs
and the non governmental organizations on the other 
, how do these NGOs advance the costs of human rights?
They employ a variety of strategies 
In this exercise, but it says let us take 3d monitoring process 
Today, there are over 70 legally binding international
or multilateral treaties that have been adopted
under the auspices of the United Nations General Assembly,
and they constitute international human rights law 
and of which there are nine core treaties 
, countries sign and ratify them and undertake
in the protection and promotion of human rights 
a variety of legal obligations  These include reporting from time to time 
And the NGOs feed into this treaty monitoring process in a number of ways 
For instance, a state, which is expected to submit
a state party report is supposed to conduct
a broad based in consultation with various stakeholders across the country 
Before it finalizes its report  The NGOs can feed into this process 
In addition, the non governmental organizations often
submit what are called parallel reports,
alternatives reports or shadow reports,
they depict the reality in a different manner 
What is an NGO? It's a as the name suggests,it is outside the government 
In fact, the government reports quite often might claim that
the picture is a rosy one as far as
the protection and promotion of human rights in the country is concerned
before an international audience ,before the UN treaty monitoring bodies,
while on the other hand, the actual reality
at the ground level could be far from satisfactory 
So the non governmental organizations through their shadow reports
bring to the attention of the treaty monitoring bodies,
the realities at the ground level 
In addition, when the 3d monitoring body
It is expected to be an independent from the government 
engages with the state in issue in question
the NGOs also Prepare a set of questions that could be put to the
state and also,eventually, at the end of the process 
When the treaty body use a set of concluding observations or recommendations 
NGOs also monitor the follow up action taken by the states 
They disseminate the recommendations of the treaty monitoring bodies
widely within the country and also monitor
the follow up action taken by the state
and where the follow up action is deficient 
They put pressure on the state to see that
It is a legal body legally registered of persons,who come together
proper follow up or implementation of these critical recommendations is carried out 
The NGOs here employ a variety of means,
for instance, they file Rit petitions before the
courts of law or before statutory bodies like
National Human Rights Commission,
National State Human Rights Commission's
National Commission for Minority, Children's Commission
or SC or STcommission, or the central information commission
or state information Commission's and seek remedy
for an individual victim or a group of victims of human rights violations 
for carrying out certain activities 
Let me give you a few examples 
For there was a Legal Aid Services forum in West Bengal,
which was aided by a former judge justice D K  Basu 
When confronted with a series of custodial deaths,
custodial violence cases, which were reported in the media 
The chairman, executive chairman of this legal aid forum,
wrote to the Supreme Court of India through a letter
drawing its attention to these terrible atrocities
to this terrible human rights violation and requested the
Supreme Court to pass a series of directions 
There are different types of NGOs 
As the result, the Supreme Court issued
a number of important directions, which are displayed
in all the police stations of the country 
And these are monitored and the court also made it clear
that if these are violated 
It would treat them as a content of the code itself 
, let me give you a few more examples 
Javed Abidi, was leading a disability rights organization 
In fact, he was deeply concerned about
how our transportation systems are not
For instance, there are some which work
Music
They do put pressure on governments
to stop in their tracks to stop further torture 
In fact, there was a prisoner
in the Dominican Republic, who was a labor leader, and his name was
Julio De Pena Valdez  He acknowledged that
with every batch of letters  His treatment got better and better
and eventually, he was released  So today, Amnesty International
is an important international non governmental organization,
which works at the international level, which intervenes in the
Human Rights Council, which intervenes in many other un fora
a very important role putting pressure on the
and advocates for the production and promotion of human rights 
Let me now turn my attention to another important
international non governmental organization called Human Rights Watch 
It consists of 400 staff members, worker working across
many countries of the world  It was established in 1978
Every year it brings out more than one Hundred reports
focusing again on more than 100 countries of the world 
And these reports are solid reports
based on in depth research at the ground level
after collecting facts after painstaking documentation,
United Nations, putting pressure on the
and these reports contain recommendations to national authorities,
intergovernmental organizations, United Nations
and other stakeholders, and these reports
have in fact led to the protection and promotion of human rights 
In many countries across the world 
In fact, Human Rights Watch works on a range of issues,
including business and human rights,
counterterrorism, refugee rights, civil and political rights,
and the entire gamut of economic social cultural rights,
and it has been able to make a significant difference
international non governmental and putting pressure
at the world level for promoting human rights 
Now, let me give you one more example
called International Federation for human rights, or its abbreviation is
FIDH, in it's a federation of
organizations that are about 184 organizations working across 112 countries,
out of all of them employ a range of means or tools
for,protecting human rights defenders, and in particular,
woman human rights defenders, and they send urgent action responses
and they also employ a tool called strategic litigation 
and , in this tool
on the intergovernmental organizations, putting pressure on the other
intervene in the International Criminal Court 
Whenever there are serious cases of concerning war crimes,
crimes against humanity, genocide, or they also intervene in
internationalized tribunals or hybrid tribunals like the Cambodian one 
They also intervene in the European Court of Human Rights 
And fid hatch brings out a report
on the status of human rights defenders across the world,
highlighting flagging serious challenges faced by the
human rights defenders as a result of their work 
And these tools which fidh have employed have led to
important stakeholders to advance the costs of production
lot of positive outcomes for the human rights organizations across the world 
Forum Asia is an Asian organization,
again, an inter governmental organization 
It was founded in 1981  in Manila,
like other NGOs, Forum Asia also
uses tools such as research, documentation,
publication of reports, capacity building,
at the international level, or at the regional level 
And they have a unique program called National Human Rights institution program,
which looks at the National Human Rights institutions
and promotion of human rights  Before we go further,
in the Asia Pacific region, whether they are performing well
or not, and if not, they do send
observer missions  They do send teams for on spot
investigation to ascertain facts  And based on these,
they publish or they issue press releases,
they get into media advocacy, they get into legislative advocacy,
and using all these using high quality reports,
they have been able to effectively
influence the production and promotion of human rights
in the regional bodies, either at the ASEAN or Sark
these international non governmental organizations have been having
or other countries in Asia and also at the United Nations,
in conclusion,NGOs employ a variety of means
to advance the production promotion of human rights 
And there are some international NGOs
which reached a very high level of organization
and they operate in more than hundred countries of the world,
on topics or themes selected by them, and they are making
an important difference and they are able to change outcomes,change law,
change policy, change state action, put pressure on state 
Whenever it violates human rights and we have seen
a great impact at the world stage 
The Amnesty International, The Human Rights Watch,
The International Federation of human rights FID hedge and Forum Asia,
There are many others who are also doing similar work 
For example, there is an international rehabilitation Council of torture 
And there are many, many organizations which are working
and all of them using a range of tools
to protect and promote human rights 
Thank you 
For instance, there was an international campaign on land mines 
For long, it was known that the landmines were maiming,
Dear students, welcome to the MOOC on Human Rights In India 
injuring people and were leading to a lot of human rights violations
and the efforts of non governmental organizations we're not
leading anywhere and In this context,
a range of international NGOs came together
and advocated for adopting a binding multilateral treaty 
Which eventually ended up with the adoption of
water war treaty banning the production, deployment of
anti personnel landmines  And it is a successful story 
A half how NGOs can build alliances across the world,
and how NGOs can advocate and bring about
In this module, we will take up the role of international
an important changes in the multilateral rules 
Take for instance, Rome Statute for International Criminal Court
way back in 1948, the Genocide Convention provided
for international tribunal to try the crime of genocide
as and when it was established between 48 to 98 
For five decades, there was no prospect of a
permanent standing international criminal code
to try such serious offenses as genocide 
Maybe because of Cold War rivalries,
maybe because of many other strategic and other reasons,
non governmental organization with the help of a few case studies 
it did not come through  In fact, it was a
coalition of non governmental organization,
which came together in the form of CICCA,
Coalition for International Criminal Court,
whichin conjunction with a group of small and medium countries,
were able to pursue it  The powerful countries
and which eventually led to the successful conclusion of the
Rome Statute for International Criminal Court in the year 1998 
And today, the court came into is there
and it is permanent add in from since 2002 
Today,as a result of the globalization,as a result of the
It has been functioning effectively 
And so, this again is an important example of
how international NGOs can come together
and in conjunction with small and medium countries could
bring out our make others adopt
important multilateral human rights treaties 
Let us take a few case studies 
You've all heard of Amnesty International
or how did this Amnesty International
which act walks across the world come into being 
free movement of people, the global transportation links,
In fact, in 1961, there was a British lawyer Peter Benenson
He was deeply moved  when he came across a case of
two Portuguese,students who were present 
Their only fault was that they raised a toast for freedom 
In fact, he sent out he published a article
in their observer appeal for Amnesty 
In fact, this appeal was printed by media organizations across the world 
And there was a momentum that was generated,
which eventually led to some successful outcome for those prisoners 
In the years that followed, Amnesty International
the globalized communications, the interpenetrating world economies
has grown in strength and it
There is an international Secretariat
in the London and there are national sections in many countries 
And there are volunteers acrossing, walking across the world 
And it doesn't accept money from governments 
It works on purely donations from members and private individuals 
It works on issues such as abolishing of capital punishment 
It works on torture  It works on prisoners of conscience,
human rights, education, and many other
such important human rights issues  And it employs a range of tools,
through trade the world in a way has become
including in depth research, publication of reports 
For instance, every year it brings out an answer
and annual report on the state of human rights in the world,
which gives the trends, which are mentioned about the serious challenges
faced in individual countries or in different regions of the world 
And in addition to these report on a
the state of human rights or reports on particular teams,
Amnesty International also issues, press releases from time to time,
putting pressure on the government's putting pressure on
other agencies for promotion of human rights 
global village and in this context,
Let's say aprisoner of conscience is being tortured 
Amnesty International has an urgent action network
and there are a group of individuals
who put out an appeal
and this appeal is addressed to the Prime Minister,President
and all other major authorities in the country 
And it's also there are expressions of support
to the prisoner concerned and his family members 
When one gets hundreds of letters,
telegrams, faxes, emails from across the world, from different corners of the world 
the International non governmental o rganizations have been playing
Music
they're supposed to be established
in full conformity with the what are called Paris principles 
That were adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in the year 1993 
These Paris principles require that a National Human Rights Commission
should have a wide mandate, not necessarily
civil and political rights, but also economic, social cultural rights 
And it should also have functional autonomy and independence
and it should have diversity and pluralism in its composition 
And these Paris principles are so important 
And in fact, world over there are more than 120
When you look at India, the people's Union for
National Human Rights Commission's and there is a body called
Global Alliance of NHRI or GANHRI,
which accredits the NHRI depending on the
extent of their compliance with the Paris principles 
Those NHRI's which are fully compliant with the Paris principles,
get 'A' grade accreditation and they have full rights of participation
in the Proceedings of the Human Rights Council 
On the other hand, there are institutions which are partly compliant
and which are not compliant  They get B grade With an observer status,
or C grade, and so with each grade having its own privileges 
civil liberties comes out as a very important actor or player
,it's very important to interragate,
the way NHRI's are constituted in different countries 
In fact, how are their members and chairperson appointed?
How are they selected? What is the level of transparency that is followed?
Do they represent the various sections of the
or a cross section of the society in that country?
Is there pluralism in its composition? Do they inspire confidence 
These are matters  Which are taken up by the AINNI
and it looks at today if you see our Indian situation,
you have National Human Rights Commission
in the wake of emergency that was imposed in the year 1975 
and state Human Rights Commission in states 
And you also have national commissions for women,
minorities, scheduled caste, Scheduled Tribes
with their counterparts in various states 
And we also have an Office of the Chief Commissioner
for persons with disabilities, and also a state Commissioner
for persons with disabilities  And you all have central information commission
and then state information Commission's 
Altogether there are over 170
NHRI is our state human rights institutions,which are under operation,
Lok Nayak Jaya prakash Narayan
it's very important to critically look at them
and evaluate them appraise them
to see whether they are conforming to the
internationally recognized paris principles are not and if not catalyze them 
It's not seek policy reform is not seek legislative reform 
, that they are in full conformity
with the universally recognized standards 
It's very important for the effectiveness 
It's very important for the independence of a body 
The moment you recognize human rights are seniors, bonding matters 
founded the people's Union for civil liberties
These are rights of an individual and they need to be
protected and promoted, and they are constitutionally guaranteed 
And dignity is an important value in the preamble of the Constitution 
At the same time, you the institutional machinery
that is created to realize these constitutional ideals goals 
The legislatory mandate that is a adopted or enacted
by the framers or by the lawmakers need to be realized 
In fact, AINNI came out with a first civil society report
on NHRC when it went before the accreditation, before the
United Nations constituted body in the year 2011 
and democratic freedoms or democratic rights in 1976 
And five years later, AINNI again came out with a
far reaching report on the extent of NHRC India's
compliance with the Paris principles, thereby
putting pressure on the Indian government, putting pressure on the
other authorities to take a critical look at the existing legislation,
take a critical look at the protection of human rights act
with a view to amandate, with a view to make 
The Human Rights missionary more effective 
We also have a People's Watch Tamilnadu, which was established in Madurai 
It works on a number of issues, including woman's rise,
And after his death, this organization has undergone
serious civil and political issues  It works on legal aid to the victims 
It works on filing complaints, securing,compensation,
restitution for victims of serious human rights violations,
particularly woman, persons belonging to scheduled caste,
Scheduled Tribes and other marginalized sections 
The People's Watch has also took up a novel initiative for spreading
Human Rights Education across the country, particularly
training school level teachers and for developing
a human rights consciousness among school children and among school teachers 
Thank you
some further changes  Initially, it was supposed to be beyond
political leanings so that people from all
political parties could come together and work
Dear students, welcome to the MOOC on Human Rights In India 
for the protection and promotion of human rights in 1980 
And revised, renewed people's Union for civil liberties came into being
which is a basically a membership driven organization
and it does not accept funding from any agency whether Indian
or international, and it is it runs through the voluntary
contributions of its members  And there are member lawyers
who, from their own funds, prepare cases, read petitions
and advocate for the victims of human rights violations 
The PUCL uses a variety of means
for the protection and promotion of human rights 
We have already seen how non governmental organizations
It has instituted in award called journalism for
human rights award, which is given out year after year 
As you know, media is an important ally
in the task of production and promotion of human rights 
And media often exposes serious human rights violations and thereby secures
better protection for the task and of human rights,
and the institution of an award to recognize
and imminent journalists for the work he or she has done 
He goes a long way in furthering the protection and promotion of human rights 
The PUCL also organizes an annual
employ a variety of strategies to advance the protection of
Jaya Prakash Narayan Memorial Lecture on 23rd March 
In fact, it was on this day that the emergency was lifted in India
and to commemorated celebrated academic celebrated activists 
Every year delivers an annual Jay Prakash Narayan Memorial Lecture
which goes a long way you spreading awareness about human rights 
The PUCL also brings out a monthly publication
called PUCL bulletin in English,
which reports the serious human rights issues,
which reports the challenges confronting India,
which also contains a number of critical pieces
and promotion of human rights and they are an important
about the current state of FIR's  And this publication
is well regarded across the world and is followed closely
by human rights activists and other non governmental organizations 
, let me give explain to you some of the important cases 
Which were taken up by people's Union for civil liberties 
In fact, in Rajasthan The PUCL notice that
on the one hand, there were granaries overflowing 
Food Corporation godowns overflowing and in the immediate vicinity,
and there was also the sorry spectacle of starvation deaths,
deeply moved by the Allied human rights considerations 
constituent of the National Human rights protection systems 
It filed a writ petition before the Supreme Court of India
on right to food and the considering the importance
and significance of this case  The Supreme Court also issued notices
to all the states of the country, and it passed a number of
important interim directions over a course of a decade on
anti poverty programs and other
social welfare schemes, pension schemes, and including
midday meal scheme, including Antyodaya annan Yojana
and many other schemes, directing the state to see that
right to food of everybody is protected in particular
And we have also seen certain case studies of
pregnant woman, elderly persons, persons with disabilities, etc 
And this case is a l andmark in the history
or annals of human rights jurisprudence in India 
There had been many other cases
which were taken up by the PUCL concerning payment dwellers
in Bombay their eviction rehabilitation,
fake encounters in Manipur, telephone, tapping
And communal riots, mental illness 
In fact, in Delhi, there used to be a shadra mental asylum,
and which has been renamed as Institute for Human Behavior and analysis 
international non governmental organizations 
The number of laws were also challenged
the number of laws which a transgress
the individual's human rights were challenged by PUCL
and in the Supreme Court of India 
, in other words, PUCL works across the country
has individual constituent units in various states
and it through its members through its member lawyers
using Research, documentation awareness generation
and other means, it furthers the costs of
protection and promotion of human rights and it has
In this module, we will examine some best practices evolved by
a number of important achievements to its credit in the last few decades 
, let us turn our attention
to another important organization called AINNI 
AINNI is an association of individuals and networks 
a watching or monitoring the National Human Rights institutions 
In fact, its birth was inspired by the similar organization,
which is working at the Asian level called anni 
ANNI,this is an association of NGOs monitoring
National Human Rights institutions at the Asian level  What does ANNI do in India 
In fact, if you look at the National Human Rights Institutions,
Indian non governmental organizations

very serious acts of violence against women in the Jessica lal murder case,
in the Priyadarshani matoo murder case or also Nirbhaya case
where these acts have really shaken the conscience of the country
and conscience of the humanity, particularly the Nirbhaya one
like which led to the public outcry and the kind of reporting
that was done by the media led to the Constitution of a high level
Task Force headed by Justice j  s  Varma and which in turn,
put together for reaching law reform proposal and it how
it ended up with the Parliament enacting criminal law Amendment Act
in the year 2013  And in this episode, some new offenses
But there has been a tremendous revolution in the field of communication 
have been added, including stalking, Voyeurism, sexual harassment,
and the rape itself has been expanded in a great deal
with a stringent punishment for various acts of rape 
And so on the one hand, you find that in priyadarshani matoo and Jessica lal
murder cases, the sustained campaign by media has led to
securing of justice for the families of the victims and in nirbhaya case 
It also led to the punishment of the
perpetrators and also ended up in a law reform 
You are aware of the campaign launched about by an NGO
called Bell bajao campaign  In fact, it is about domestic violence 
And it has been it's a mind boggling technological development 
It is a television, video short Television Video jingle,
who was a victim of domestic violence 
Go up and ring the bell and with a view to prevent the domestic violence 
And this was a very stunning campaign in the media,
which focus public attention on the need to address domestic violence
in a squarely important manner  You see the coverage in the past few years
about the equality movement, particularly how a woman
should have a right to enter all temples, including those temples,
which had either to be not open to the woman 
That have taken place about a few decades back 
And so, these campaigns have had a very important positive effect
and it they lead to the social changes, they lead to the
change of attitudes, they lead to the improved outcomes for women 
, there is yet another jouneral of rural reporting 
It was you know, it was a new ,it was a niche area, which was propounded by
nominant person called sainath who visited rural areas
and painstakingly documented the distress of farmers
and the corruption at the rural areas, the starvation deaths and his
in depth, his systematic reports in the rural areas
in the Hindu newspapers have led to a lot of changes
The what was the display held by the newspapers
have led to a lot of public attention to a often neglected area 
,this also led to the conferment of
important Awards on SaiNath on the media reporting
has also had many positive effects 
National Human Rights Commission can take action on a complaint
either by a victim or somebody on the victims behalf like an NGO
or it can also has a power to take so much cognizance based on the media reports 
And the NHRC indeed takes regular cognizance
of serious media reports, dealing with custodial violence,
starvation deaths, and other violations of economic,
or radio,television has given way to the digital revolution 
social cultural rights and civil and political rights 
And these cases, which have been, you know, initiated
as a result of media reports have also led to a positive outcome
and positive impact for the victim of such violations 
Parliamentarians often use such media reports
to draw attention of the government in the zero hour or in the question hour
and use these reports to hold the executive accountable 
In fact, media has a constructive role in becoming a bridge
between communities, but any insensitive any sensationalism,
any unfair reporting can also divide the communities
Today, we have Twitter, we have Facebook, we have Instagram,
can they can in fact, it can lead to the deepening of the fissures,
deepening of the divisions, caste, communal
and other divisions existing in a society 
, in conclusion, media has a very important role
in the task of protection and promotion of human rights 
It can be an ally, it can be watchdog,
it can expose violations, it can mold public opinion,
it can shape public attitudes, it can be an instrument of social change, but
in any improper portayral in the media, any unfair reporting,
any sensationally reporting can also lead to human rights violations 
we have mobile SMS, we have all these devices,
In other words, it has a role for positive as well as a negative one 
And it has it has a great power 
And that's why it's very important to recognize that power 
And it's very important to channelize that power through self regulation
and to ensure that the predominance of politics,
cricket, fashion news, and other such frivolous things,
some form of it which masquerades as a news
and it's basically infotainment and it the views and infotainment

Dear students, welcome to MOOC on Human Rights In India 
Beat politics, beat, security or other development, including
burning issues relating to human rise and
it's a On your handheld device,
and instantaneous transmission has
really led to a total change in the way media impacts us
and media  In fact, let us briefly dwell on the role of the media 
In fact, media is regarded as a fourth estate in a democracy,
complementing the efforts of the other three organs,
including the legislature, executive, and judiciary 
It is it can be a formidable ally, in the task of
In this module, we take up the role of media, in the protection of human rights 
protection and promotion of human rights 
It can be a fearless watchdog, holding others accountable 
It can be an instrument of social change,
and it can be a source of early warning 
For conflicts, genocide, orphamines or many other issues 
, in other words, it has a tremendous role  It has a
tremendous impact and it has a tremendous power
and in the Constitution of India, Article 19 talks about
freedom of speech and information whereby the freedom of press is
inferred or implied from the article one (a) of the Constitution 
We have already seen the role of legislative,
, let us see now, how media impacts both in a positive way
and in a negative way and what is his relationship between
human rights protection and promotion 
Let us see a few generous of
journalism or media reporting 
A few decades back, there was a journal
of investigative reporting came into being 
In fact, it was in bhagalpur of Bihar 
Some detainees were blinded by police personnel
by pouring acid into their eyes 
executive and judiciary, in the task of protection and promotion
It was a gruesome custodial violence 
and it was reported by the Indian Express,
which led to a filing of a public interest
litigation before the Supreme Court of India  It led to
a lot of action against the errant police personnel 
So in this case, you find that media has exposed a serious human rights violation 
And in fact, in the following years, there were many such
investigative stories about trafficking of
women and children are corruption or other such serious
human rights violations  So by exposing such violations,
of human rights that will let us media is an important part of civil society 
the media has a role to mount public opinions to shape
public opinions, a set agenda of the for before the country 
And let's look at corruption  In fact, corruption is a serious
human rights violation  And we have a right to be free from corruption,
which is also regarded as a human rights in itself 
The corruption impacts negatively on everyone,
and particularly the enjoyment of economic social cultural rights
by the poorest sections of the population
when that being so media
has in fact exposed several acts of corruption
In fact, it has a critical role 
in a very fearless manner, one has to only recall
how several years back the sustained reporting of an arms deal
and also recently about an arms deal have really focus public attention on
standards of transparency, standards of ethics required in governance 
Let me turn our attention to about a year back a major case
which came to be known as Panama Papers 
this Panama Papers is about the leak of
about 11 million files held by a law firm called mossack Fonseca,
It was operating in 42 countries  In fact,
it was the fourth biggest in the world and catering to over 300,000
Several centuries back before the invention of the printed word,
companies and many rich people, many influential people
exploited it to stash away  Illgotten wealth in several
offshore tax havens  And these data files were
through an investigative reporting secured world secured by a German newspaper 
And that German newspaper in turn handed it over
to a International Consortium of Investigative Journalists 
And the revelations were mind boggling 
There were senior political leaders from Iceland,Britain, Russia, Ukraine, Egypt,
Pakistan, India, and many other countries were reported upon 
And in fact, it led to the resignation of then Iceland
it was the oral tradition  It was the word of mouth communication folk tradition 
Prime Minister and the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
passed very important order, holding that the then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif,
whose name came out in the Panama Papers leak case
was unfit to hold the position of the prime minister 
And consequently, there was a follow up action that was taken against him 
And India has self has also launched a multi agency task
force to go deep into these allegations 
We have seen the investigative reporting, we have seen the corruption 
Let us turn our attention to media and women's rights 
In fact, there are a few instances of violence against woman
Which was regarded as a traditional media 
Music
represented by the Supreme Court on the high courts
are the custodian of fundamental rights are provided 
Or Guaranteed under the Constitution of India
and the public interest litigation
as it evolved over the years, and the Supreme Court
and the higher courts within India have advanced the cause of human rights 
which we will see in great detail in the coming modules 
, we will also see the work of civil society,
particularly, the role of media and role of NGOs,
role of trade unions and economics in the task of
these different elements in this module 
protection and promotion of human rights 
We have seen the , at the national level,
the role of executive legislature judiciary
and civil society and how does it connect with the universal system 
, let me read out to you What the United Nations has said 
In fact according to UN, "Important elements of a national protection system
include one laws consistent with
international human rights standards 
Number two, effective functioning of courts, judiciary and law enforcement,
as well as independent human rights institutions, or ombudsman 
First, let us take up the notion of human rights 
Number three, procedures for individuals to
effectively claim one's rights 
Number four, good governance and accountable
government institutions that promote and protect human rights 
Number five, democratic, open, transparent
and participatory
,decision making process  strong civil society
including a free and independent media 
in 1993 UN General Assembly adopted Paris principles 
In fact, the National Human Rights institutions
What are human rights?
areexpected to be comply with these Paris principles,
which basically say that NHRI should have a wide mandate 
And they must have a plural composition
in terms of its membership, and they are expected to have
both functional ,autonomy and independence 
, these Paris principles are very critical
for the effective functioning of a National Human Rights institution 
In fact, at the United Nations level
there is a global alliance of National Human Rights institutions 
Which accredits NHRIs, those which are fully compliant
Human rights are those rights which accrue to a Human Being
with the Paris principles and participate in the
Human Rights Council and its meetings and they have full speaking rights 
On the other hand, there are partly compliant
or non compliant human rights institutions,
which do not have such full participation rights 
, in a way, NHRIs play an important role
in the protection and promotion of human rights
and they complement the work of legislature ,executive ,judiciary
and civil society  just as all human rights belong to
all Human Being, the task of protection and promotion of human rights
merely by virtue of being born into the human family
is the responsibility of everyone and different wings
Which we examine in this module  And in the coming modules,
We will take up for more in depth examination,
the Paris principles and the work of National Human Rights Commission of India
and a critical appraisal of the commission and also
the work of the legislature executive, judiciary ,civil society
for intensive examination,
the National Human Rights Commission and also the Paris principles
will be subject matter of number of modules in this coming weeks 
And so in conclusion, we have this national human rights protection system 
and they belong to everyone, regardless of any distinctions based on gender,
At the core of it is the NHRI'S,
which complement the efforts of the
other wings of the state, namely legislature,
executive, judiciary, and the civil society also
is an important actor in the National Human rights protection system

or otherwise, every Human Being is expected to enjoy
the full range of human rights 
In fact, the World Conference on human rights 
which was held at Vienna, in the year 1993, came out with a
declaration and a platform for action 
In the Vienna declaration 1993 It was asserted that all human rights are
Universal, indivisible interrelated and inter dependent 
, today, these human rights have
become so significant are so important  They In fact,
set limits on the state's actions 
Dear students, welcome to week one module one
Let us now see the international system 
Under the United Nations under the UN General Assembly 
A range of binding conventions or non binding standards
on human rights have been adopted  There are what are called
charter based bodies and treaty based bodies and they constitute
what is called an international system
and it is complemented by
regional systems for the protection and promotion of
Human Rights in Europe, the Americas, Africa and other regions of the world 
, We have international system
onz the National Human rights protection system 
represented by UN and then you have a regional systems
and both of them are complemented by
what are called National Human Rights protection system 
In fact, these national systems
act as a let me first give you an overview of this system 
You have this diagram, which captures the
in a graphical manner, the National Human rights protection system 
At the core of the system is a National Human Rights institution 
In fact,if you see in some countries 
the source of the NHRI is provided in a in their constitution
We will take up this notion of human rights
or in a specific statute  And they are supposed to be independent,
not just a government department,and they are supposed to be autonomous
and with their funds being voted or approved by the parliament 
And these are unique entities,
and they're neither part of government, they are nor civil society 
And but they are autonomous, and they are pivotal
or at the core of the National Human rights protection system 
On the other hand, you also have legislatureexecutive 
Judiciary, which are three wings of the state 
Each of these wings of the state  Their powers and functions have been
and also its significance  Thereafter,
explained or given in detail in the Constitution of India 
,each of these three wings have a specific role
a specific responsibility for the protection
and promotion of human rights  These three wings of the state
are complemented by the work of the civil society 
, what is this civil society it is a,
this term is used to connote the non governmental organizations,
the trade unions, the academics, the media, and other
who are not part of the government 
And , in fact, the National Human Rights institution
try and have an understanding of the production system
is expected to be a bridge between
the government on the one hand and the civil society on the other 
Let us briefly look at each of these institutions 
Let's say legislature: it's main task is expected to
pass legislations and the members of the legislature's
have adopted a number of legislations,
Guaranteeing the rights of specific groups of people like woman,
children, persons belonging to scheduled caste, Scheduled Tribes,
minorities, persons with disability, etc 
In addition, the members of parliament
available in the world at large and then come to the
can used a range of means for protection of promotion of human rights 
They have a question hour, they have a zero hour 
They have a call attention motion,
and they have many other legislative means to advance
the protection and promotion of human rights 
In addition, there are parliamentary standing
committees on many specific subjects,
including woman the welfare of scheduled caste social justice etc 
They also advance the task of human rights 
,the executive is tasked with the
National Human Rights production system
enforcement of laws and also evolve
policies, programs and schemes and if you look at the Government of India 
There are ministries, which like focus on
a woman and children's development, labor,
social justice, disability or Minority Affairs,
Health and Family Welfare, Human Resource Development 
, the work of each of these ministries
is critical for the protection and promotion of human rights 
, let us look at the role of judiciary 
Judiciary, particularly the higher judiciary,
and its various elements  We will also see the relationship between

The court read principles of reasonableness in Article 14 
The Supreme Court said article 14 strikes
at arbitrariness in state action and ensures
fairness and equality of treatment 
The principles of reasonableness,
which legally as well as philosophically is an essential element of equality,
or non-arbitrariness pervades article 14 like a
brooding omnipresence and it goes on 
The approach of reading reasonableness has made new developments in the law 
arbitrary or unreasonable actions
Ashoka Rock edicts, also resonate a few human rights,
according to the court are per se, discriminatory 
Article 15 to 18  expand the scope of
equality mentioned in Article 14  In particular,
  article 15 prohibits
discrimination based on caste
religion,race etc  In the same article, in the same article
there is a provision for,
for making special arrangements
for socially and educationally
backward Classes of citizens or for
Including the right to food 
persons blonging to scheduled caste and schduled tribes 
Article 16 prohibits discrimination in matters of public employment 
In particular, this article keeping in view,
the principle of treating equally,
it says that state can make special provision for
persons belonging to scheduled caste,scheduled tribe
or rather backward classes in matters of public employment
with a view for their adequate representation 
Article 17 abolishes the practice of
untouchability in all forms while article 18 does not removes
In fact, if the ancient Indian notion of Dharma 
the conferment of titles by the state  Article 19 deals with
six essential freedoms which include among others, freedom of speech
and expression, freedom of association,freedom of assembly
and freedom to practice, occupation,trade,business,etc 
This is weapon to citizens and can be exercised throughout
the territory of India But this is not an absolute right,
but is subject to a number of reasonable restrictions which are mentioned in the
chapter three of the Indian Constitution 
For instance, take right to freedom of speech and expression 
It's very important, right, in a democratic setup 
It does not mean a set of religious laws,
Andthis has been expanded by the
courts in a number of cases  And the Supreme Court has also read
freedom of press as a part of the
freedom of speech and expression,And this is subject to
a number of reasonable restrictions based on
security of the state based on
public decency, or morality, friendly relations with neighbors,
and a number of other let's turn to
our attention to Article 20  It gives certain guarantees
to those who are accused of certain crimes 
but it is similar to the concept of rule of law 
There are three classes under Article 20,
they deal withex post facto or retrospective application of laws 
And there's another class which talks about protection from double jeopardy
and the third clause, deals with right to be free from self incrimination 
They guaranteea range of rights, including right to equality,
Abolition of untouchability and also six essential freedoms 
In fact, in the next class, or next module, we will take up
the remaining articles of chapter three
starting from article 21 to Article 32
The Dharma bound, even the king 
Thank you 
if you see the Dharamashashtras 
It did speak about independence of judiciary,
and these decisions of the judiciary were supposed to bind even the king 
, these were the ancient Indian ethos and traditions 
Students Welcome to week one, module two 
which upheld a number of rights 
But during the British period, if you see the Indian citizens did not
enjoy equal rights and they were discriminated
According to the celebrated historian Ramachandra Guha 
There were four conditions, which really
influenced the chapter on fundamental rights in the Indian Constitution 
One was that during the British rule,
there was a denial of civil liberty to all Indians 
Secondly, there were deplorable social conditions,
We take up human rights provisions in the Indian Constitution 
particularly the treatment of so called untouchables and women,
which is needed to be remedied through the Constitution 
religious, linguistic ethnic minorities,
which were divided and exploited by the British
during their over 200 years rule 
And, lastly, there were exploitation of
tenants by the landlords  All of these had influenced or shaped
the minds of our constitution framers 
The part three of the Constitution,
In fact, in this module we will cover article 14
which deals with fundamental rights, is in a way
enshrines a number of important rights 
The deal with right to equality,certain freedoms,
Right to life and personal liberty and so on and so forth 
In fact, the legislature and the executive
cannot modify these fundamental rights guarantees in a big way 
In fact, they have only a limited role there 
After thepronunciation of basic structure doctrine,
by the Supreme Court of India, according to which a number of
rights under Chapter three have been held,
dealing with right to equality and
to be a part of the basic structure and therefore cannot be
interfered with by the executive or the legislature 
these In fact, find the pride of place in the constitutional scheme
and they are in a way different from the other legal rights under on a higher pedestal 
let's come to the article 14 dealing with right to equality 
Article 14 is about every person within the territory of India
shall have right to equality before law, an equal protection of laws 
in this sense it is also applicable to the non citizens as well 
And It reflects it's a cause, The similar provision
in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provided under Article seven of UDHR 
till article 20 and article 21 to 32 will be covered in the next module 
Does Right to equality mentioned in Article 14
mean equal treatment uniform treatment to everyone?
No, it is not so  In fact, if you know, we have had
Centuries of caste discrimination in India,
and so two people who are at different stages of economic,
social and political development ,
it's not possible to regard everyone as equal 
, therefore, the state could make
a reasonable classification of people
on certain grounds, and these have been upheld by the court 
Before we go further, let us understand that
And if you see the constitution scheme, there is a affirmative action
provided for women and persons belonging to scheduled caste and
Scheduled tribes and also for persons who are socially
and economically backward sections of society 
In fact, the courts really propounded the principle that
the equality is for those within a particular group
who are on equal circumstances 
And in case people were in different circumstances,
they shall be treated with respect to the difference in their status 
And as we have discussed, a reasonable classification
human rights are not alien to the Indian culture, or ethos 
between different people was needed 
In fact, the Supreme Court has ruled that article 14
does not rule out classification for the purpose of legislation 
In Kedar Nath Bajoria vs the state of West Bengal,
The Supreme Court held, I quote, the equal protection of laws
guaranteed by Article 14 of the Constitution does not mean that
all laws must be general in character
and universal in application,
and that the state is no longer have the power of distinguishing
and classifying persons or things for the purpose of legislation Unquote 
If you see the Buddhist tradition 
In fact, the Supreme Court in their 1952 judgment,
state of West Bengal versus Anwar Ali Sarkar,
laid down the test for a valid classification 
The Supreme Court noted that, for a classification to be valid,
two conditions must be fulfilled, namely, one the classification must be
founded on an intelligible differentia,
which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together
from others left out of the group and two the differentia
must have rational relation to the objects sought to be achieved by the
stature in question , in Maneka Gandhi versus Union of India,
With exalted the non violence in thought, deed and action 
Music
is a part of right to life under article 21 
And the supreme court went on to say that
this right also includes protection of forests, lakes,
mountains, flora and fauna and protection from
air pollution, noise pollution, water pollution, and other
and also the maintenance of ecological balance
and sustainable development 
The Supreme Court of India also
recently in the last year in 2018, held that
right to privacy is also a part of article 21 dealing with
right to life and personal liberty, right against the exploitation
right to life for a long years, there was a dispute,
whether right to privacy was indeed
a fundamental right or not and that was laid to rest
in case Puttaswamy versus Union of India,
and Navtej singh case versus Union of India 
And in the case Puttaswamy's case, the supreme court held that
right to privacy is very much a part of article 21
dealing with right to life and personal liberty 
And in Navtej singh case the supreme court decriminalised consensual
same sex relations and holding that
and as well as right to religious freedom
right to privacy is a part of right to life and personal liberty 
And in last year, if you see, there was one more landmark judgement,
where supreme court recognize that right to life also
includes right to die with the dignity 
In other words it recognised passive euthanasia
or living will, by those who are terminally ill 
Now, let us turn our attention to rights against exploitation 
Article 23 of the Constitution deals with
right to be free from trafficking or beggar or forced labour
while article 24 prohibits employment of children
and few other rights 
under the age of 14 years in hazardous occupations, like
factories or mines  In M H  Hoskot v  State of Maharashtra,
the supreme court keeping in view the promise contained in
article 39 of the Directive Principles of state policy
held that right to free legal aid is a important facet of right to life
under article 21 of the constitution 
In the case of D K  Basu versus state of West Bengal
and Sheela Barse versus state of Maharashtra
the supreme court came down on custodial violence
and upheld the rights of detained person and accused persons
First, let us look at right to life and Personal Liberty 
and through an interpretation of Article 21 dealing with right to life 
And in fact, in the case of D K  Basu
the supreme court gave detailed directions on medical treatment
and also other directives on the accused person
being informed of the charges or a relative be informed about the
where abouts of the accused person and also registered to be
maintained in the police station and these guidelines
of supposed to be displayed in all police stations across the country 
In the Bandhua Mukti Morcha case, the supreme court said that
the health of workers both men and women should be protected,
If you see the article 21 of the Indian constitution
and also mentioned that the maternity relief
to main conditions of work and children should be freed from
any exploitative conditions 
And there again, drawing on the guarantee of right to life
and personal liberty under the article 21 of the constitution 
If you look at article 25 to 28,
they deal with right to freedom of religion, in all its facets 
In particular, right article 21 deals with the right to profess
and practice a religion and it is of course, subject to certain
restrictions based on morality, health and a public order and other
it says, no person shall be deprived of his life or
rights contained under part three of the constitution 
Articles 29 and 30 deal with the rights of minority to conserve
their language, culture and also practice and in
particular it also <lp  upholds the rights of minority educational
institutions to establish and administer them and with a view
to protecting their culture  Article 32 mentions that in case
of infringement of any of the fundamental rights contained
under chapter three, a citizen can take recourse to
constitutional guarantee and for the enforcement of the rights and
this is article 32 is also a fundamental right so
personal liberty, except in accordance with the procedure
therefore there is a constitutionally provided
judicial guarantee for the enforcement of rights 
In conclusion, we have seen articles 21 to 32 
And, in particular, we have spent a lot of time on article 21 how that
has been creatively interpreted to read a number of non
enforceable provisions, like right to food, right to hell,
and right to education, and right to human conditions of work
right to livelihood and right to privacy 
And as a part of the article 21 dealing with right to life 
We have also seen rights against exploitation
established by law 
provided under article 23 and 24
and also right to freedom of religion provided under Article 25 to 28,
and also rights of minorities under article 29 and 30 
And we have also seen the article 32 dealing
with the when there is an infringement of constitutionally
guaranteed rights, how it provides a remedy to any person
for knocking on the doors of Supreme Court or High Courts  </lp 
Thank you
This is an extremely important article, and
which has produced many other rights, in fact that the higher
Dear students, welcome to MOOC on Human Rights In India 
judiciary, through judicial innovation, through judicial
creativity, have read many new rights under article 21 
In fact, in the early years of the
after the adoption of the Indian constitution this
article was construed in a narrow way 
For instance, in AK Gopalan vs  state of Madras 
It was held that if there is a law,
which is a valid law and which is passed by the parliament
and which is applicable to all the citizens
and that will be sufficient to
I thank you for your interest and
come under this article  ep>
In fact, there has been a long development over the years
and this earlier narrow construction of article 21
has given way to a more expansive interpretation
and due process was read into this article in Maneka Gandhi's case
and later on further cases and the procedure has to be
reasonable and not arbitrary  And for now, let us turn our
attention to a number of other rights
which have been read into article 21 
If you see Francis Coralie Mullin vs Union Territory of Delhi 
to learn about the human rights system in India 
Justice Bhagwati expounded that the right to life doesn't mean
routine life, but all that goes with the to enjoy
a life with the dignity that includes
adequate nutrition, it includes clothing, shelter,
like opportunity to express one self freely, move about freely
mingling with others 
This even in some other cases like Maneka Gandhi,
again, this was reiterated 
Let us see Kharak Singh's case, Kharak Singh case as well
the Supreme Court held that
Dear students,
right to life doesn't mean merely animal existence, it goes much
beyond that right 
Let us see how some of the rights which are
mentioned in the directive principles under chapter 4 of
the constitution have been read into the part 3
under Article 21 
Right to education, for instance,
in Unnikrishnan vs  State of Andhra Pradesh,
and later on Mohini Jain vs  State of Karnataka 
The Supreme Court held that right to education is an important facet of
welcome to week one, module 3 
right to life and in subsequent years in 2002
there was a constitutional amendment, which was brought about
incorporating article 21-A enshrining right to education
under the, as a fundamental right 
Let's look at for instance, right to food there was a case of people's
union for civil liberties versus Union of India 
And this case, which laster for more than a decade,
the supreme court passed a series of
interium ordres upholding the right to food
and giving detailed directions on let's say,
In the last module, we covered certain provisions
various anti poverty programs,
various schemes for instance integrated Child Welfare scheme
Antyodaya Anna Yojana and other schemes
and held that right to food is a part of right to life 
giving force to the or giving a legislative recognition to the
right to food 
Similarly, right to health has also been
recognized as a part of Article 21 
In a series of cases, including Permanand Katara,
dealing with fundamental rights
Pashchim Banga Khet Mazdoor Samity
which talked about access to emergency medical services,
the supreme court held that right to help is also an important
facet of right to life 
Now, let us see the how article 21
has interacted with the rights of arrested persons or accused persons
whose liberty has been detained 
In Hussainara Khatoon (I) or the a common cause
which is non-governmental organizations,
The supreme court held that the accused persons
on part 3 of the Indian Constitution 
have a right to speedy trial and which is also
a facet of right to life and
so there were the moment somebody is arrested
or deprived of his liberty,
he or she do not cease to be persons this to enjoy
the protection under the article 21  <ep 
If you see there was an unimminent environmental activists,
M C  Mehta who moved a number of petitions
before the Supreme Court of India and the Supreme court
held that right to clean environment
During this module, we will take up
There has been a certain evolutive take
off the Supreme Court on this point 
The first case in 1952, state of Madras versus CHAMPAKAM DORAIRAJAN 
Dealt with this issue, the government had reserved certain number of seats
in college on the basis of religion and caste 
, this was in conflict with article 29 (2) 
However, the government's argument was that
this was an effort to give effect to Article 46,
which provides the right to education for the weaker sections 
The Supreme Court held that wherever there is a conflict
which have set down aspirational goals for the government
between part three and Part Four, Part Three would prevail 
, that means that if there is a conflict between fundamental rights
and the Directive Principles, the fundamental rights would be given
more importance to and the fundamental rights
would proceed over the Directive Principles 
music
In INRay Kerala education bill case, in 1957,
the Supreme Court came up with
a concept of harmonious construction between the fundamental rights
and the Directive Principles 
within their own constitution 
music
In this case, the Supreme Court a ruled
that there is no inherent conflict between
the Directive Principles and the fundamental rights 
They are essentially complementary and supplementary to each other 
, they must be read in such a way
that there is no conflict that is created 
,even though the Directive Principles cannot override
the fundamental rights, the directive the fundamental rights,
must be read in the light of Directive Principles 
The concept of these DSPS was borrowed from the Irish constitution 
music
In 1967, in I C  GOLAKNATH versus state of Punjab 
The Supreme Court held that the fundamental rights
cannot be overrided to give effect to the Directive Principles 
Music
However, the parliament in 1971
came up with the 25th amendment to the Indian Constitution 
Music
Under the 25th amendment, Article 31 C was added to the Constitution 
There are two parts to Article 31(c),
Now the director principles of state policies
the first part is that if there is a law that is created,
which gives effect to the Directive Principles laid down in 39b, or 39c 
Such a law cannot be called into question or cannot be held void 
On the basis of violation of Article 14, Article 19 or article 31 
Music
The second part of Article 31c stated that if there is any law 
Which mentions in its objectives that it is being promulgated,
to bring into effect the Directive Principles laid down in 39B and 39C 
Such a law is going to be beyond judicial scrutiny 
Music
are actually guidelines which are given to the government,
This amendment was challenged in the landmark judgement
of KESAVANAND BHARI versus state of Kerala in 1973 
The Supreme Court held that even though the parliament had the power
to amend any part of the Indian Constitution,
They could not interfere with the basic structure of the Constitution 
Music
Kesavanand Bharti does not lay down completely 
What the basic structure of the Constitution is?
However, it stated that judicial review was
one of the important components of basic structure 
both legislature and executive, which must be kept in mind 
And since in the second part of Article 31c 
Judicial review, there was a complete ban on judicial review
for any law which is being brought in to give effect to the directive of principles 
That part of Article 31c was struck down 
The parliament struggle continued and in the 42nd amendment in 1976 
The purview of Article 31c was expanded 
Article 31c, now read that any law which is promulgated to bring into effect,
not just the Directive Principles of 39b and c,
but any directive principle cannot be called into
question for violation of Article 14,19 and 31
While formulating the laws and policies of the country 
Music
In the landmark judgment of Minerva Mills 
The Supreme Court finally settled the conflict between
the fundamental rights and Directive Principles 
Music
In this particular case, the court held 
That fundamental rights and Directive Principles are two
important components of the Constitution
and must be read harmoniously with each other 
Article 31C was also changed back to its pre 1976 position 
These principles lay down certain high ideas for justice,
, Article 31 C as it reads now,
is that if there is any law, which is created
to bring into effect article 39b, or 39c 
It cannot be held void, if it is in violation of Article 14,19 or 31 
So it cannot be held void for the reason of violating article 14,19 or 31 
Minerva Mills settle the conflict to a large extent between
fundamental rights and Directive Principles,
by holding that both need to be read together 
And there needs to be a harmonious outlook towards them 
Over the years the government has been able to
political, social and economic equality
bring to effect some of the Directive Principles 
For example, the government has promoted the creation of village panchayats 
And now there are over two lakh village panchayats in the country 
Also under Article 47, which provides for
an increase in the standard of living 
The government has rolled out several schemes
like the integrated Rural Development Program
and the integrated tribal development program
to provide nutritional value to the people living under the poverty line 
Also, an article 39a right to work has been
and fraternity amongst the community 
Hello students and welcome to the MOOC on Human Rights In India 
recognized as an important directive principle 
This has also been recognized as part of right to life
by the Supreme Court in the Olga Tellis case
in the 86th amendment in 2002 
Article 45, which deals with right to education has been recognized
as an as part of right to live under Article 21 A,
which now ensures elementary education to all children 
So to sum up the Directive Principles or guidelines,
which are provided to the government for the creation of a welfare state 
Even though they are non justiciable, they have been recognized
They range from principles like distribution of wealth,
by the Supreme Court as important tools
for interpreting not just statutes, but also the fundamental rights 
The relationship and the conflict between the fundamental rights
and the Directive Principles has been resolved
in a manner in which both will be seen and read harmoniously together,
and neither can be given precedence over the other 
Over the years the government has been able to fulfill 
Some of the provisions which have been laid down in the directive principles,
but we have a long way to go in front of us 
Thank you

right to work right to education, maternity benefits,
protection of environment and protection of the architectural heritage of India 
Now, even though there are these high
ideas prescribed in the Directive Principles,
they are none justiciable in a court of law 
What this means is, a person cannot approach a court of law
to enforce the principles which are laid down in Part Four
Music
Today, we are going to discuss the module on Directive
Also, if there is a law that is in violation of a directive principle 
Just because of the fact that is in violation of the directive principle 
It cannot be held to be void 
Music
So there is very little legal force behind these principles 
Music
At the time of framing of the Constitution 
The members of the Constituent Assembly were faced with a dilemma 
There were certain rights, both civil and political,
and economic and social, which were taken to be protected 
Principles of state policies 
There was a commitment to protect these rights 
However, given that India was going to be a newly independent country,
and would have to face poverty and lack of resources,
certain principles, which were aspirational in a sense of
building a welfare state  But which probably could not have been
provided at the very onset They were laid down in the Directive Principles 
There was a particular thought process
that went into the idea of making these guidelines,
though,giving them as a direction to the future governments
but not making them enforceable in a court of law 
music
Some critics believe that the director of principles
are merely pious expressions and don't have any force of law 
The eminent members of the Constituent Assembly, like SIR BENEGAL RAU
believed that they were in fact educated measures 
Which could provide a certain direction for the development of the country 
The objective was to develop India as a welfare state 
In a welfare state, it is the responsibility of the state
to ensure health and other certain benefits to the citizens 
Specially to those members who are financially
or have a socially weaker section of the society 
The Directive Principles of state policies,
Hence, the Directive Principles have been framed in such away
Dr  Ambedkar believe that even though there isn't a legal force behind them,
There is definitely a political sanction or a political justice ability 
That means that the director of principles can be seen as guidelines,
which the electorate could keep in mind,
while judging whether a certain government
or a certain political party should be voted in power again 
These are the guidelines through which the progress of a government can be checked 
Also, according to Dr Ambedkar,
the Directive Principles were very similar to the instrument of instructions,
or DPSP are enshrined in part four of the Constitution under Article 36 to 51 
which are given to the Governor General and to the various governors in India 
Under the Government of India act of 1935 
, even though they are non justiciable,
an important feature of the Directive Principles
as recognized by the courts is that
they are useful in the interpretation of various statutes 
So the any statute must be interpreted in such a way
that there is no conflict between the statute and the directive principles 
Over the years, the courts have also come to recognize
that the directive principles help in understanding
Music
the scope of fundamental rights as well 
,the relationship between fundamental rights and Directive Principles
is an important topic of discussion 
Fundamental rights are negative liabilities that are put on the state 
, for example, these are guidelines
or these are instructions to the state of things which should not be done 
For example, the state shall not discriminate between people 
The state shall not interfere with the life and liberty of a person 
On the other hand, the Directive Principles are positive obligations 
That have been put on the state 
The DPSP are truly novel feature of the Indian Constitution,
For example, these are the measures like
providing the right to work or providing maternity benefits 
Which have to be given by the government 
For a person to be able to enjoy the right
, of course, fundamental rights are enforceable in a court of law 
And as we just discussed, DPSP's are not enforceable in a court of law 
, Now the question arises,
what happens when the fundamental rights
come in conflict with the Directive Principles?
This issue has come before the Supreme Court as early as the 1950s 
as there are very few countries around the world,
Article 13 of the Constitution provides
that if there is any law that is formed,
which is in violation of a fundamental right, such a law would be void 
Hence, we see that the Indian Constitution has made
the fundamental rights, which give recognition to international human rights 
Justice civil enforceable through courts of law 
Music
Apart from the fundamental rights 
Some of the economic, social and cultural rights find recognition
within the Directive Principles of State Policy
different sovereign states, as well as certain customary laws 
enshrined in part four of the Constitution 
Even though Directive Principles of state policies
are not Justiceible through courts 
They are to act as guidelines for the state
at the time of exercising executive or legislative power 
The Indian judiciary has also recognized
that the Directive Principles are an important tool of
interpretation while interpreting various statutes,
including the scope of fundamental rights 
Hence, some of the Directorate principles have actually found
Which are essential universally recognized principles, which all states follow 
recognition under the wider ambit of Article 21,
Which is right to life  , let's discuss the relationship
between Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Indian Constitution 
At the time of drafting of the Indian Constitution in 1949 
The UDHR had just come into existence in 1948 
The framers of the Indian constitution were greatly influenced
by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and tried to incorporate,
the principles in the Indian constitution as well, some of the
principles of UDHR like equality before law 
Which is laid down in Article seven of UDHR finds recognition in Article 14
The history of EU international human rights
of the Indian constitution provision from discrimination 
Which is again Part of Article 7 of UDHR finds recognition
in Article 15 of the new constitution, right to freedom of speech and expression 
Which is in Article 19 of UDHR finds
recognition in Article 19 (1(A)) of the Indian constitution
and right protection of life and liberty 
Which is an article 9 of UDHR finds mentioned
in Article 21 of the Indian Constitution 
In keshavanand Bharti case, the Supreme Court held
that even though UDHR is not a binding principle,
can be traced back to the 13th century 
It is important to note that this was the nature of human rights
that was recognized and accepted at the time,
when the Indian constitution came into existence 
Hence, UDHR is an important rule of interpretation and cannot be ignored 
In another case, chairman of Railway board vs  Chandrima das 
It was held that the UDHR is the universally recognized moral code of conduct
and hence cannot be ignored by them  Hence even though UDHR does not
create any legally binding obligations on the state 
The Indian judiciary has used it as an important interpretation tool,
and hence cannot be ignored 
When Magna Carta was created to act as a limitation on the English royal government 
Music
Next, let's discuss the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights and the Indian Constitution 
Music
Similar to the UDHR, there are certain provisions of the ICCPR,
which are also found in the Indian Constitution 
For example, Article 8 of ICCPR talks about prohibition of forced labour 
Which can be found in Article 23 of the Indian Constitution 
Article 25 of ICCPR talks about equality of opportunity 
Which can be found in Article 16 of the Indian Constitution 
After this, in 1776, at the time of independence,
Article 21 of ICCPR talks about Freedom of peaceful assembly 
Which can be found in Article 19(1) B of the Indian Constitution,
Article 23 of ICCPR talks about freedom of association,
which can be found in 19(1(C)) of the Indian constitution 
Music
Apart from the rights which have been laid down
as part of fundamental rights  The fascinating part of this discussion
is that the Indian courts have used international covenants
to give effect to certain enumerated rights
in the Indian constitution and make them a part of Article 21
Declaration of Independence of America,
as a part of right to life  Although in 1978 in the controversial decision
of ADM Jabalpur VS  Shivkant Shukla, the Supreme Court
had held that the Indian Constitution does not recognize
any common law rights apart from those that are expressly
provided in the Indian Constitution 
This trend has gradually changed 
From 1980s onwards with the advent of public interest litigation,
several rights have come under the ambit of Article 21 
Music
For example, Article 17 of ICCPR provides for right to privacy 
The American Bill of Rights was created 
This rights states that a person's privacy 
His family's privacy would not be interfered to an unreasonable extent 
Such a right is not provided in the Indian Constitution 
In the 1964 judgment of Kharak Singh versus state of Uttar Pradesh,
Supreme Court held that even though
right to privacy is not guaranteed under the Constitution 
Article 21 acts as a repository of the rights,
which are not mentioned in the Constitution,
and hence recognize the common law right to privacy 
Music
The Indian fundamental rights have borrowed
In 1997, in PUCL versus union of India
Supreme Court held that this privacy extended
to phone conversation and hence phone tapping is also violative of Article 21 
Music
Finally, in K S Puttaswamy versus Union of India 
Landmark judgment in 2017, the Supreme Court acknowledged
that right to privacy is protected under the constitutional
guarantees of Article 14,19 and 21  The right to travel abroad
is also another right  Which is not mentioned in the Indian Constitution 
Music
greatly from the American Bill of Rights 
Welcome students to the MOOC on Human Rights In India 
Article 12 of ICCPR provides the right to travel 
However, the Indian Supreme Court in 1967 
In Satwant Singh versus assistant passport officer in New Delhi
held that the right to travel is a part of Article 21 to the part of right to life 
The same was reiterated in Maneka Gandhi versus union of India 
The right to speedy trial, right to speedy trial is recognized 
Under Article 9 of ICCPR  However, there is no mention of
specifically or right with respect to speedy trial in the Indian Constitution 
ICCPR provides that any person who was arrested or detained
shall be brought before a judge and shall be entitled
In 1789  during the French Revolution,
to a trial within a reasonable period of time or to release 
The Indian Supreme Court in Hussainara Kahtoon case
held that right to speedy trial is part of fair
and just procedure, and hence part of Article 21 
Article 14 of ICCPR provides for the right to free legal assistance 
Music
Article 14 of ICCPR provides that any person who's undergoing
a criminal trial shall be entitled to legal assistance
and shall be informed of his rights  That if such legal assistance is not
available to him  The same shall be provided by the state 
certain important ideas gained acceptance in the community,
Music
A similar right does not find mentioned in the Indian Constitution 
However, in M H  Hoskot versus state of Maharashtra 
The Supreme Court held that the right to free legal assistance
is implicit in Article 21 as it is an important component of fair and just procedure 
Lastly, Article 19 of ICCPR provides for
the right to freedom of speech and expression, including the right to information 
Article 19 (1(a)) of the Indian Constitution,
as well provides the right to freedom of speech and expression 
However, the same does not extend to right to information 
and they have now formed the foundations of modern human rights law 
Music
In the landmark judgment of SP  Gupta versus Union of India 
The Supreme Court held that the right to
information is an essential tenet, essential part of our
democratic government and hence, the disclosures related to
government function should be the rule and secrecy should be an exception 
Thereby guaranteeing right to information as part of the Indian Constitution 
From this discussion, we can see that the rights 
Which are laid down in ICCPR have either been recognized
and laid down in the Indian constitution as fundamental rights
These ideas were first, liberty, also known as liberty or freedoms 
or have been recognized by the Indian judiciary as being part of the
wider ambit of right to life under Article 21 
Music
Next, we move on to the International Covenant
on social economic and cultural rights or the ICESCR 
ICESCR was ratified by India in 1976 
And thereby, India consented to be bound by the shape
and interesting feature of ICESCR 
Is that the signatories states are under an obligation to promote
and respect the rights that are laid down in the covenant 
These income past civil and political rights are the first generation rights 
However, they are not bound legally to provide for the same 
Music
These rights i mentioned in part four of the Indian constitution 
Under Directive Principles of state policy 
Just like Directive Principles of state policy 
These are not justicible in court 
They are not enforceable through a court of law 
However, the Indian judiciary has found ways to include them in interpretation
of other fundamental rights, especially article 21 
, let's discuss some of the provisions of ICSCR
Second, Egalite Or Equality  Which can be achieved
and their parallels in the Indian Constitution 
Article seven of ICESCR provides for equal pay for equal work 
The same is recognized under Article 39a
of the Indian constitution as a director of principle On equal pay for equal work 
In Randhir Singh's case the Supreme Court held
that even though the principle of equal pay for equal work
is not part of a fundamental right 
Still, as being a constitutional goal, it is enforceable through the courts mechanism 
Article 7 and 12 of the ICESCR
provide for certain medical benefits to be provided to work 
by the realization of social economic rights 
When and for the provision of healthy working conditions 
The same fine recognition in Article 38 and 39 of the Indian Constitution 
Music
The Supreme Court in regional director ESI versus Francis de Costa,
held that the provision of medical and disability benefits
to the Wokkman is part of fundamental rights under Article 21 
Article 6 of the ICESCR provides for the right livelihood
with states that every person shall have the right
to engage in livelihood which he freely chooses
and accepts ,right to livelihood is recognized in the Indian constitution 
These are also known as the second generation rights 
As part the director of principles and has
also been recognized by the Supreme Court of India 
As part of a fundamental right and the right to life article 21 
In the case of Olga TELUS versus Bombay Municipal Cooperation,
right to shelter is recognized under Article 7 of ICESCR
and the same has found recognition in the Indian constitution 
As well as through the Indian judiciary in the case of Chameli Singh 
Chameli Singh's case Supreme Court held that right to
life includes the right to food,right to water, right to decent environment,
and right to shelter  The Supreme Court expanded on the concept of shelter
Third, Fraternity, or Fraternity  These are collective rights 
to include safe and decent living structure 
Clean sorrounding and civil amenities like electricity and water supply 
Music
And we see that even though the principles 
Which are laid down in ICESCR are mostly found
in direct principles of state policy in the Indian Constitution 
Which are not justiceable in on their own  Still, the Supreme Court has found ways
to include and give force to these principles through enlarging 
The ambit of Article 21  In the end, I would like to conclude
by saying that the international bill of human rights 
Which as a community can be exercised and recognized 
Today, we are going to discuss
Which is the UDHR, ICCPR, And ICESCR have found recognition 
Under the Indian constitution as various fundamental rights
as well as director of principles of state policy 
Even the unnumbered rights  Which are not specifically laid down
in the Indian constitution have now been included
into the constitutional regime of human rights through the Supreme Court decisions 
These decisions were possible taking cue from the International covenants
and from the declaration to give effect to the international principles
by which India has found itself by ratifying these conventions 
Thank you
These are now known as the third generation rights

In 1919, International Labor Law organization was formed 
Which was one of the first international
organizations with respect to human rights 
The International Labor Organization focused on the
human rights standards of the rights of workmen 
This was part of the peace treaty of ourselves 
Music
After the first world war, League of Nations was formed with an aim to ensure
the module on international human rights law and the Indian Constitution 
that such a war does not take place again through international corporation 
However, the efforts of bringing the international community together 
Under the ages of human rights, and also providing an effective remedy
to those whose rights have been violated was not successful 
through the League of Nations 
This led to the Second World War 
after which the United Nations was formed in 1945 
And the United Nations Charter was adopted in 1945 
It can be said that United Nations came into existence to save the
future generations from the scourge of wars
International human rights law is part of the larger discipline of international law 
like the First World War and the Second World War 
Article One of the United Nations Charter lays down
as one of the important goals of UN to promote and encourage 
The respect of human rights without any distinction of race, sex,
caste, creed, language or religion  The language of human rights 
First found recognition in the covenants of League of Nations 
At the time of drafting of the United Nations Charter 
It was discussed that "Declaration on the essential rights of man"
should be added into the charter 
However, this required a longer deliberation 
Music
Which was not possible at that particular meeting 
Hence, in the first session in 1947 
It was discussed that a preliminary bill on
international human rights would be drafted 
The drafting was later given to a commission of eight states 
These states were chosen to ensure maximum participation across
the international community, keeping in mind the geographical locations 
The International bill of human rights comprises of three documents 
The first is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights UDHR 
Which was adopted in 1948  The second is
International human rights law promotes the development of
the International Covenant of civil and political rights or the ICCPR 
Which was ratified in 1976  The third is
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, or the ICESCR 
Which was also ratified in 1976, after most of the states
became signatories to it, at the time of drafting of
the International bill of human rights, it was discussed
that two documents shall be created
one in the form of a declaration 
Which would lay down the standards of human rights across the international community 
And second, in the form of a covenant, which would lay down
human rights across social, regional and domestic levels 
specific rights and limitations 
Which would be legally binding
on the states that became signatories to it 
However, at the time of drafting of the covenants 
There was a split between the international community as some favor to civil
and political rights and some favored economic and social rights 
Because of this, the covenant was divided into two parts
and hence now we have ICCPR  Which focuses on Civil and Political Rights
and ICESCR, which focuses on economic, social and cultural rights 
Now let's discuss the Indian Constitution and the human rights 
The Binding effect of international human rights law
Which have been recognized under the Indian Constitution 
There are several rights which are laid down in UDHR, or ICCPR 
And ICSCR, which find recognition in the Indian Constitution 
The in alienable rights, which are also known as
the fundamental rights are enshrined and part three of the Constitution 
These rights are couched in a negative language,
which ensures that certain instructions are given to the state 
They are to act as a limitation on the power of the state
with respect to executive and legislative functions,
and hence violations of the fundamental rights are to be avoided by the state 
comes from the various treaties that have been signed between
the requirement of Locus standi,
thereby enabling a public spirited
Music
group to bring forward a case concerning public interest 
Music
There was another case where
three ministers of government of Maharashtra sold
Music
land at lower rates to some person 
Music
for instance, the three wings of the state, namely the legislature,
Pillow Modi complaint against government of Maharashtra
in this matter before a court of law,
and the respondents claimed that Pillow Modi
did not have Locus standi in this matter,
but the court, the judge rejected the contention altogether 
See here is a case involving corruption free administration 
Here is a matter involving public interest at large
and the having regard to these issues 
The court rejected the contention of the respondents
that Pillow Modi did not have Locus standi 
the executive, the judiciary have their respective roles
In fact, the Supreme Court has been very careful not to enlarge
this relaxation of locus standi to criminal matters, or service matters 
In fact, in one such matter,
there was in what is regard called
Panchhi versus State of Uttar Pradesh
Music
There was a case involving death sentence to a woman 
The supreme court rejected the intervention of
even a statutory body like the National Commission for Women 
So in other words, in certain matters,
for the protection and promotion of human rights
the traditional rule of Locus standi was relaxed, but
this did not apply to the criminal matters or service matters 
The Supreme Court gave guidelines clearly mentioning that
PIL cannot be maintained by middle some interlopers,
busybodies, wayfarers and those who have no public interests
and those who file only purely for personal gain or publicity 
Another important characteristic of PIL is what can be called as
a letter petitions the technical term for it is epistolary jurisdiction 
In simple terms, it means
Music
and the civil society also contributes to this effort 
anybody can approach the Supreme Court
through a postcard or a letter or a telegram 
In fact, these days telegram is not in vogue, but
about three decades back telegram was used to draw
attention to urgent matters 
Music
In fact,
Music
access to courts is an important issue 
And often it is said that there is a class bias
We have also seen the human rights provisions
and only a rich people can affort the best of the lawyers
and in terms of filing etc  There is a huge transactional costs,
but when you accept
Music
a matter relating to public importance,
through a postcard or a letter or a telegram,
it opens floodgates, it opens access
to justice for the poor or marginalized persons 
There are many examples in this letter petitions 
For instance, S P Gupta versus Union of India case or a judge's case 
in the constitution of India under Part 3,
Sunil Batra relating to the prisoners rights,
Music
Sheela Barse and D K  Basu, both have brought
Music
to the attention of the Supreme Court,
the custodial violence and custodial deaths and those
letters were in fact treated as are converted into a public
interest petition and thereafter, the court gave a
series of important directions 
Music
dealing with fundamental rights and part 4 dealing with
In fact, in 1988, the Supreme Court issued a notification
on what kind of petitions will not be entertainable 
The Supreme Court said issues relating to bonded labour,
neglected children or petitions seg sent by prisoners
or atrocities on women, children shedule caste,
shedule tribes etc will be entertainable as PIL 
On the other hand,
landlord-tenant disputes,
Music
service matters,
Music
Music
admission to medical colleges or other educational institutions
will not be entertained as PIL 
Music
The other important characteristic of PIL is that it is a done in a
non-adversarial manner here there are no
contending parties 
Traditional mode, there are lawyers who argued the case on either side 
And the judge decides either for or against a party 
In the public interest litigation,
directive principles of state policy 
all of them are working towards a particular cause for
resolution of a issue relating to public interest at large 
So here, the courts, the lawyers, the judges, they all work in tandem
to find or resolve issue which is of great, immense public interest 
And the purpose of this non adversarial mode is
to make human rights meaningful to
the persons belonging to marginalized or vulnerable communities 
Music
Another important characteristic of PIL is
the appointment of a PIL petitioner or amicus curiae 
Let us take up how judiciary enforces these fundamental rights 
Dear students,
Here the Supreme Court appoints a person
often is a senior advocate of the court
as a amicus curiae to aid the matter 
And here the person becomes public interest litigation petitioner
or he or she doesn't have any stake in the matter,
but they assist the court in the resolution of the issue
they present all facts and circumstances 
Music
Let me give you an example 
Music
What is public interest litigation all about ?
There was a case filed by extra judicial execution victims families 
It's a Manipur based non governmental organization 
It's an organization of widows whose husbands had been killed
and it is in short, it's called Eefam versus Union of India 
Here the supreme court
Music
appointed a senior counsel, Maneka Guruswamy
as an amicus curiae to assist the court
in getting to the bottom of the complaint of
which involves about 1500
How is it defined ?
deaths in encounters or extrajudicial executions 
Now,
Music
there is one other important element relating to the PIL
that is that our appointment of commissions or commissioners,
here, the Supreme Court appoints
Music
some eminent persons be civil servants, journalists, academics
or others to assist the court in investigating the matter,
and where there is sufficient information is not available
What is the purpose of PIL ?
to the court for instance, moved by the
starvation deaths in some pockets of the country 
The people's union for civil liberties,
moved a public interest petition before the Supreme Court of India,
in what is known as right to food case 
Here, the court appointed a former civil servant,
Mr  NC Saxena as a commissioner to assist it 
Subsequently, Mr  Harshmander was also appointed as a commissioner
to give the details there was a case brought
to the attention of the Supreme Court by Sheela Barse
What are its unique characteristics ?
about the custodial violence
faced by the woman undertrial prisoners in Maharashtra 
In that case, the court appointed Armaiti Desai was who was a
known social worker reputed social worker
to go deep into the issue and place relevant information
before the Supreme Court 
Music
There was a case involving Indian Council for
enviro legal action,
which is a non governmental organization versus Union of India,
Music
this case related to the groundwater or soil pollution 
In this case, the supreme court appointed Nagpur based
National Environmental Engineering Research Institute
to assistant and monitor the issue and submit reports to it 
In conclusion, public interest litigation
has contributed a great deal to social change 
It has helped prisoners
who have been languishing for long periods of time
and people who are living in subhuman conditions in mental hospitals,
women remand homes, or children in hazardous occupations or factories 
And how does it differ from the traditional methods
There were a series of innovative
steps that have been taken one was judicial monitoring of
institutions and also fashioning a new regime of human rights,
democratizing access to justice, fashioning new kinds of relief,
and also in many-many other aspects, so PIL has contributed
immensely to gender justice, environmental justice and also
bonded labour and many other important areas 
There are, a few drawbacks 
Some people have filed petitions
Music
in fact, PIL can be regarded as a tool
and the for publicity and or for
sometimes corporate interests try to masquerade as public
interest and corporates wanted to settle battles among
themselves through the PIL 
In such cases, the court frowned upon such practices
and often imposed huge costs on the petitioners 
At the whole, PIL has been a great revolution
and a great in the annals of the Indian judicial history 
And in the coming modules we will see in greater detail
PIL's contribution in individually areas 
which has been crafted by

judiciary,
the MOOC on human rights in India, week three we take up
Music
through Judicial creativity, through judicial innovation
and public interest litigation as the word litigation connotes,
it's a kind of a action before a court of law
to further general interest or common interests or public interests 
PIL can be defined as a kind of constitutional adjudication
in pursuit of constitutional justice
promoting the concept of a welfare state 
Music
And the purpose of PIL is access to justice 
today introduction to public interest litigation 
In fact there are people who on account of their poverty,

violations 
What are the unique characteristics of public interest litigation 
Students, let us now turn our attention to the unique characteristics of
public interest litigation and also see
how it differs from the traditional modes of dispute resolution 
In fact, four important characteristics can be shown as a
unique characteristics of PIL 
Number one relaxation of procedural requirements
appointment of commission's or commissioners by the court 
As we have earlier seen
Music
PIL petitioners or appointment of Amicus Curiae 
And fourth,
Music
the whole thing is conducted in a non adversarial manner 
Music
We will see each of these aspects in greater detail 
For instance, first let us take up the relaxation of the
procedural requirements 
The traditional rule is that only a person who is affected
Music
can approach a court of law whenever his or her constitutionally
guaranteed fundamental rights are infringed
with the request for a remedy
In what can be regarded as a truly a judicial revolution
cases involving grievances and concerns of
public at large can also be brought to the attention of the court
by a non governmental organization or by a civil society group
or any person 
So in other words,
Music
there is National Human rights protection system
the traditional mode,
it was a   only an affected individual could approach
Music
the court of law
Music
whenever his or her rights are infringed 
Human_rights_in_india_5815
Music
somebody can agitate before the court
relating to causes where public interest is a stake 
Music
The supreme court also relaxed what is known as Locus standi 
Music
What is meant by Locus standi ?
Locus standi means a person, whose
Music
rights are violated can alone approach the court of law 
In a landmark case called
Municipal Council of Ratlam Versus Vardhichand and others 
Justice Krishna Iyer relaxed
Music
with responsibilities of different organs laid down
It has affected the hydrological balance 
And the court said it's very important to ensure that
people have a right to
Music
live in a clean environment and particularly,
their cattle, their home, their lands shall not be affected by
pollution of air, water and other pollution 
It has ordered the closure of these illegal limestone quarries 
In the case of Godavarman Thirumalpad versus Union of India,
the court came down heavily on the certain companies and the state
Music
for neglecting its duties under the Constitution of India 
It has asked the government of Himachal Pradesh
to pay a sum of rupees 1 crore as fine for allowing painting
by certain companies of advertisements on the fragile rock faces
on the way from Rohtang to Manali 
So, the court
Music
said the no this is not permissible,
the protection of environment is extremely important
and it has also ordered
Article 21 of the Constitution of India,
the companies whose advertisements were displayed to pay 1 crore each
and create a corpus of a sum of rupees 5 crore,
which shall be used to restore the ecology that was damaged by
painting of the rock faces by through these advertisements 
Music
In the case of Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board versus M V  Naidu
the supreme court held that
Music
a citizen has a right to clean drinking water 
And it held that this right is a part of the article 21 dealing with
how it has been expanded by the courts 
right to life 
In fact, the court said the access to clean drinking water
in sufficient quality and quantity shall be provided
as a part of the basic needs of a citizen 
Let us turn our attention to the water pollution 
M C  Mehta, one of the
Music
ardent environmental activists has moved several cases
to the Supreme Court of India 
In one such case, he drew the attention of the court
In fact, Article 21 says, no person shall be
to the operation of certain tanneries which were leaving
pollutants in the river Ganga and costing and environmental damage,
and the court
Music
asked these tanneries to install sewage treatment plants
Music
and treat the water before discharging it into the river Ganga 
And the court said
Music
the financial capacity of the tanneries is totally irrelevant,
deprived of his life and personal liberty except
and they have a duty to ensure that they do not discharge
polluted, untreated water into the river Ganges 
As a result of this order many polluting tanneries were
closed  M C  Mehta has also filed
a public interest litigation regarding the damage caused to Taj Mahal
as result of atmospheric pollution 
He mentioned that the refineries that were operating in Mathura
and the industries that were operating in the neighboring areas,
were releasing sulfur dioxide fumes into the air and
which was affecting the Taj Mahal as you know, Taj is a
in accordance with the procedure established by law 
world heritage monument
it's a part of our cultural heritage
and the supreme court having regard to the gravity of the issue,
issue directions asking the coal based and cope based industries
in the what is called Taj trapezium zone to
either switch to natural gas or relocate in another area
as per the Agra master Plan 
The Supreme Court also asked the Union of India and the state government
to release funds for maintenance of trees and
plants in and around Taj Mahal 
So this article 21 dealing with the right to life and personal liberty
Music
In another case, Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad,
which is a non governmental organization filed a PIL
Music
regarding the environmental damage that is proposed to be caused by
a silent valley project 
And the petitioner mentioned that
no proper environmental impact assessment was done
as a result of this case eventually,
the government abandoned the Silent Valley project 
has been interpreted or has been expanded by the Supreme Court
Let me turn your attention to another important case
called Bichhri village case or hitch acid case 
Here, a non governmental organization called Indian Council for
Enviro Legal Action,
filed a PIL before the Supreme Court of India,
drawing its attention to a certain chemical industries, which are operating
in a village called Bichhri near Udaipur and they were releasing
highly toxic materials and which was damaging the
groundwater, the land and it was causing
enormous environmental damage 
to include the right to health and right to pollution free environment 
Now, having regard to this the
Supreme Court asked National Environmental Engineering Research Institute
or NEERI to ascertain facts on the ground 
And they NEERI said NEERI confirm about the damage
cause to the environment and how these industries
did not take proper approvals from the statutory authorities
did not obtain proper license, but we're operating
in the village and were destroying the environment 
So the court order remedial measures to stop
a prevention of water pollution
In the international efforts towards
Dear students,
and other pollution caused by the operation of these chemical industries 
The Supreme Court also entertained a number of public interest litigation
with regard to the smoking in public places
or air pollution in Delhi  In one case what is called the
Oleum gas leak case which is a very significant one 
It there was the Sri Ram Food and Fertilizers
was operating a highly hazardous industry in the Delhi
and there was a release of oleum gas and which affected
a lot of people living in the neighboring vicinity 
And in this case, the Supreme Court said
protection of environment and sustainable development,
any enterprise which is operating in highly hazardous chemicals
and the release of which affected the civilian population,
and that enterprise is absolutely liable
to compensate people affected by the
such a gas leak  And this kind, this absolute liablity
does not allow for any exceptions whatsoever 
Music
You all know, the Bhopal gas disaster, which occurred on December 3rd of 1984
where over three thousands people perished,
and nearly two hundred thousand people were injured
Stockholm conference or Stockholm declaration
when highly lethal methyl isocyanate was know
leaked from Union Carbide factory 
And again here, the Supreme Court of India
mediated a settlement and ordered
four hundred and seventy million dollars
for the victims to settle past, present and future claims 
And here, the Supreme Court invoke the extra ordinary jurisdiction
and the Supreme Court sighting the enormity of the
human tragedy and human suffering underlying the need for
dispersal of immediate and substantial relief to the victims 
that was adopted in the year 1972 is a major milestone 
Students in this module,
we have seen the constitutional provisions,
the legislative provisions with regard to the protection
and improvement of natural environment 
We have also seen how NGOs and public spirited citizens
have moved the Supreme Court and other High Courts
with a view to honor a range of matters
with a view to protect environment 
And so that way the public interest litigation
has contributed in a very significant manner
It asked all states to adopt legislative measures
to the evolution of environmental jurisprudence
in the country 
Thank you 
and see you in the next module 
Music
to protect environment 
In pursuance India also has amended the constitution of India 
In fact article 48A was inserted in the chapter dealing
with the directive principles of state policy 
If you look at the article 48A,
it asks the state to protect and improve
welcome to MOOC on Human Rights In India 
natural environment including forests, and wildlife 
Music
So here is a obligation cast on the state,
while framing legislations to keep article 48 A in view
and prepare legislations accordingly 
Music
While article 48A cast obligation on the state
there is a similar duty cast on the citizens through
an amendment in the
article dealing with the fundamental duties of citizens
Over the course of this module and the next module,
under article 51A in fact, a clause (G) was inserted in article 51A
requiring every citizen imposing a duty on every citizen
to protect environment and improve environment, including forests,
wildlife, rivers, lakes etc 
So these are in some list of constitutional provisions or goals
relating to protection of environment 
A number of legislations were also adopted by the parliament
for instance there was a water prevention and control of pollution act
was adopted in the year, 1974 
It was supplemented by a water cess act a few years later 
we will see public interest litigation and environment in detail 
And in the same way there was an air
prevention and control of pollution act was adopted in the year 1981 
And environmental protection act of 1986 is an important landmark
legislation in this regard 
And there was a wildlife protection act,
forest conservation act and national green tribunal acts
were adopted by the parliament 
There are more legislations
that were adopted to deal with the issue of protection
and improvement of environment 
We have earlier seen the introduction to public interest litigation
These have been complemented by a number of policies that were adopted
dealing with let's say national water policy, or the use of batteries
or plastic waste or hazardous materials
and their disposal, construction debri, and many other aspects 
Having seen the constitutional provisions
the various legislations and policies,
let us now turn our attention to the important cases
adjudicated by the Supreme Court of India and the other higher courts 
Music
For instance, in Ratlam Municipality versus Vardhichand 
and its contribution in other areas 
The supreme court relaxed or extended the scope of Locus standi
in the case of environmental matters 
The traditional rule of Locus standi requires that
only an affected person whose right has been infringed,
can move the court of law and seek a remedy 
So the court said in matters concerning protection of basic environment,
natural environment there could be petitions from
public spirited citizens 
So in this particular case, the court ordered the Ratlam municipality
to provide sanitation and drainage 
The protection and improvement of natural environment
Music
And it rejected the argument advanced by the
Ratlam municipality of resources or lack of resources
and said it had a duty to protect the public health and
discharge the right to clean environment 
This case is very significant in the sense that
it opened a silent legal revolution
and led to a number of many other matters coming to the
Supreme Court and other High Courts regarding environment 
Let's see another interesting case,
is one of the key areas for the public interest litigation 
Music
which was filed by Rural Litigation, Entitlement Kendra or RLEK
against the government of Uttar Pradesh 
In fact, it was started as letter petition to the Supreme Court
and the Supreme Court treated as a writ petition 
The issue involved is about illegal limestone quarries
operating in the hills near Mussooire and Dehradun
and the operation of these illegal limestone quarries
has affected the natural environment 
It has affected the fragile ecosystem 
In fact, we have already seen
Music
There have been many other cases
Music
which went to the Supreme Court and using this precautionary principle,
the court
Music
gave directions about noise pollution
by in the process of construction of multi storied buildings
in Chennai or the environmental damage caused by
shrimp culture or aquaculture
second aspect of the PIL and the environment 
in the coastal Zones 
Having considered the precautionary principles,
let us turn our attention to the
second principle relating to polluter pays 
Music
In other words,
Music
in the international environmental law,
there is a principle which lays down that
the polluter has the liability to pay for the damage
In the last module we saw how a number of matters
caused to the environment  In the last module, we saw the
Bichhri village case where a non governmental organization namely
the Indian Council for Enviro Legal Action, filed a case
against Union of India about the operation of a
Music
firm near Udaipur
which is you know involved in hazardous chemicals,
and it was damaging the groundwater,
it was damaging the soil 
And in this case, again, the Supreme Court endorsed the
came before the Supreme Court and other High Courts
polluter pays principle and held that
the absolute liability of the firm
that is operating the particular concern and which is polluting
the environment must compensate all individuals who have been
affected by the damage to the environment 
And the court also held that the absolute liability of that firm
also extends to the remediation of the damaged environment 
In other words, the court must compensate the individuals affected
but also ensure the environment
must be restored to the previous position,
regarding environmental issues 
which was there before its operation 
Here, it's very important to note that there are two aspects 
One is prevention of damage to the environment and
second is the remediation of damage to the environment 
There are two aspects involved here,
one is, efforts to prevent damage to the environment 
And second is remediation of damaged environment 
The court held that cost should not be passed on to the government 
And it's not the government that has to take
these efforts and which the court said will become a liability
We will see in this module, what kind of principles,
of the taxpayer and the court in fact held that the form that is
damaging the natural environment is liable or as absolutely liable
for payment of the costs to the villagers who have been affected
by its operations and also for restoration 
Remediation of environment
has also been held to be a part of sustainable development 
There is one more case under the polluter pays principle
which was filed by M C  Mehta 
Here its known as of course, the Calcutta tanneries case
and the court ordered for the relocation of the polluting
what kind of doctrines have been used by the higher judiciary 
industries and also asked them to pay 25% of the land costs 
Let us turn our attention to the third principle of absolute liability 
Generally in tort law
Music
there are two major issues 
One is intentional wrongdoing and second is a negligent wrongdoing 
And in the case of Rayland versus Fletcher, certain exceptions were
noted basically in fact for the negligent wrongdoing,
there is a strict liability but the
exceptions being act of God or wish major or plaintiffs consent
You are all aware of the public interest litigation,
or act of stranger or statutory authority 
In so far as matters relating to conservation of environment
or protection of environment is concerned 
The Supreme Court held that
there is an absolute liability of the
Music
unit that is damaging the natural environment 
In other words, there can be no exceptions whatsoever
if a firm is engaged in a hazardous
Music
how the higher judiciary has used judicial innovation,
activities it has an absolute liability 
Let me illustrate with a case which was taken by
M C  Mehta against the
Sri Ram Chemicals and a Sri Ram Food and Fertilizers and Union of India 
In what is also known as Oleum gas leak case
here there was a firm which was engaged in a patently
hazardous chemical processes and in the release of this
toxic oleum gas affected lot of civilians and
so, the court held that the firm had an absolute liability
on account of its the hazardous nature of the activities
judicial creativity to craft new strategies to come out with
it was engaged in 
Let us turn or attention to the
fourth principle of sustainable development 
Music
If you look at the Brundtland report,
which was commissioned by the United Nations,
Music
the sustainable development has been defined as
that process of development which meets the needs of the
current generation without compromising on the ability of
new remedies through this public interest litigation 
Dear students,
future generations to meet their own needs 
Here the on the one hand,
the principle of economics, on the other hand,
the ecology have to be integrated
and at all levels of decision making 
And in the number of cases, the Supreme Court upheld the
principle of sustainable development 
if you look at the Vellore citizens forum v  Union of India,
which involved the release of untreated waters by the
Tamil Nadu tanneries 
In particular we will see
The Supreme Court said that the sustainable development
is extremely critical for eradicating poverty
for improving the quality of human life and the court also said
the pollution should be compensate
with the carrying capacity of the eco system 
In a number of other cases, the Supreme Court upheld
the principle of sustainable development in particular
in M C  Mehta versus Union of India, apex court
highlighted the need to strike a balance between the needs of
development on the one hand and the
Music
demands of the conservation
of environment on the other hand 
In N D  Jayal versus Union of India,
the Supreme Court said that, right to clean environment
and right to development are both part of the article 21
dealing with the right to life  And the court also said,
sustainable development is a means to achieve the both the
right to development as well as right to life in shrine
that the article 21 of the Constitution 
let us turn our attention to the fifth principle
the polluter pays principles, precautionary principles,
of the public trust doctrine  What do we understand by the
term public trust doctrine? Here, there are certain resources
like air
Music
river, water or forests or seas  They belong to everyone,
regardless of economic capacity,
and should be enjoyed by all 
Music
And there's one matter which went to the apex court, which involved
the case between M C  Mehta and Kamal Nath 
and the principle of absolute liability
I'll tell you the facts of the case 
So there was a span motels, which was given
some land in forest in the form of a lease,
and they tried to divert the river Beas water, the flow of
the river as it was flooding the motel time and again 
So the court came down heavily on them and said it violated the
principle of the public trust doctrine and cancel the lease of
the forest land to expand motels and also ordered after following
the due process pollution fine of rupees 10 lakhs 
Let me draw your attention to one more case involving
and the sustainability development and
M I  Builders versus Radhey Shyam Sahu here the facts are as follows
Music
there was a historical park in Lucknow called Jhandewala Park and
there was a proposal to build an underground shopping complex
below that park and in this case, a lot of it was already
constructed, but the court took the stand that here is a public trust
involved and as it was a park which was for the benefit
of everybody and the court ordered the Lucknow Nagar Maha palika
and to ensure that the that as the park is a common resource,
which are to be enjoyed by all it rejected the
Music
construction of the underground shopping complex below the park 
So, in a sum or in conclusion, we have seen the precautionary
principle, the polluter pays principle and the sustainable
development   principle absolute liability and the public trust doctrine
on how the Supreme Court through the process of
public interest litigation do the process of creating number
of innovative and creative processes and strategies applied
in a range of cases and upheld them in this process 
Thank you 
See you in the next module 
the public trust doctrine in this particular module 
Music
Let us take up each of these principles and doctrine for
greater examination 
First let us see, the precautionary principles 
Welcome to MOOC on Human Rights In India 
Basically it involves an examination whether a
particular development process is environmentally sustainable or not 
Music
Any substance or activity which is posing a threat to
the environment should be prevented from damaging it 
And here the onus is on the actor
on the developer and the industrialist to show that
his or her actions or environmentally sound 
Let me give you few examples of cases
which went before the Supreme Court 
In the last module, we saw how a number of matters came before the
For instance in Vellore citizens forum versus Union of India,
which is otherwise known as Tamil Nadu tanneries case 
Music
The operation of tanneries
Music
polluted
Music
the groundwater made hundreds of acres of lands
in five districts 
Uncultivable and in this case,
Supreme Court and other High Courts regarding environmental issues 
Justice Kuldeep Singh who is known as a green judge,
held that polluter pays principle,
precautionary principle
Music
and sustainable development
are all part of a Environmental Law 
And so here
Music
in the process of interpreting the law,
the Supreme Court said
In this module, we will see what principles and what
Music
as long as certain principles of
customary international environmental law,
if they are not in conflict with the municipal law
can be relied upon and thus,
the court read
the precautionary principle or the polluter pays principle
or the Sustainable Development principle into the Indian law 
And here the court clearly
mentioned that these tanneries should not release water without
doctrines have been used by the higher judiciary in the process
proper water treatment plants 
Let us now take up M C  Mehta versus Union of India
as you know in the M C  Mehta one of
the finest environmental activists and he filed a number of cases
in one case which is otherwise known as Taj Mahal case
certain coke and cold base plants in the Taj trapezium area
were causing serious atmospheric pollution and they were
endangering world renowned and   protected monument
which is regarded as a part of a world heritage 
Now, in this case, the court having regard to the
of public interest litigation  Dear students, welcome to MOOC
precautionary principle, having regard to the
polluter pays principle asked for a relocation
of the is coal and coke based industries and the court also
said that this particular precautionary principle and
polluter pays principle are part of the environmental law of India 
Let's come to the one more case file by M C  Mehta which is known as
M C Mehta (II) versus Union of India, which is also known as
Ganga river water case  Here, the court having regard to
the precautionary principle directed all the municipalities
on the banks of the Ganga River to ensure that there is no
on Human Rights In India 
effluents, no untreated effluents are released into the river Ganga 
In one case filed by M C  Mehta
Music
involving vehicular pollution in the metropolis of Delhi,
in the capital city of delhi,
the supreme court order that vehicles which are more than
20 years old should not be allowed to be operated in the capital city,
in the interests of
Music
preventing damage to the environment 
In this module, we will take up the
Music
Right to compensation has been recognized as an integral part of
right to life and liberty under article 21 of the Indian Constitution 
The National Commission for women NCW
was directed to evolve a scheme for providing
adequate safeguards to these victims 
Let me turn to another important case
Chairman Railway Board versus Chandrima Das 
Music
The facts of the case are as follows Chandrima Das was a
Bangladeshi national and she was raped by
Music
Music
few
Music
government personnel, railway personnel in a rail yatri nivas
Music
and
Music
this case was brought to the Supreme Court
as a public interest petition
and the court ordered
what are the broad principles laid down by the Supreme Court of India 
Music
a sum of 10 lakh compensation to the victim
and held that
Music
even a foreign national is entitled to protection
of the right to life under article 21 
In a number of other cases involving rape
Music
the Supreme Court followed on the
broad guidelines or parameters issued in the case of
As u have seen in the earlier modules,
Delhi Domestic Working Women's Forum 
Let us turn our attention to another important
facet of the PIL relating to gender justice 
namely the sexual harassment of women at the workplace 
There was a class action brought by a series of
public spirited individuals
and non governmental organization which came to be known as a
Vishakha versus state of Rajasthan,
the facts of the case are as follows 
There was a social worker who was carrying on with her work,
public interest litigation enables
but who was brutally gang raped in a village in Rajasthan 
This case is important for several reasons,
here is a violation of article 14,
relating to right to equality and article 15 
Article 19 dealing with right to practice, profess any trade
or profession and also article 21 dealing with right to life and
personal liberty 
There was no legislation dealing with
sexual harassment of women at the workplace at that point of time 
However, the convention on the elimination of all forms of
Music
discrimination against women 
Which is known as by acronym CEDAW
Music
has issued a general comment terming any such
harassment as a discrimination against women as a part of the
violence against women in the absence of legislation to
framework at that point of time, the Supreme Court came out with
a series of guidelines 
Which requires employers to prevent cases of
sexual harassment of women at the workplace 
people who for economic or other reasons,
The supreme court defined sexual harassment
Music
as including such, quote, unwelcome, unquote 
Sexually determined behaviour, whether directly
or by implication as:
Number one physical contact and advances,
number two a demand or requests for sexual favours,
number three sexually coloured remarks,
number four showing pornography,
number five any other unwelcome physical,
are unable to approach a court of law for redressal of their grievances 
verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature 
Detailed guidelines have also been laid down
to be observed amongst others on the duty of the employer
to prevent, deter, resolve and prosecute such behaviour
as well as institute a complaints mechanism 
Let us turn our attention to the
another case dealing with right to food 
People's union for civil liberties PUCL moved a PIL
before the Supreme Court of India drawing attention to
starvation deaths in Rajasthan  Later on, the supreme court
Music
expanded the ambit of that case to cover all states of the
Union of India
and issued a series of interium orders on the operation of
integrated Child Development Scheme and other anti poverty schemes 
In particular the supreme court ordered that food should be provided to
destitute women and children, pregnant woman and lactating mothers 
In fact, the supreme court held that right to food not only includes
the provision of food, but also includes
right to adequate nutrition 
A few cases were brought before the Supreme Court of India
In fact, under this bonded labourers, destitute woman and children,
in the form of PIL's  regarding service conditions,
there was a celebrated case of Muthamma
which discriminated women who joined government of India
to notify them of the marriage and there was a
Nargeesh Meerza versus Air India case 
And There were other cases which
discriminated women and prevented them from working
in factories in night shifts  And in all these cases,
the supreme court redressed and you know, the removed the
discrimination underlying in those cases 
and other vulnerable sections have approach the supreme court
Dear students
Sheela Barsy was a journalist working in Maharashtra 
She was deeply moved by the custodial violence
faced by women under trial prisoners
and she wrote a letter to the Supreme Court of India
on the problems faced by women prisoners 
And in response, the Supreme Court gave number of directions
on the protection of women under trials,
particularly from the custodial violence 
To conclude we see that public interest litigation
has enabled academics, NGOs,
and the higher judiciary, through public spirited citizens
Music
social workers, journalists and other public spirited individuals
to bring such important cases faced by
marginalized, vulnerable women and
Music
in this process, such broad and other landmark guidelines
were given by the Supreme Court to handle cases such as rape
or sexual harassment of women at the workplace 
Let me in conclusion and one other important aspect of
female infanticide and foeticide
or non governmental organizations and took up a range of issues
we know in Indian society patriarchy is prevalent
as a result of son buyers there was a selective abortion of
female fetus which distorted the sex ratio
in many districts of the country 
Music
In response to it, the government came out with a legislation called
prenatal diagnostics act, there was
Music
CEHAT which was a research organization 
MASUM which was a non governmental organization 
for redressal of their grievances or violations of their rights 
And Dr  Sabu George a public spirited individual came together
and brought to that attention of the Supreme Court of India about the
poor implementation of the prenatal diagnostics act 
Music
In response, the Supreme Court gave a series of guidelines 
It asked the government to create more public awareness
about the female infanticide and foeticide 
It asked the government to amend the act
and also appoint appropriate authorities
in various states and constitute national
Let us take up a few important cases which came to the
Music
inspection and monitoring authorities 
In response lot of action has happened 
Music
The legislation was amended and a new legislation by the name
pre- conception and pre-natal diagnostics act has been brought
and enacted by the parliament, there have been further measures to
prosecute errant doctors and also clinics
which practice female foeticide 
Music
supreme court in this process 
In conclusion PIL as advanced the cause of gender justice
in a number of ways and it also led to the
development of guidelines, legislations yet
there is a long way to traverse before we
Music
secure, full equality for women and full gender justice 
Music
Music
The first one is about conditions of women in the
women's remand home at Agra 
Music
Upendra Baxi one of the finest legal scholars and an academic
Welcome to a MOOC on Human Rights In India 
was deeply moved by the appalling conditions
Music
of the women's remand home at Agra
and he moved a public interest litigation
before the Supreme Court of India 
And the court gave a series of directions
Music
to redress the issue and also protect the rights of the inmates
and ask the National Human Rights Commission
to monitor the conditions in the Agra protective home 
Music
I'll tell you why this case is very significant 
Music
The Supreme Court also asked
the National Human Rights Commission to monitor
the conditions in Agra mental hospital, Ranchi and Gwalior 
Music
And the commission
Music
later on extended it to all the mental hospitals in the country
and appointed a special rapporteur
We start week five with the first module on
Music
who undertook many visits and
documented the short comings in institutions 
And these have led to
Music
important recommendations to the state government's
concerned and also to the central government
and this monitoring has led to a series of improvements
in the women's remand home at Agra
at other mental hospitals across the country 
public interest litigation and gender justice 
Let us turn to a case of sexual assault 
Delhi domestic working women's forum is a non governmental organization 
It moved a public interest petition before the Supreme Court of India
regarding a case of sexual assault 
As you know, rape, sexual assault causes a
deep and long lasting impact 
It has a psychological impact on the victim 
There is a guilt and there are other serious trauma
which is undergone by the victim 
Often the trial of these cases, re-victimizes the person who is involved 
What are the learning outcomes for this module?
Let me tell you the facts of this case, there were
five domestic workers who were travelling by a train from
Ranchi to Delhi 
And they were assaulted by eight army personnel
and so in this case, the supreme court gave a series of guidelines
on maintaining anonymity of rape victims,
legal representation to be provided to the victims
and compensation and the rehabilitation of these victims 
In fact, the supreme court order that interim compensation
can be given to them even without the conviction of the offenders 
In fact, we aim to see how public interest litigation has
It is a which is a very important principle indeed 
In fact these are known as broad parameters for the trial of rape cases 
Let me tell you these broad parameters 
Music
The complainents of sexual assault cases
should be provided with legal representation 
Legal Assistance should be provided at the police station
since the victim may be in a distressed state 
The police should be under a duty to inform the victim
of her right to a counsel before being interrogated 
further or advanced principle of gender justice 
A list of lawyers willing to act in these cases
should be kept at the police station 
Music
In all rape trials, anonymity of the victim must be maintained 
Music
Noting that rape victims frequently incur
substantial financial loss and some of them are too traumatized
to continue in employment  The Supreme Court observed that
it is necessary to set up a Criminal Injuries Compensation Board 
Music
And why doing so
is a non governmental organization and deeply moved by
the plight of labourers, who are working in stone quarries in
Faridabaad in the state of Haryana 
Swami Agnivesh wrote a letter to the Supreme Court of India 
He said there were labourers from different parts of the country
working in these a stone quarries 
He also held that many of them were working under inhuman
and intolerable conditions Swami Agnivesh
held that most of them were bonded labourers, and that
various social welfare legislations enacted by the government,
what principles have been laid down by the apex court?
were not reaching these labourers 
In fact, he gave the names of each of these stone queries,
as well as the names of the labourers 
To the supreme court with a request to issue writs 
In response to this serious human rights violation 
The Supreme Court gave a number of directions
the gist of the supreme court orders in the bundhua mukti morcha case is as follows 
Whenever it is shown that a labourer is made to provide
forced labour, the court would raise a presumption that
he is required to do so in consideration of an advance
What is bonded labour?
or other economic consideration,
and he's there for a bonded labourer 
This presumption may be rebutted by the employer
and also by the state government if it chooses 
But unless and until satisfactory material is produced
for rebutting this presumption, the court must proceed
on the basis that the labourer is a bonded labourer,
entitled to the benefits under the provisions of the bonded
labour system abolishan act  Government of Haryana should,
without any further delay, and within six weeks from
Here a person takes a debt or advance or a loan from another,
16 December 1983, constitute a vigilance committee
in each subdivision of a district  Government of Haryana will instruct
the district magistrates of all the districts in the state
to take up the work of identification of bonded labour 
As one of their top priority tasks 
The state government should drop within three months on 16th December 1983 
A scheme for rehabilitation of
freed bonded labourers in the light of the guidelines sent By Ministry
of Labour Secretary on second September 1982,
the central and state governments will take all necessary steps
say a creditor, and in lieu of which
for the purpose of ensuring that minimum wages are paid directly to the Workman
employed in the stone quarries and stone crushers
and not through middlemen  , let me
take you through another important landmark order passed by the Supreme Court 
In the Neerja Chaudhury what's the state of Madhya Pradesh case 
In facts of the case are as follows in the wake of
judgment issued by the Supreme Court of India in 1982,
relating to the wanted labourers in the stone quarries in Faridabaad district 
Around 135 bonded labourers were released 
They went back to the madhya pradesh now hear a correspondent,
he or his dependents have to work often with
Who was working in statesman newspaper, wrote a letter to the judge 
Who decided the earlier case on bonded labor,
mentioning that there was no rehabilitation,
even after six months after they release 
The corresponded, in particular said, without land, without work,
without state governments assistance, these released bonded labourers,
was starving, and it the petition  In fact, the letter brought
do the attention of the Supreme Court to the pathetic plight of these
released bonded labourers who were to be rehabilitated 
In response, the Supreme Court gave a series of directions 
less than minimum wages or often no wages and these are done 
It said the rehabilitation must flow quickly follow immediately
after the identification and release of bonded labourers 
The court said, if it is not done 
The release bonded labourers can lapse back into slavery, bonded labour 
The court also said grassroot social action groups,
must be closely involved by the State Administration,
by the district administration in the identification and release of bonded labourers 
And the court ordered, intensive survey of areas
traditionally prone to debt bondage by the vigilance committees,
working in close tandem with the grassroot social groups 
Often in conditions like the person who is under
And the court also asked the state governments to constitute
vigilance committees at the district level, and that the sub divisional level
and reorganize them, activate them and have
meetings of these vigilance committees held at regular intervals
for the purposes of identification, release and rehabilitation of
bonded laborers in the series of orders  There was yet another
landmark order passed by the Supreme Court of India 
In the case of people's Union for civil liberties,
and the state of Tamil Nadu and others  In this particular case,
the Supreme Court asked the National Human Rights Commission of India
the bonded labour system has no freedom of movement,
to get actively involved in monitoring
the progress of implementation of the bonded labour system abolishing act
as well as the various policies for the elimination of bonded labour
and also the follow up action 
After the Supreme Court directions on the issue of bonded labour 
The Supreme Court asked the state governments to submit
affidavits once in every six months,
giving details of the steps that they have taken in format provided by the NHRC
and the court also asked them to take
proper rehabilitation measures
and has no dignity of work or dignity of labour 
to rehabilitate the release to bonded labourers 
And the court said the rehabilitation should be
land based or non land based  It could be art skill,
or a craft based rehabilitation 
The court also asked the government to sensitize officials at various levels 
, let us take up People Union for Democratic Rights
versus Union of India case  This case is known as a Asiad workers case 
In 1982 Asia games were held in Delhi 
Ahead of these games, the Delhi administration engaged
over one lakh contract labourers, through the contractors,
He or she cannot change the occupation 
Dear students, welcome to MOOC on Human Rights In India 
and they were held in such conditions 
They will make to work in such conditions 
which did not follow the labour laws 
And these were brought to the attention
of the Supreme Court by a journalist 
And in response, the court gave a number of important directions 
As I said, people's Union for democratic rights
is a non governmental organization based on Journalists
report in the mainstream magazine 
The people's Union for democratic right,
, in some substance, it amounts to
sent a letter to the Supreme Court, drawing its attention to the
violation of the labor laws, drawing its attention to the various
human rights violations in the Asiad workers case 
In response, the Supreme Court held as follows 
The court said, We are therefore of the view that
when a person provides labour of service to another for remuneration,
which is less than the minimum wage, the labour of service provided by him
clearly falls within the scope and ambit of the words
"forced labour" under Article 23 of the Constitution of India 
, this Judgment, when you read it along with the judgment
a serious violation of the individual's human rights 
in the case of bandhua mukti morcha versus Union of India and others of 1984
We can infer that, a, where a person gets a remuneration,
which is less than the current notified minimum wage 
Under the minimum wages act 1984 
For the particular scheduled employment 
The labour or service provided by that person clearly falls
within the ambit of the term forced labour under Article 23
of the Constitution and where a labourer is made to provide forced labour 
He is presumed to be a bonded labour in terms of the bonded
labour system abolishan act 1976 
If you look at the domestic legal provisions 
In conclusion, we have seen that a number of cases in which the Supreme Court
came to the rescue of bonded labourers in response to letters or
petitions sent by public spirited citizens ordered
release of a large number of bonded labourers working in stone quarries,
Ordered rehabilitation of these bonded labourers
and also gave a number of other important directions,
including payment of compensation 
And a   asked the states to be vigilant 
In fact fashioned a number of creative reliefs 
It has shifted the warmness of the burden of proof
The Constitution of India clearly prohibits beggar and forced labour under Article 23 
to the employer to prove that a person
who complained is not a bonded labourer 
Music
In particular, Article 23(1) prohibits beggar
and forced labor  It also criminalizes its practice in any form 
The fundamental right, which is contained in Article 23(1)
is further complemented with several articles under the
part four, dealing with the Directive Principles of state policy 
For instance, Article 39(A)talks about> right to
In the week five, module two, we take up public interest litigation
adequate means of livelihood for both men and women 
Article 42 talks about just and humane conditions of work and also maternity relief 
Article 43 of the Directive Principles of state policy
talks about payment of a living wage  And these constitutional
provisions have been further complemented with the
adoption of Bonded Labour System (Abolition) act in the year 1976
and also Inter State Migrant Workmen act of 1979 
, let us look at some of the provisions of the
Bonded Labor System (abolition) act 1976  The movement this act was adopted
in 1976 it extinguished all the debt that has been taken by the
relating to bonded labour  Before we go further,
bonded labour and this act is a very stringent act 
It provides for a summary, trial by a executive magistrate 
There are several salient features of the Act 
Which will take up one by one 
One on commencement of this Act, the bonded labour systems
stood abolished, and every bonded labourer
stood freed and discharged free from any obligation
to render bonded labour  Number two, any custom agreement
or other instrument by virtue of which a person was required to render
any service as bonded labour was rendered void 
we need to understand what is meant by bonded labour 
Liability to pay repaid bonded debt was deemed to have been extinguished 
Number three, property of the bonded labourer was freed from mortgage etc 
Number four, forced labourer was not to be evicted from home states
or other residential premises,
which he was occupying as part of consideration for the bonded labour 
Number five district magistrates have been interested with certain duties
and responsibilities for implementing the provisions of this act 
Number six vigilance committees are required to be constituted
at district and sub divisional levels 
Number seven offenses for contravention of provisions of the bonded labour
And in this module, we will see the domestic legal provisions
abolition act or punishable with imprisonment for a term,
which may extend to three years and also with fine 
Number eight purpose of Judicial Magistrate or required to be conferred on
executive magistrates for trial offenses 
Under this act, offenses under this act could be tried summarily 
Every offence under the Act is cognizable and bailable 
In section two of the bonded labour system abolition Act,
Music
The term bonded Labor has been defined  Bonded labour talk refers to a
person who has taken either a loan or a debt or advance
relating to bonded labour, as well as the international
and in lieu of which he or members of his family often work with
low wages or no wages for a specified or unspecified period 
And the system also prevents the person from
changing his job or restricts his freedom of movement 
Music
This is substances the definition of the bonded labour
as given in the bonded labour system abolishing act 
, let us turn our attention to the international legal provisions
relating to the bonded labour, International Labor Organization ILO
adopted a convention on forced labor(29) In the year 1954 
legal provisions on the bonded labour  We will also see
India is a signatory to the ILO convention on forced labour 
And in fact, this convention requires
all member states to move quickly and take steps to eliminate forced labour 
In addition, Article four of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948
prohibits slavery and servitude 
It requires all countries to eliminate it in all forms 
The UDHR or the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provision
finds its echo in the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights that was adopted in the year 1966 
India has also signed ICCPR 
what kind of interventions have been made by the higher judiciary
In addition, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966
Music
refers to the right to work and just and humane conditions of work 
India is a signatory to all these conventions and has
undertaken legal obligations flowing from these
international human rights standards relating to forced labour
or bonded labour  Students,let us now turn our attention to
the Supreme Court's directions in a number of cases involving wanted labour 
First, let us pick up a case filed by Bandhua Mmukti Morcha
headed by Swami Agnivesh he wrote a letter Bandhua mukti morcha as you know,
on the issue of bonded labour, and in the process,
judgment, it was in very important judgment,
and in which the Madras High Court
clarified a number of aspects  The courts specifically
drew a distinction between Human Rights Commission on the one hand
and the Human Rights Court on the other 
It also said the production of Human Rights Act provides
sufficient guidance on what are human rights offenses 
If we look at the definition of human rights
under section 2(D)  It says these are rights
relating to life, liberty equality and dignity
governing the Human Rights courts  And we will also see
Music
as mentioned in the Constitution of India 
Or in the international conventions, and the international conventions
have been further defined as the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
and the International Covenant on Economic social cultural rights
Music
Or such other International Covenant that has been adopted by the
UN General Assembly, and which may be specified by the
Government of India through gazette notification 
what are the practical difficulties which hamper
And , whenever there is a
In fact, the Human Rights courts can always draw
and interpret any human rights matter in the light of these
provisions in order to understand  Whether a human rights offense
has been committed or not  In fact,there have been several other
public interest litigations which had been going on in other courts 
Trying to seek greater clarity on this matter 
For instance, a public interest litigation was filed in Mumbai High Court
Specifically with the directions to set up
or designate human rights courts in every district in Maharashtra
or hinder the effective functioning of these courts
and also appoint special public prosecutors in these human rights courts
and also give training and other address, other aspects 
, this PILS is still going on 
The Supreme Court of India itself,
in a number of cases, has drawn attention of different State governments 
On the need to establish these courts 
In fact, in 2015, the Supreme Court pointed out 
The provision in the production of Human Rights Act 
Which required all states to establish human rights courts
and asked them to take appropriate action to establish them 
and the efforts made by the National Human Rights Commission and the courts
Music
There was a case where the National Commission for protection of
child rights moved against the West Bengal government 
It was about the protection of child rights 
And the here there was an order from the Kolkata High Court
stating the intervention of the National Commission for production of child rights 
, this matter came to the Supreme Court
and the Supreme Court while staying the operation of the
Kolkata high court order underline emphasis The need to establish
human rights courts in all states  Again, there was a law student,
for legal reform or for institutional reform in this direction 
who was deeply moved by the custodial violence
was deeply moved by the increasing number of deaths in police custody
and judicial custody over the years 
As have been documented by the National Human Rights Commission,
in its annual reports  This student moved the Supreme Court of India
and the court again, while handling this
While emphasizing the need to address starcher asked,
and in fact, it completed all the 29 states of the Union of India
and in July 2019, the Supreme Court
again emphasis the need for all
Human_rights_in_india_6913
states to designate a Human Rights Code in different districts,
, we see that though the Protection of
Human Rights Act talked about the
establishment of a national commission or an NHRC at the national level
and SHRC,state's human rights Commission's at the state level,
human rights courts in different districts of the country 
There are legal infirmities lacuna,
in the legislation regarding the what kind of offenses can be
tried under this Human Rights Court, and about the procedure
to be adopted by these court 
If you look at the Protection of Human Rights Act 
These have hampered the effective functioning of the human right courts 
, now With the Supreme Court taking up this matter 
One can hope that in the years to come, there will be
greater clarity on this subject 
And all the states will take appropriate action to designate 
A court of session in every district as a human rights court 
Thank you 
See you in the next module 
Music
In the chapter six, there are two sections 
Which deal with the Human Rights courts 
Before we go into the Human Rights course  Let us see the preamble of the
Dear Students, Welcome to the MOOC on Human Rights In India 
Protection of Human Rights Act  It talks about setting up of a
national commission at the national level 
State Human Rights Commission in states and human Rates quotes,
far better protection of human rights  , we see these levels,
there is NHRC at the national level, and then state Human Rights Commission
in various states and human rights courts in the districts 
And, as you know, it's very important to have a decentralized
redressal missionary for violation of human rights 
In the this such machinery should be closer to home,
and it should enable an individual whose rights are violated,
Today we take up the module on human rights courts 
to take recourse to the remedy provided under the
protection of human rights act and seek relief 
, what does chapter six of the Protection of Human Rights Act say 
Section 30, under Chapter six of the Protection of Human Rights Act says 
Every state government with do consultation of the
Chief Justice of the concern high court may specify, may designate 
A court of session in every district as a human rights court
to try certain human rights offenses 
This is a very interesting provision in itself 
And section 31 of the Protection of Human Rights Act 
As we have already seen, the higher judiciary has a role
Further says that the concerned state shall also appoint public prosecutors 
or designate any advocate with at least seven years experience or more
to function as a special prosecutor,
to function as a public prosecutor to assess the Human Rights courts 
Pursuant to the enactment of the production of Human Rights Act 
A number of state governments have established human rights codes 
They have designated a court of session
in different districts as a human rights codes 
These include Andhra Pradesh, Assam,
Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh 
as the custodian of fundamental rights under the Constitution of India 
But there are some legal infirmities are lacuna in the parent act 
Which really affected or really hampered the effective functioning of these courts,
For instance,the Human Rights courts or for training, human rights offenses 
But the Protection of Human Rights Act does not define 
What are these human rights offenses 
It also Doesn't clearly describe the procedure,
Which can be adopted by these human rights courts
for handling these cases of human rights offenses 
Music
, who will take cognizance of these violations?
We have already seen the public interest litigation 
is an again another important question 
And what are the timelines for
disposal of these cases of human rights offenses 
, these are the matters which have been
left silent in the protection of Human Rights Act 
As a result there has been, what you can say,
lack of clarity ambiguity  And ,all of this
led to the situation that though,
some states have designated court of sessions
in many districts as a human Rates courts it 
In this module, we will see another dimension of the role of
In practice, they proved ineffective  They proved dormant 
And they proved inaccessible  In the light of all this 
Music
There had been several attempts at Law Reform, at legal reform
to overcome these practical difficulties in the way of
the effective functioning of the human rights courts 
For instance, the NHRC itself looked at its own founding statute,
and made a number of recommendations
to the Government of India for amending that act 
And these amendments suggested also include
judiciary with regard to the protection of human rights
Music
amendments to the provisions relating to the human rights courts,
and these have been suggested based on a
high level committee headed by Justice Ahmadi 
, the Protection of Human Rights Act was amended in the year 2006
and again in 2019  But the government really did not amend the
section relating to the human rights codes 
In addition, there was a petition,which came before the Madras High Court 
It was a criminal revision petition 
And the people's Union for civil liberties,
in the form of human rights courts  What are the learning objectives
also moved the Madras High Court regarding
this ambiguity surrounding the Human Rights courts 
Music
the Madras High Court, in fact,
took it with the utmost seriousness, and asked
the response of the National Human Rights Commission 
In fact, about 25 questions were framed
on various aspects of the function The Human Rights courts 
These include the sweep, the scope, the amplitude, the jurisdiction
of this , human rights courts  And it was a very interesting
for this module  We will see the relevant legal provisions
Article 46 which tries to take care of the
educational and economic interests of tribals
Music
is a very important article
and the state is required to keep it constantly in view 
While preparing legislations 
, let us come to the background
to the setting up of the National Commission for shedule tribes 
Soon after the constitution came into being a special officer
was created by the government
National Commission for schedule tribes 
Music
to review the safeguards provided in the
constitution and other laws for tribals 
And that's how
Music
the commissioner for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was created 
Subsequently

in need was felt,
Music
, first let us take up Who are these people called tribals 
for moving from a single member body to a
multi member national level 
Advisory body, and that's how, in the year 1987,
the national level advisory body was created 
Music
Subsequently,
Music
through a constitutional amendment
Music
in 1992, the National Commission for schedule caste
Music
and sheduled tribes was created, and in the year 2004 
Music
Again to another constitutional amendment, these two have been separated
into a separate National Commission dealing exclusively with
shedule cast and the separate National Commission
exclusively dealing with scheduled tribes 
, let us turn our attention to the functions of the
National Commission for shedule tribes 
Music
I invite your attention to the following graphic

Further, under class nine of Article 338(a),
Which is intertwined with their
the Union Government and every state government is required to
consult the National Commission for schedule tribe
on all major policy matters affecting ST 
Dear students, We have already seen
the functions that have been entrusted
to the National Commission for sheduled tribes 
Under the Constitution of India 
Under the orders of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs 
,
Music
Music
it also has been given certain powers
in order to discharge the functions given to it,
particularly in relation to complaints while handling 
Let's say violation of rights, etc 
The National Commission for schedule tribes
has the powers of a civil court trying a civil suit 
It can ask for any report, it can summon people 
It can record evidence on affidavits
and do a number of things in order to redress the
complaints that have been sent to it 
habitat intertwined with their
The Commission cannot entertain
complaints which are sub judice in any other legal forum or complaint 
Which have already been decided by a court of law 
While dealing with
Music
individual complaints of human rights violations faced by
persons belonging to scheduled tribes 
The National Commission for ST basically checks whether FIR's have been properly
filed and all the accused persons have been named or not 
Whether investigation has been properly conducted by the
ecosystem attached to their land  They're attached to their
police officers concerned particularly the prevention of atrocities Act
requires that some senior police officers shall going to
or shall investigate these violations faced by the tribals
Music
and whether special Public Prosecutors have been appointed
and whether these cases are being dealt with by special courts 
As required under the prevention of atrocities act,
and whether medical assistance has been given to victims,
whether compensation has been paid to the victims 
This in some talks about the individual complaints mechanism
traditional ways of culture, religion, and
under the National Commission for shedule tribes 
, let us look at the organizational structure of this commission 
It has its headquarters in New Delhi 
There's a number of regional offices in different parts of the country 
Which act as a bridge between the National Commission at Delhi and the states 
And basically, these regional offices
act as the eyes and ears of the National Commission 
And the work of the National Commission is divided into several departments or wings 
There is one the one hand administration
and establishment wing and there is a economic and social development wing
as a result of the disconnect
and there is a service safeguards and coordination wing
And fourthly, there is an atrocities swing 
First let us look at the atrocities wing 
We are all aware of the scheduled caste Scheduled Tribes
Music
Atrocities Prevention Act of 1986 rules have been framed under these atrocities act 
Which have been recently modified the National Commission
Music
is required to take up individual complaints
in relation to the atrocities faced by tribals
with the rest of the population that been facing
Music
and take them up with the concerned police officers
and also monitor whether proper
redressal has been done or not the under this atrocities wing 
The National Commission also checks
Music
complaints relating to
Music
bonded labour abolishan act faced by persons belonging to tribal communities
or non implementation of the minimum wages act 
social backwardness that had been facing certain other issues 
, let us turn our attention to the service safeguards and
coordination wing 
Music
As you are aware of the Constitution of India,
as provided for affirmative action by the state,
there is a reservation policy
and when tribals have complaints relation to the
implementation of the reservation policy, these complaints are taken up
by this under the service safeguard and coordination wing
at all related to complaints relating to
Music
implementation of reservation are handled there 
The economic and social development wing
Music
looks at the implementation of the tribal sub plan
by the ministries of the Government of India
or the ministries concerned in the States 
And whether these things are being properly implemented or not 
Asked for reports through questionnaires
and also conducts detailed reviews,
with these authorities to see that
and in fact, when our country became independent
Over a course of this module and the coming module,
the developmental plans reach tribals 
This wing is also responsible for
various land reform acts and also the
making recommendations for educational development of tribals 
The admin and establishment wing as its name suggests,
handles all issues relating to the staffing, budgetary
issues of the National Commission for sheduled tribes 
In conclusion, we have seen the definition of tribals 
We have seen the Human Rights challenges faced by the tribals 
You have see in the background to the establishment
and after the adoption of the Constitution of India 
of the National Commission for Scheduled tribes 
We have also seen the complaints mechanism 
We've also seen the working or organizational structure of the
National Commission for scheduled tribes 
Music
We will see the issues relating to tribal
in further detail in the coming module 
Thank you 
Music
In fact you look at article 341 and 342
certain communities have been designated as tribals
and requiring further support by the state 
Music
What are their human rights issues? As we discussed,they had been
Music
Leading a

secluded life away from the rest of the society
we will take up the National Commission for schedule tribes 
and because of the geographical disconnect,
because of the poor infrastructure
Music
they had been facing social and economic backwardness
Music
and if you look at the the literacy levels of tribals in particular
there woman, there is a big gap between
general population on the one hand and the Scheduled Tribes
on the other hand, same is the case with the enjoyment of the Right to Health 
And they had been practicing some primitive agricultural practices
Before we go further, let me outline the learning objectives for this module 
like you know, cut and burns, or slash and burn or June cultivation 
All of these had been contributed
Music
to a series of violations

﻿Hello everyone, welcome back to the session  So,  in this session we will learn about the texturing,  
that is a smart to leave the ultimate  adjustment or the final adjustment for  
later on we can easily adjust the lighting and  the color adjustment in compositing pipeline   
Before we start to explore all the techniques and  the theory that are involved into the process of  
texturing it is essential to see the world around  you so as you allow you to understand specifically  
what you required to create within the computer  generated or the cg environment for your scene 
A truly essential tool for just about any texturing  artist is to make a grid reference library once  
you stumble upon a great picture of any type of  <?>cysteines</?> or the <?>sapheseria</?>   
Scan it, capture it into your personal hard  disk and stack it for upcoming reference  
for the further requirement  This can help you  enormously as you must never function without some  
basic notion of what you are likely to create, to  become a texture artist you should be observe and  
shading, texturing types and how we can  assign the texture and the shading upon  
go through the world in this way and make a habit  of noticing all the tiny information in everything  
and how they are alter, how you <?>perceive</?>  the real surface  These are the facts you need  
to create to make interesting and the  believable texture and it will really  
help you to become a good texture artist  So, now we are learning the difference between  
the shading and the texturing  So, shading,  shading must be the crucial stage of the procedure  
whereby we start to create our lighting  and begin assigning basic ideas to each one  
of the model surface area parameter, for example  color, diffuse, specular, reflection, etcetera   
To ensure that it reacts to light properly,  shading may be the trickiest portion of the  
process generally but determining the  right value for every of your surface  
attribute could be the painful process for a  small tricking looking forward the render    
any model  Hope you have enjoyed the  modeling and now you are able to create  
So, whenever you are putting a tiny details  in any shading, definitely you should give  
a lots of time, you should understand real time  features, what shade are required for example if  
you have to make a glass shader definitely you  should understand about the refractive index  
how the glass would be reflect and what  transparency required in that particular glass   
Now, we move onto the texturing or the surfacing  process, after shading the texturing required now  
it is actually the procedure where we  in fact create average percent texture  
for our surface where either using we are  pictures or we can use the procedural texture   
We will discuss about the Bitmap picture or the  procedural texture in upcoming sessions    
The level of addition detail required depends upon  the surface at hand while the shading meet the  
surface reacts properly to the light, the texture  we create simply use those same shading value  
any kind of prop model in detail  in Autodesk Maya application   
as the best to include details onto top to create  even more realistic feature into your texture   
So, as we discussed, as we said there are  some fundamental difference between procedural  
texturing and the Bitmap texturing  So, what is procedural texture?  
Procedural technique are the code algorithm or  the segment that specify some character text of  
a computer generated model or effect for instance  a procedural texture for a marble surface or for a  
granite surface area does not make use of a scan  in picture to define the color values  Rather it  
is a use of algorithm and the mathematical feature  to look into the color, one of the most crucial  
tough feature of procedural method is abstraction   In procedural strategy in a stage of explicitly  
specifying a strong all detail into the  picture or sequence, pack them right in to  
the function or on algorithm and evaluate  that process when and where required   
So, after completing the modeling, it’s a  time to start texturing and the shading   
Procedural techniques permit the  inclusion in style of any preferred  
quality of physical precision  There are  several advantage of procedural texture,  
so the procedural texture over an image texture  as follows, first a procedural texture or the  
representation is incredibly compact, the size  of procedural texture is normally measured  
in kilo byte, while the size of texture image  is normally measured into the megabyte or mb   
This is also true for a solid texture since the  three D texture images are really large, none the  
less some individuals have utilized tomographic  graphic x-ray scanner to acquired digitized  
volume picture to make use as a solid texture  There are some advantage of procedural texture,  
first is the procedural representation does  not have any fix resolution  Generally,  
it could provide a complete detail texture  regardless of how carefully you consider it   
The procedure of applying the texture and the  color to an object to create a <?>drendrable/?>  
A procedural representation, address no fixed  region, quite simply it is really unlimited in  
degree and make over an attributory large region  without seems and without undesired repetition  
on the texture pattern  A procedural texture  could be parameterized so it can generate a  
class of related texture instead of being  limited to one big fix texture images   
There are few disadvantage of procedural texture  also  The disadvantage of procedural texture  
as compared to an image texture or the Bitmap  texture as follows, a procedural texture could  
be challenging to build and debug, programming  is hard often and development and implicit design  
explanation is hard to non-trivial situation  especially  A procedural texture could be a shock   
It is simpler to predict the result when  you scan or color a texture image   
Some social people decide to like this property  to procedural texture and call it <?>6:56</?>,  
is the called texturing process  When an object is created by you in Maya  
some cultural people hate it and state the  procedural texture to hard to regulate  Analyze  
the procedural texture could be slower than  accessing the keep picture based texture or bitmap  
based texture  This is actually the classical  period versus space spread off  Aliasing could be  
an issue in procedural texture also, antialiasing  could be a difficult and the short anali,  
less inclined to be studies care immediately  than it really in image based texturing   
What is bump mapping? Probably the most used  surface property along with color bump mapping  
is a way whereby we can create the illusion of  irregularity or the damage, for example scrapes,  
dents, and almost any type of textural green  to surface area without increasing or altering  
the geometry of the model at all  Because no  surface now days is perfectly smooth, no matter  
how smooth it could be appear, all areas you  create will require some type of bump mapping  
application for example by default the grey color  should <?>arrange</?> immediately assign to it,  
to be able to create feeling of tangible  texture or roughness to the things 
Clever use bump mapping conveys the viewer a concept  for the top would be feel like to be touch   
Bump mapping versus displacement mapping, just  a little <?>step</?> for improving your bump map  
is to make sure that your surface has at least  small amount of specularity  Incase if you having  
problems with viewing bump map or just wish to  improve the after effect of your bump map try  
upping your specular amount and this may greatly  enhance your bump map effect  Okay, so we have  
discussed the actual fact the bump mapping should  not be used to <?>pay too</?> little geometry   
Well perhaps you have ever <?>9:00</?> that there  is a method to create geometry utilizing bump map   
There exists a way to achieve that and the  technique is called the displacement map but  
displacement map is totally depend upon the number  of the vertices or the polygon  Whenever you have  
which will let you start to see the object, fill  new light and the render the picture or the scene   
to generate a high detail displacement in your  model you should add a lot of vertices to that   
Displacement map basically require a texture  and deform that geometry of an object  
based on the texture used  Since, displacement map is not actually  
a texturing issue, it will not go deeply right  into the discussion onto it to as a possible read  
about the practical program in maya application  how we can achieve the displacement map, how what  
could be the difference between displacement and  the bump map in our practical session in Maya   
However, a thing that we do have consider it  normally when to make use a simply bump map  
texturing, so when to make use displacement  that tricky matter with displacement  
and normally that get actually great displacing   So, you must have high polygons count on your  
model extremely which can increase rendering  period automatically  Now, let’s move to the  
Either texture might appearance different  after the animating enlighting the scene  
﻿Hello everyone, welcome back to the session, so  in this session we will learn about the Maya shader  
Along the way you can zoom it out the  hypershade window to get the complete picture   
You can also view in the shading  network in the hyper graph window  
but this view does not give you the <?>1:12</?>  images  Types of shader, there are majorly  
five types of shaders we use into the  Maya application  Lambert, Phong, Phong E,   
Blinn, Ramp shade up  There are two more shader  usually sometime we use in Maya application,  
first is the background shaders and second  is the layer shader  Now  one on one we will  
discuss about each and every shaders where  and when we have to use these shaders    
So, we will start with Lambert, this material  type or this shader type is the most basic  
and it doesn’t include any property of  specularity  This make it perfect for matte  
surface that do not reflect the surrounding  environment, the Lambert shader type can be  
and photorealistic shader in Maya application,  how we can generate the photorealistic output  
transparent and will refra-active <?>1:59</?>  rendering also but without a specularity   
Wood, glass this could be the some example of  the Lambert shader or the Lambert material    
Phong shader, usually we use Phong shader to add  sharp specular highlight to the Lambert material   
The size and the intensity of highlights are  controlled by the cosine power attribute or the  
property  This shader can also have reflection  from either environment map or the <?>2:30</?>  
reflection  The Phong material is really very good  for plastics, so any kind of plastic material,  
plastic object we have to create in 3D application  we can assign the Phong shader into it    
Phong E shader- phong E shader types add  a different type of specular highlight  
to the Lambert  The Phong E shader includes  attribute or the property such as roughness  
that control the softness of the highlight,  whiteness that color intensity, highlight size  
in Maya software with the help of some of the  Maya <?>0:17</?> shader or the Arnold shader   
we can increase with the help of the parameter   We can use the Phong E shader for glass,  
we can use the Phong E shader for making  any kind of highly reflective surface    
After Phong E shader we have one more shader  here, usually we prefer this shader for making  
any kind of shiny objects, Blinn material or the  Blinn shader, many artist use this material type  
exclusively because it offer high quality of  specular highlight using the attribute such as  
eccentricity or the specular roll off  This material type can be edited to  
look like a Phong editor also which has a  <?>sharper</?> highlight in case where you need  
better antialiasing of highlights during an  animation this material would be really very  
good material or the shader  We can use Blinn  material for the metallic surface also    
Ramp shader- this shader give you  the extra control over the way  
So, before you start the shading we  should know about the hypershade window   
color changes with light and the view angle  you can stimulate a variety of exotic material  
and <?>twick traditional</?>  shading in <?>subtle way</?>   
All the color related attributive Ramp  shader are controlled by Ramps only   
After Ramp we have another shader called the  Layer shader- so a Layer shader allow you to  
combine two or more material or the multiple  material that each have their own quality,  
own property, each material can be designed  separately then it connected with the Layer shader  
the top layer transparency can be adjusted  or map to reveal part of the layer below   
Layer shader render more slowly than other  material instead using the Layer shader  
it may better to set up regular material,  node that use or Layer texture node map to  
the color  Specular and diffuse map can create  the appearance of variation in this material  
Shading network are behold as note that  control specific aspect of shading effect   
quality of the surface  At end of the shader  we have one more shader here called the use  
background shader- usually we use background  shader in <?>compositing</?> pipeline   
The use Background shader is primary meant for  the combining <?>easy</?> and the live action  
component  This material assign to a stand in  geometry that represents surface and the object  
in the live action field  This material then cast  shadow and the reflection from the object into the  
scene, many of the diagrams in this session or in  these sections would be render with the help of  
Background shader in upcoming classes  In  compositing classes, we can use the Background  
shader also to compose it to add 3D model into  the live footage also  Now, let’s moves to the  
The network define how various color and  texture node work with associated light and surface   
The placement of the texture on surface  is also control by the node within the network   
There are several way of viewing shading network  in Maya, the hypershade window let you easily  
connect node and view the connected attribute   You can also double click on any node to open  
the attribute editor, accordingly you can change  or the modify the parameter of the shader   
﻿Hello everyone, after completion of texturing  fundamental now it’s a time to get some assignment  
that’s the pass rendering system works  Right now we are using the layer shaders,  
so you can just have the panels like render  pass mode, you can have the render pass mode  
if you are working in different texture  but right now I am just having this parts  
to just and you can see it’s all get faded,  if you select it then the wireframe will show,  
if you have the render view, you will found  that its only just like a mask okay   
So, it depends on its color features, if you have  the color features like transparency definitely  
transparency gonna work  As you can see  now it’s getting transparent and just  
attracting all the things which  is just overlapping the same   
So, we will select this one right click assign  new material and go to Maya and here we have the  
Phong, so there are two different which is the  Phong and the Phong E  Definitely Phong E and  
and after that you can have shift D for repeating  the result okay  So, I have taken five I will  
Phong are similar to each other but one more thing  by default its lustre, shininess, glossiness value  
is higher as compared to this one okay  Both of them you can use in any of the metals or  
even to the plastic, right, hard surface okay   So, Phong and as you can see it has more shine  
shininess because its producing by default light  which is present inside Maya  We haven’t use any,  
any lighting inside the Maya right now, though I  going to Phong and just have all the panels which  
is same, exactly same, so matte opacity just  abstract the outer surface of your model   
So, I will just off this for a while, you have  the reytrace option also  So, when you are making  
any model and just putting any texture inside it,  if you want to just pass any light from inside it  
and just bounce into the ground or nearby object  you have to check the render option refractions  
select all of them and move to the center okay  We will select all of them again and go to edit  
and after that with a simple amount of tweaking  you can have a good result for light bounciness  
on ground  Hope you understand the  same, let’s meet to the next session 
and here you have the delete by type history  so I will its history because history I don’t  
required so I will go to attribute editor and  now you can see only three things are there okay,  
so no problem one more thing we have to group  the model so if you can select and control G I  
have already did it earlier, so grouping is very  important okay, now what I will do, I will just  
go to the render settings so make sure that your  render using should be in Maya software okay   
We will focus in Arnold renderer later wards but  at first we have to understand the concept of Maya  
software texturing and also its lighting, so I  have gone to the Maya software and here you have  
a couples of different things like common and  Maya software panels, after that I will close this     
of shaders onto the model  So, for shading we  should use the hypershade option into the Maya  
And If I select any of them and if you press  right mouse button by holding right mouse button  
we will find three things which is assign new  material, assign favorite and assign existing   
So, this is will just allow you to overlap a new  material and will replace the previous material  
so you can use this assigning material or if  you have any material and you have rename the  
same so you can go to the favorite material  and choose that particularly material which  
you have renamed  An existing material which  is already inside your scene so you can just  
put that particular material on your model  So, right now I am using assign new material, so  
at first as you can see we have a huge  amount of panels like Arnold Maya but  
right now I am in Maya software so I used the  Maya software  So, there are few things inside  
the Maya software like this one and this  all came in for the mental ray panel    
application, so in shading chapter we will discuss  about the working with photorealistic shading as  
So, like this way Arnold and mental ray basically  are third party plugin okay, so I will just  
select this and just go to this surface  So, in  this surface there are these materials which is  
present inside it  One of the most common  material is the Lambert which is by default  
material is present inside Maya software  If you select or click or make any model,  
then by default material is the Lambert if I go  to attribute editor you will find that the by  
default material is the Lambert one, will delete  the same, will select it go to the material editor  
which I have minimized and will go to the  Maya  These are the main materials which you  
can found in any version of Maya okay  So, at  first this is the Blinn if you click over here  
okay  Now, as you can see it has some  short of shininess in it  If you press  
six it will show the texturing result   But, there is no any light in the scene,  
well as we will discuss about the several type of  textures for example anisotropic, Blinn Lambert,  
so if I press seven all the things will be dark   So, no problem we will discuss the lighting thing  
in the lighting session, right now I am focusing  on the texturing  So, we have just used the Blinn,  
so Blinn have some sort of shininess if I  go to its property feature which is just  
right side on your screen inside  the attribute editor, so I will go  
to the Blinn and here you have the color,  transparent, Ambient, Incandescence, Bump  
which is all present here diffuse,  translucence, translucence depth okay   
That means each and everything is given over  here, so if you see this if I render the same  
we found that some sort of shininess is there  So,  with the help of the color you can definitely you  
can change the color and with the help of the  transparency you can transparent the same,  
so now it will behave like a glass, see,  okay  After that the ambient color, we’ll just  
Phong, Phong E and etcetera  where we have to use  and how there should be some difference between  
if you increase the ambient color what happens  have a look, it will just glow much more   
Incandescence value, it will produce some  lightning effect  As you can the nearby  
object will be affected if you just increase  the value of incandescence to any them   
So, I will put this by default value which is  this one and you change your color definitely  
okay, I will just put somehow red and now if  I go down I have the bump mapping so these are  
the important features if you are working in the  texture you have to undergo through this process  
okay  So, there is a huge amount of panel  you don’t have to go each and every time,  
so that means these are one of  the most important thing   
If you are uncomfortable with this scrolling up  and down because you don’t have enough space for  
that you have to just click over the copy tap  now it will just have a particular window which  
is the duplicate of this part  So, you can put  it somehow here and you can just drag easily   
So, you have the more space to look at your  texturing properties as you have seen which  
is the bump map  If I just zoom this, if  I just render the same data using this  
one you will found the surface is the smooth  definitely yes, the surface is the smooth   
And if you increase or just  put some texture in the bump  
so it basically depends on the texturing  If,  for example, if I select the wood what happens?  
If I have selected the wood and after that if  you just drag this, you will found this panel  
which is coming at the right side on your screen  which the panel of the bump, so you have the  
bump depth  You can change the bump value, you  have the bump depth if you increase the depth  
it will affect your model, see  As you can see it is producing some sort of  
Hi everybody, so welcome to this course of  introduction to texturing inside Maya application   
texture but it also have some sort of up and down  shape so it’s only illusion that means bump only  
gives illusion  So, you have some sort of emboss  bevel like structure on you model surface  If you  
decrease the bump depth definitely if it goes  to minus, then it will just insert the same,  
if it goes to plus then it will extend  the same  So, I will just put zero  
and after that I will just  increase little bit okay   
If I just go to the render tap and now you can see  your model is visible, its shapes are visible but  
also the bump texture and the detail as  you can see here we have some sort of gap  
but it’s not gap in your model, its  only in the texture that’s a main reason  
for bump mapping and you can change well  you click over here and you can change,  
you can change the color also definitely yes   But, it will not effect on your model okay   
So, right now I am using Maya two thousand  eighteen, so I have make this model so I will  
So, that’s the main thing of the bump map  So, like this way you can just put the textures  
of the Bump and all okay  So,  now I will focus in this part  
I will just select all of them right click,  assign new material, right now Maya and here  
you have the Lambert  Lambert is the by  default which doesn’t have any any sort of  
shininess and glossiness, it’s a dull like as you  can see there is a difference between both of them  
so this is by default present  inside the Maya software  
and if I just select and just go to its property  features same thing you will found here   
You have the bump map, incandescence,  ambient color, transparency and all  
I will just decrease the value of translucent, you  have translucent focus, special effects if you go  
start the concert of texturing inside this   So, let’s get started as what I will do,  
to you have glow intensity, so it will only happen  when you have a proper lighting on your scene   
So, Lambert is a dull material like a clay  which is present by default in the Maya   
Selecting the other one and just right click,  assign new material Maya and layer shader   
If I go to Layer shader you have few things  which is the color, transparent, composite flag  
and render pass mode  So, it allow you to render  in a particular pass step by step, what is pass  
we will discuss this in pass section  I will say  you that the pass is basically the different type  
of texture which is inside the model and you  have to render one by one, at first you have  
to render the ramp, after that reflection, after  that surface shader, after that ambient occlusion,  
after that Blinn and all  After having render  all those things you have to go the compositing  
software and just compile all the renders in the  single form and just merge and have a good result,  
I will just select the model and just make  some duplicate control D for duplicate  
﻿Hello everyone, after completion of shading  pipeline, now it’s a time to assign some wrap or  
open UV one by one so you can see   So, let’s meet to the next session 
directly with the help of Maya application, with  the help of brush and some wiser option also   
After successful completion of 3D paint,  we move to the render setting because  
whatever we are doing with through the Maya  application, for final conclusion or final output,  
we should have to do some render output  So, for  there are several options into the render view,  
so we will discuss how we can utilize the  render view setting in Maya application  
for better understanding how we can achieve the  best result in Maya software with the help of  
particular proper lighting, proper texturing and  with the help of creation of good model also   
Hi everyone, so in this session I will build a  small and a very easy model and I will use the  
UV unwrapping to texture the same  So, let’s  get started  Now, I will make a box and I will  
increase the size of the box okay  Now, what I  will do in the channel box and the layer editor  
some texture or some bitmap onto the model which  define the things, what kind of object should be  
I will go to down and here we have the  input panel which is polyCube one   
So, I have subdivision width, height and depths,  so I will increase by two okay, no problem    
And after that what I will do right click  and vertex, we’ll select the top vertex  
and just move it down a little bit  This would  be fine  And after that we’ll go to the edge  
or the face, I will select the face that would  be better for me and I will just drag this up  
a little bit okay  This would be fine  As you  can see this is a very basic and dummy model,  
<?>and</?> that’s making all the things going to  the edge and just select both of them and we’ll  
move somehow at the up okay, object mode  As you can see that’s a dummy model because  
at first you have to understand the concept  of UV then you can just work for the same   
So, right now what happens next, I will make a  box by default it’s just forming in the center,  
look like into the feature, that could be a part  of aesthetic development also  Now, it’s a time  
no problem, just decrease the size, increase  all over by and just decrease the thickness,  
increase little bit going to the top and just  manage like, is it fine or not? Let’s have a look,  
as you can see the wireframe is not visible,  so I have to see the wireframes  So, I will  
select both of them, go to shading  and here you have a panel which is  
wireframe on shading, just check the same   As you can see, if you don’t select also the  
wireframe will be shown on your screen  That’s the  benefit of it  So, we’ll just move it somehow here  
okay  Now, what I will do right click, go to  vertex and just select this vertex and just move  
it somehow here because it’s very hectic to manage  from here or to manage from scale  So, I will just  
move it somehow here and we’ll just drag it up   And we’ll just go to the side view, we’ll move it  
here, somehow here and the size is very large  and also we have to just move it somehow  
to get learn about the UV maps  UV map help you  to define 2D coordinate system of your 3D model,  
here, that would be fine  Moving above here and object mode   
For rotation if I rotate it will be very hectic  to rotate like this okay, so what I will do,  
I will just press D, that’s the pivot, it can  adjust the pivot here, so I just adjust the pivot  
and just rotate the same, so as I rotate it’s very  large, control z, so going to vertex again, select  
this point and just move it somehow here, object  mode okay, now rotate the same, let’s have a look,  
it working fine or not? Problem we will just shift it somehow here   
And one more thing you have  to do just select this part,  
already the pivot is at here, so just move  it somehow here, move it down and also  
press D again, just align it, somehow here  select this part and we’ll go to the perspective,  
I think we have to just decrease its size, so  vertex select this and just move it somehow here,  
so <?>easily</?> we can paint out 3D model into  2D map form and later on that 2D map we can easily  
right click, object mode, select this part  
and go to edit and here you have  duplicate special, click over here   
So, right now I am not using instance because if  you click on instance whatever you do changes it  
will automatic update in the opposite side, so I’m  not using the instance, instead of having instance  
I will go for copy  So, I will just go to edit and  just reset the same and as you can see the z value  
is one, so as you can have the look, if you select  the model it has three axis  The blue is facing to  
the z, so I need in this direction, what I will  do, I will just select this part and in z I will  
just press minus one and apply the same  So, right now it has been applied and  
just manually rotates the same  little bit of it ok, no problem   
So, as you can see it has been done and I have to  define the boundary also  If you need any box to  
assign onto the 3D model for further use  After completion of 2D map, we have some  
be kept at the top you can kept but right now I  will just leave it as it is and we’ll just make  
a box and I have to make the boundary, so I just  making the new box and just put it over here    
One more thing I have to tell that, I will make  only one strip of the boundary and we’ll copy  
the same because I have to apply only one UV  and just copy the same, so it will just repeat,  
that’s the main thing  So, we’ll decrease the  size little bit both of them and we’ll increase  
its height  So, we’ll put it somehow here and  one more thing, right click, go to face and  
just select this face, move it somehow here  If you press shift, you can have the extrude,  
okay  So, by pressing shift you can have extrude,  so I will extrude it little bit like this,  
object mode and I will make a new box  again and just move it somehow here,  
we’ll select both of them and we’ll isolate it,  
<?>projects</?> and techniques also available into  Maya application like planner mapping, cylindrical  
and we’ll isolate here from here also,  and we’ll isolate from here also   
And finally we’ll have to see in the front, so  we’ll isolate the same, and move it somehow here   
And we’ll keep it at between  them, we’ll decrease the size,  
increase its length, width, move it here,  not too much, this would be fine okay    
I’m not attaching it, that’s the basics of  UV so I’m not attaching it, when you will  
have a detail UV classes you can have to attach  and have a complicated model to build the UV,  
that would be fine, okay  But, that’s the basic  for UV and as you can see we have just make this  
<?>scene</?>, you can say if you have some simple  scene also you can isolate that means you will not  
get distracted from here or you cannot  directly or by <?>incidently</?> you can  
mapping, spherical mapping  We will discuss  this all texture projection methodology in Maya  
select any of them because you have to focus  in this part only, so can have the isolation  
that would be very beneficial  As  you can see here, we have very basic  
model of a hut, we don’t have any door, window  and all, we don’t have any fence and all   
So, one more thing I have to do, I  just duplicate the same control D  
and just put it somehow here, as you can see  each and every part is different from each other   
So, that’s the very basics for UV and when you are  studying for that you can have a complicated UV,  
we’ll do in a complicated model okay,  no problem  I'm just put it somehow here  
and select this part, go to face and just select  this one and by pressing R if you select shift  
button and just move it, inside it you can have  to extrude the same and we’ll delete the data   
So, I have a blank space, right now what I  will do, I will go to edge and we’ll select the  
application also  After successful learning on UV  maps, shaders and the fundamental of texturing,  
boundary, if you select any one  of them, just double click it  
and we’ll press W and just move downward little  bit, not so much because it’s basically dummy, so  
right click object mode  So, this is the chimney  part of the house, we’ll out it somehow here,  
it should be small not so high that would  be fine okay  So, we have only one boundary,  
we’ll just copy the same and we have a hut   So, I will just save the file,  
okay no problem  I have saved the file and now  in the next session, what I will do, I will just  
open all the parts and we’ll go to the,  
so you have all the things like UV here and  we’ll just switch to the texturing panel for more  
texturing view  So, we have 3D paint and  also, we have create PSD network  So,  
we’ll look at it and at first we’ll  just focus on the UV part, so we’ll  
now it’s a time to get learn about the 3D painting  tools, where we can easily <?>paint</?> 3D model  
Hello everyone, so in this session I will open the UV of this hut and also this barricade part 
in the z direction, so apply and project 
is the y, apply and project 
Finally, this one which we have already worked, so we have the four parts which we will connect this 
Select this part, just rotate the same, so as you can see if I go to edge and just select
both of them, so as you can have a proper look that both of them can be connected because
if you are select this one, it will automatically highlight into the other part 
So, that’s the wrong way, you have to just select each and every thing, right click go
Go to UV, if you select this and for a time I will maximize it 
If I want to rotate, it’s not rotating in a snap way 
So, what I will do, I will select all of them, we’ll go to tool and
here we have rotation  So, I will click on its window panel and in tool settings you have snap steps, so that
says off, we will on it and in every fifteen step we will snap the same 
Same with this one as it is already being in a right way, so we’ll click at the shell,
Right click, edge, select both of them and we’ll sew it 
So, as you can see, each and every part has opened, we don’t have to require this part
to face, just select by holding shift button one by one 
because already as we have told you that, this will be connected to the other 
So, we’ll go to object mode and isolate the same of all this and all the parts has
been opened 
So, in next session, we will learn how you can add some textures and how it can be implemented
on your model 
So, let’s continue to the next session 
As you have seen this part has been selected and we’ll go to UV and here you have the planar 
So, instant of using this one you should go to have in the window button and after that
when the option came, here you can see its facing towards the z direction, so here is
the projection from z-axis 
If you apply then it will just cause the same, after that you have to hit on the project
and then it will close 
So, I will just move it over here and we’ll select this part by holding button and after
that we’ll go to UV again, here we have the option 
So, as we have discussed that we will just open this UV of that particular part and we’ll
And as you seen that, x is facing this part, so we’ll go to the x and apply project and
we’ll close the same 
We’ll move it somehow here, later wards we’ll just put it inside this corner of
the box, so that all the things will be aligned in a proper way 
We’ll select by holding shift, so I'm in face mode, now we’ll go to UV and here you
have the planar again, so to its property feature, as you can see z is facing this part,
so we’ll go to the z-axis and apply project, we’ll move it here 
This is the front one and this is the back part 
We’ll select all of them, it’s forming the square shape but we required the proper
triangulate and the square both 
just duplicate copy and we’ll surround the hut 
Planar, x direction and apply and project 
As we have said that the triangle and the square has came 
So, this would be the last part which we have opened, this one also and that’s the ground
part, so we don’t require to open it because we don’t have to paint something here, right
click and object mode 
Make sure that whenever you are working in UV or any other file, you should have a save
and also you should make a new version 
After getting save, you will un-isolate it because we have more parts which is at the
top, so I will just select both of them 
So, let’s start, so at first I will just select the part and as you notice that our
At first we’ll just focus this and isolate it 
Go to UV and here you have the cylindrical mapping 
As you can see that this structure is like a box but it’s revolve around it, so what
happens now instead of using planar we should go for cylindrical 
And here you have the panel okay, apply and after applying its forming the half cylinders,
so I will just click over here and just remove this and we’ll touch it to the end point 
As you can see when you open your UV editor, the thing has been unwrapped properly and
after that the top part which is this one, we’ll select one by one, go to UV and have planar 
pivot size is small 
Because that’s only a plane and if you look at your axis which is facing in the y direction,
so y would be fine and apply project 
This thing has been removed 
That’s the last part, so we don’t require to open it and also the inside part, this
one, if you need to open you can but I think if you just paint something here, it will
just match the same 
Let’s have a look, go to object mode, control S, make sure that you are saving your file
and isolate it 
Now, this one, so I will open only one and I will just copy the same here, right click,
face, select this one, so we don’t require to open here but, yes definitely because this
So, I will just press plus sign to increase the pivot size 
part will be visible, so better to open it 
That would be fine, object mode again, select this one and just isolate the same 
If you are opening UV here and if this part is just duplicated over there, we’ll just
replace this one 
Go to face, select this face and UV and here you have the planar 
As it is facing in the z direction, go to apply and have project, now go to UV editor
and just see, it’s forming quite well, we’ll adjust the size later wards 
So, I will just put darker color at the corners but I have to remove this face, so UV and planar 
So, it’s facing in the z direction, apply and project 
So, both of them we have open and object mode again and isolate it 
Now, at first I will select this part and just go to the isolate selection, as you can
Finally, we have this part, which we have just make this, both of them are separate
with each other, that’s a box and that’s you can say the boundary part 
Select this one and after that go to UV, but at first you have to select the faces, otherwise
the front, at the top and the bottom will also be selected 
So, go to face and just select them 
I need only this part, that would be fine and after that go to UV, and cylindrical 
Click over here apply, select the red part and just move it here 
Now, as you can see the cylinder UV has revolved and also go to UV editor and just see its
result, it’s forming quite well 
And now the top and the bottom part 
see all the things has been gone 
As it’s facing in the y direction, so y-axis apply and project 
We’ll remove here, we’ll have to keep the size of a particular side okay, because
as you can see, it’s taking the size of a particular area, so I will just decrease
the size by pressing R and just move somehow here 
When we’ll start working in the checker, we will have to adjust it because each and
every box should be at its original size and nothing work should be <?>displaced</?> like
if you have some box whose size is much more as compared to the other parts, that should be wrong 
So, each and every box should have the same size and we’ll off this for a while 
The downward part we have to remove this, so go to UV and UV editor, at first go to
planar, facing on the y-axis which is already we have taken, apply and project 
We’ll go the UV which is inside the modeling tab and in UV you have the UV editor 
So, one more thing, this part and this part they have different sizes, the top one is
the larger as compared to the bottom one 
That means the top will always been larger and we will kept this top at the top one and
this should be go here 
Finally, we have the box, and isolate the same to have a look at the box 
Select the box and right click face, we don’t require to open this part because each and
every boundary will just connected to here and we will have duplicate copies 
So, we don’t require to open this two part, we will just open the side one and so we’ll
As you can see this part is just open like this way 
﻿Hi everyone, as you have seen that we have  opened UV of this hut including this one    
move it here and here   
Now, next we’ll just do one more thing   
So, I will just select delete and  
now I will save the file  Go to file and  save as, desktop and we’ll go to JPEG,  
okay, Control S and minimize the same   Will go to Maya, and will select this part,  
a lots more of history, so first I will save the  file  I will go to delete by type, history   
So, it will clean up the history  Now, we have  Lambert and click over the color and here we  
I will just go to the image and  you have the UV snapshot    
have the file  Click and her you have the image  name, click and now we’ll choose the texture   
So, here is the texture and will open the same  If I  press six, you can see it is showing over here,  
can fix this in this tutorial only   And,  
so what I will do, I will just select  this from UV and at first, will just  
we will go to create UV shell  Select and  move this here and just increase the size   
Just drag this and just put it somehow  here  Select this and put it somehow here   
I will select this file  and as you can see, we have  
But at first, I will go to UV and select all  the files and go to image and here you have the  
go to the image and here we have the UV snapshot  in image and again will jut browse the same and  
So, we have this file and  will drag this in Photoshop     
Enter, after that, will just delete the top one   Right click, Rasterize layer and now we  
have to just shift all the things  So, what I  will do, I will do one more thing, I will just  
select this part, which is  four and will move somehow here  
Now, as you can see, we have a seam  which is been generated over here    
So I will go to brush, eraser we have the soft  eraser and after that we just erase the seam data   
UV snapshot  So, as you can see, its image  format is Maya IFF, I will change it to  
So, we do not require any seams   This is a seam which is forming here   
Now as you can see, it has formed  quite well and also has proper lining   
window here, the another one somehow here   
And now, we will just open the texture  
in this layer only and put some more here   
This one is fine  We have to figure out if it is  possible to remove all those thing, okay, fine   
PNG  If you have JPEG then the gray background  with the grid will also form  So, i don’t  
So, i will select all by shift selecting   Remove this part which you do not require   
So, it is removing from here  also  We’ll delete this data,  
delete control D  Select this file which is four  
and delete it  Now, we have this panel,  no problem  We’ll select this part,  
put it somehow here, okay   And, as you can see, it is overlapping,  
So, I don’t need this place  Select the data  and delete the data same, control D  After that,  
we’ll just select this part  
and we’ll just delete the same, control D  As you  can see that, there is a part which is forming  
here  And we do one more thing, we just go to  eraser's data from here and after that what we will do we’ll just  
copy the upper part from this portion by holding  alt button and we move it here  We move it here   
require JPEG and I need PNG  And the texture  value is quite good  Increase this little bit  
Select this and just move  Select this  and just move, select this and move   
And 
so, save your file  Of the upper  data, and go to file and save as  
and go to JPEG and save, so  I will replace this, okay   
and UV area is tile okay  Apply and close  Cut this half and right click, object mode  
and will go to Photoshop  So, right now, I  am using CS6 and we’ll paint the texture   
So as you can see, the Photoshop has been  opened and I also have some references and  
also the texture  So, i have this reference  I  will follow this and will have this amount of  
textures for the wooden house  So now, what  I will do, I will just go to photoshop and  
So, right now, what I will do is select this hut  and will go to the UV and here we have the UV editor okay    
at first I will just drag the UV   And now i have just dragged the UV and  
I will just make a new layer and will click  over here and alt backspace and I will just put  
here  So as you can see, we have all the panels,  this one, this one, if you zoom, you can have  
a proper look at your models and at your UV  models  So, if I go here, if I open my UV editor  
and if I go and put it somehow here  for the quick examin purpose only    
Now, as you can see we have this house and  right click go to face, so this would be the  
front part  So, what I will do, I will just go to  the front part  This would be the front part and  
we’ll just import the texture one by one and  now, for that I will just go to any of the, I  
think this would be fine, and go to the Photoshop  and just select, just move it over here okay   
So, as you can see, we have just inverted  the texture and one more thing we have to do   
So now, I will  just select all the files  
And now, what I will do is press t and will  stretch this a little bit and will select this  
and just move it somehow here  So you can see,  seams is generating ok and no worry We’ll just  
sort it out  And both of them I will select  both of them by holding control  Right click,  
Rasterize layer  At first, this is  at the top, so I will just select the  
soft eraser as you can see here the soft eraser  opacity is thirty three percent, no worry    
We’ll just click like this, so I  should have a clean and good texture  
okay  That’s very important  So, you have to paint  the texture like this  So, I will merge the layer  
and will just select this and  just move it somehow here okay   
And after that, we’ll go to eraser  again and just select and just  
by going to UV and will select all of the file  and just scale it down and put it somehow here  
we’ll select both of them, merge  layers  Then move it here, move it here   
As you can see I am overlapping  it, no problem okay  Fine    
So, I will just select all of them, merge  layers and we’ll just move it somehow here  
okay  Now, as you can see, this part needs to  be cut it off, so I will just cut this part   
Delete, control D,  
so that’s the section and what I will do, I will  
go up to here and drag this into  here and just put it somehow here  
And if I delete, it will delete the entire part  But,  I need this part to deleted, both of them 
So, I will just hold control shift and I for inverse  selection and delete the same, Control D    
okay  Now, we have to lay this out, so I  will select this one and just move it here   
As you can see, we have deleted the part and  just put it somehow here  So, if I just off this,  
you will found proper look  So, I am making  the gate and I will just put somehow here  
take a brush and just select this, any of  the crunch brush  So, at first I have to just  
examine the first  So, I will make a new  page so that I will examine my brush   
That would be fine  Like this way you have  to paint  So, always paint in new layer   
If you have to paint, you have to paint  in new layer  So, capacity would be down   
So, randomly I am painting  Okay  And now, as you can see you can just turn  
the opacity to be little bit down and also you can  change the blending work from here  So, you should  
just click the downward arrow, as you can see, you  can change and also just copy, one more control j  
That’s the down part, so we don’t require  it  So, I will just select this    
and go to normal and put it down a little  bit okay, so that you have a grunge kind of look 
So  now, one more thing we have to do   We’ll just go to the opacity hundred and  
make sure that nothing happens into the layer   Select one point and click over here  Click and  
shift click over here  You have a proper line,  click and click like this way and also you have to  
okay  Now, we’ll do same thing  We’ll turn off  
the upper layer and after that We’ll  just decrease the opacity and We’ll just  
select this control j and will go to this part  and just go to normal and will turn down the  
opacity a little bit okay  We have a random kind  of look  And here, we need some window like,  
so what I will do, I will just select any of  the part  I think this would be fine  Or even,  
I think this would be fine, so  we’ll just decrease the size,  
Make sure that your layers should always be at the  bottom  So, we have this top white layer, which is  
the wireframe of the model as you can see here,  this one  So, that should be at zero  After we  
are satisfied with our work, I will just off this  and will render the same data  Now, we have this  
window and also we need to just rasterize the  same  After that, we just select this part  
and do the same what we did  But right now I  will just use alt backspace, control D 
And that is matching because this texturing also  I have taken from here  Just click and just  
select this one and just put it somehow here  and select this one and put it somehow here   
and we’ll just merge the same  Now, it’s complete  and also we have to select this, which is two,  
Move it somehow here   
As if I go, select this part, you can  see this is the part where we have to  
put the texture  I will just put this  texture over here  Same and here also 
I have put the texture   And after that make sure  
that you are saving the file which is very  important  we don’t have to put here    
So, now what We’ll do, let’s  make some more space, control S*,  
That should be at the top  There we have to just  
put the windows  So, I will  select and just move it here   
One I need right now  And  we’ll just off all those   
So, as you can see,  
here is the part and just put it somehow here   
We’ll start painting for the same,  
whenever you are painting, you  should always open your model and see  
make sure that you are saving your  file, continue  Now, what I will do,  
﻿Hello everyone  So, as we have painted the  texture, now what I will do, I will just select  
And after that, for a time I will do one more  thing, on this and you can see it stretching  
quite well  That’s why we have to stretch  it out so that this square shape will form  
and also will decrease the size,  okay  So, we’ll select all of them,  
We’ll go to image and here you have the  UV snapshot, click over here and browse  
upper roof underscore zero zero one,  save the file and apply and close,  
okay  That part has been applied  And after that, next, okay, we have to just  
skip this  So, I’ll just go here and here we have  the files  So, i just put it in the Photoshop   
the roof part exactly  So, I will just select  this part and will put in the Photoshop   
this part, go to color and just click over  here  And just put that particular texture  
We’ll just rotate this, so we need  minus ninety  Put it somehow here,  
select and move  We’ll select all of them,  
you can see, is forming quite well   
What I will do, I will select this part  and delete the same  Select this part and  
will go to edit duplicate special   
I need in the Z direction,  so apply, rotate the same   
and now I will just go to this part and will  open the same  As you can see we have painted  
You can put whatever you want  here  So, you can put it  
And now, this part   
So, that should be like concrete   So, will go to UV, UV editor   
Now, I will go to r and just decrease  the size and just put it here  This part,  
And now, we’ll select all of them and  we’ll go to image, UV snapshot, browse,  
chimney underscore zero zero one,  save the file  Go to Photoshop   
Put it here, make a new layer, put it  the black color  As we have this part,  
this one also    
and all things is just lined up quite well, like  this way, okay  So now, I have the top part    
And now, Rasterize, delete, control D  
and the top part, so what I will do is, I  will just select this part and move it here  
blending  So, Rasterize layer  Select the  eraser, opacity is thirty three percent  Rub it  
okay, and rest is fine  I will  put it black, no problem    
And also we will just put this texture  over here, somehow here  Control d,  
right click, click horizontal, put  it somehow here  Off this black  
and just opacity little down, put it here   
So, as you can see, we have this part, So, I will  just select this area, particularly this area,  
So, I will just select this and will go to UV and  UV editor  As you can see, we have the top part  
showing, okay no problem    
Finally, this area   
UV, UV editor   
This part needs to be corrected   
Make new layer, go to the wood texture  
which is lying over here  So, I will go to UV  and just select this one  Put it somehow here   
as you can see, we have just made this and I  will just put the black part at the top  So,  
I will just make a box here   And now,  
so you can see, we just formed this part and  one more thing I have to do is make a box here   
Select this part, just the top and what I will  do is I will go to here and go to labels and  
Now, what I will do? I will  go to Maya, select this part,  
assign new material, Lambert and  click over here  Click here and  
And now,  
This one we don’t require, so what  happens, we’ll just select this part  
after that we will select this part, click over  here, click here and we will go to the panel,  
Now, we’ll select this part   
As I think at firstly, let us have a check is it  working or not  Go to file, click and select this    
I think we have to change the texture,  
Select both of them, control g, control d,  
control g and select this, go to window and  here you have the outliner  And we will go down,  
Control d  Select this, control d   
Control d   
I think we have to delete this   
Control d, shift d   
And now, select this section, control d,  
Move somehow here   
So, control g for group  That is the hut region   Shift control h for hiding  All those control g  
for group  And after that, you can see that the  hidden parts get hidden  We do not require this  
type of group which does not have anything  So, I  will just select this and delete, delete, delete  
and just shift h to unhide the scene   As you can see we have just formed this   
select the face  This is the face, okay   So, I have to just go to UV and planar,  
So, you can do this by yourself  Control s  for saving your file which is very important,  
and as you can see it is facing  in the Y direction, so Y, apply   
﻿Hello everyone  So, in this session, we will  start the UV unwrapping of this model 
there is that part   So, right now it is better to have another,  
another UV which is the planar  Obviously,  it is facing on the X direction, apply and  
yes definitely, casted  By default, it is very  large, no problem, will just move it somehow here   
Select this part  This is the top one  This is  the top, second and this would have to go here,  
okay  Just move it and just scale it down, scale  it down again and just move it here  Okay   
So, if you just go to edges, if you just select both  of them, as you can see, if you have selected  
one, automatically it will show that, this should  be attached  So, I will select both of them and  
do one thing, here you have cut and sew   So, you have to sew it, okay  So,  
and if you have cylindrical  surface, you can use the cylinder   
your edge will be sewed to each other  That’s the  benefit of UV and also I on this and just check  
whether this is fine or not  No, that is not fine   So, what I have to do, I will just go to UV and  
just select its part and just scale it manually  as you can see, now it is working quite well   
But, not the small one   So, I will just select the small one  
and just move it here and have to match the boxes   So that’s very important to match the boxes,  
okay  Fine, it’s working quite well  The  front part is fine but not this one  So,  
we’ll go to face, just select this  one, as you can see, it’s over here  
and what I have to do, just off this  And now,  will just go to UV and just select this UV   
At first, just select all of them, just move it  downward little bit, control z because we have  
selected this one also  We’ll select this part and  just move it downward and now select by holding  
If you open the UV, UV editor, so as you can  see, here is the toolkit of UV  So, i will just  
shift button, one o one point and after that just  move it down  So now, we have the gap of the,  
that should be at the top   That should be at the top and  
that should be at the down  So, we’ll just  manage it for a while  Just open it and just see,  
is it working  No, that, that’s  thing should be maintained  So,  
I think this is, okay, little  bit of problem is there   
And  
now, the problem has been shut  outed and control S, save the file   
As you can, we have just opened the UV of all  the parts  So, right now, we will just focus  
on the top because, yeah, definitely we have to  work for the same  Just select the top part only,  
we’ll select the top and obviously the  side one  First I will select the side one,  
drag this down little bit, okay, and will  just put somehow here  So, I can just click  
okay  Now, just go here   
As you can see, it is just enlarged, so  I have to just match through the same   
Open this  Now, the part has  been sort out, no problem   
That’s very important  Don’t stretch like this   
And also this one, so we’ll off this for  a while  Go to UV and just select points   
That’s this one that should  here, that should be there,  
okay  And, okay, rest is fine  Click  over here  Let’s manage the same   
This part need to be corrected at  first  Just select this part, this one  
over here and just click over here will found  this, okay  So, that’s the main feature of UV   
no problem  If your checker is different in size,  no problem  You can just save it like this   
As you have seen that we have just  opened the UV and now, in next session,  
we will open the remaining parts, so make sure  that whenever you are just working, just save  
your file which is very important  So now, you  have a proper UV which has been opened here  
and in next session we will just save the  file  So, I don’t require to open the UV  
at the downward because only paint  at front and this side and this one   
If the color of the UV is lighter or  darker, no problem, you can fix this 
Well, of all the features and parameters, right  now I will just in-isolate it and will just  
open the UV of the rest of parts like  this one, this one and this one, okay   
And click over here, you will just have this  UV toolkit and one more thing I have to do   
So, let us meet to the another session 
So, I need this panel, so right  now I will just off this  Okay   
If you see here, you will found the sub tools  which is just kept over here  That is the panel   
These are the few tools like move, rotate, scale,  as we do in the normal modeling  And will just  
minimize this little bit and make sure that  whenever you are working, you should have this  
area when you working for the UV and unwrapping  any of the object  You will keep all its file into  
So, let’s continue  So, what I will do, I will just  select the model, open the grid and just move it  
this  So, I will enter the same and just go to  the Photoshop for adding some textures  Okay   
Now what I will do, I will just make  this side and if I select this part,  
as you can see, the part is looking like this   So, we have to just open this by proper manner   
So, what I will do now, I will do  one thing is that, I will go to the  
As you have seen that we have selected the  front faces and now what I will do, I will  
just go to UV and here we have the planar   So instead of clicking over here, you should go  
to its property window  As you can see, it  is projecting in the Z direction, okay   
So, if this is projecting in the Z direction, we  have the Z axis and apply  As you can see,  
it is set over here  If you look, you will found  this  So, I will just move this for a while   
somehow here, okay  Now, as you can see, we have  just filled this model and we have to open UV   
We have to fix this part, as you can see, it  is not showing here but there is this part    
So, we will fix this laterwards  I will just move it here,  somehow here  And now will select this back part  
by holding shift button and again I think we  have to change this, I think to X axis, apply   
As you can see, because, you have to look at this  co-ordinate points  Now, this thing has just   
As you see the shape is very different,  okay, we will shut out this later  Okay    
Definitely we have to work for the same,  otherwise there would be a huge problem   
So, I will just select all of them  As you can see  what I am selecting, it’s just updating here   
That’s the fundamental of UV   That’s the main feature of UV   
So, I will select all of them  What I will do,  I will just go to the Z axis and just apply    
Now it’s separated, as you can see  So, we  have now two parts, this is the front one   
So, I will select this part at first and what I  will do, I will just go to the UV which is inside  
If I go here, you will find that this is  the front part and this is the back part   
This one is the back one, okay  So, here we  have some parts left  What I will do now,  
for a comfort way, I will just click this and  have the isolate selection  Now, I can see easily   
So, go to face, select the parts by holding  shift button, okay  And we have lift this one   
So, right now, you can see that it’s facing on  the X direction  So, I will go to X and apply,  
We have to just break this part,  
we have left one part, I  think  Two, three, four, five  
the modeling panel  So, UV, you have UV editor,  okay, but at first what I have to do, if I open  
part, which we have already  So, as you can see,  these are the garbage part which is just here 
And  if you want to open, you can but I think we do not  require, but still will open the same  Let us go  
to the UV and have the planar and as you can see,  we will allow it to project from Y axis  So, that  
is the main thing  As you can see, Y axis and just  project the same and this has been left  Okay   
So, we will sort out this later  As you can  see, we have just all sorts of UV which has  
been opened by us, and as you can see there is a  small panel for grid, checker  If I click here, if  
your checker is not in square, so as you can see,  these are not in square, these are in rectangle   
That means your UV is been disturbed   And that should be corrected, exactly  If  
you have like this type of checker forming  at your surface that means, this should be  
corrected, otherwise if you add some texture,  it will just stretch your texture like this    
UV, we will find that UV is looking like this  So, what I will do now, I will just select the  
So, it is very important to examine with this  That  is very important  So, I will go to UV toolkit   
And now, I will just off this because I do  not require it, the attribute editor  Okay   
So, I have now space, proper space for  managing all the things, and I will  
just synchronize it little bit because,  okay, we have to just examine it  
But, few things we have to take from here because this  is very important tool, which is UV shell tool   
What is this? We will just discuss this  in this topic only and as you can see,  
here we have some problems  So, I think we  haven’t opened this  Let us have a look,  
like this one and if I see this is stretching  so much, so I will select all of them,  
I will on this and just move it like this  So  as you can see, it’s not stretching too much   
part, like one by one I just select the part and  will just open the UV  So right now, I will just  
Let us fix the shape  It is very  important, okay  Same with this one    
Which part is this? This is the back  part, I suppose  So, as you can see,  
this would be very hectic, if you are in UV mode,  if you are selecting any vertex  If you need to  
select in one click, you have to click over here,  this is the UV shell tool  Just click over here,  
as you can see, all the things has been selected   So, I will just synchronize this down and move it  
somehow here, okay, and make sure you that you  are saving your file which is very important  
and also will just check this and just have  a look that it is working fine or not   
Okay, so we will manage this laterwards   
Okay now, we will synchronize this little bit   
Select this part   
use one or two things like planar unwrapping   So, I will go to UV and you have the  
That would be this one  So, it is stretching quite  very, not so high but yes we have to fix it   
We have a proper square,  then it would be fine, okay   
So, move somehow here because we are checking  the UV and will move somehow like this   
So, now, this part should be corrected  This  is that part and obviously, yes there is  
the upper part which has been connected  from here  We will shut out the same    
So, I am going to vertex and will off this  for a while and just select this vertex  
and will go to UV and move  As you can see this  part, this is that vertex which we have moved,  
control z  So, what I will do, just move this  downward, select both of them by shift selecting,  
will move this downward and now you  can just select both of them   
planar mapping, spherical and cylinder  So, it  depends on the shape  So right now, we have box like  
As you, This part is the upper one and this is  the lower one, okay  So, what I will do now,  
I will just go to the UV and just select that part  also, so will go to face and just select this one   
As you can see, it’s been merged here   So, we’ll go to UV again and just select  
this one by holding shift button  So, if you  are having this arrow which is very large,  
you can just press minus button to small it   So, that you have a proper handle, just move it  
downward a little bit  As you can see, this is the  top one and this is the bottom one  After that,  
here is the last one  So by plus you can  increase the pivot size and save your file   
So right now, what we have next, we have  this part  So, we’ll select this part  
and for that, what I will do, I will just  go to face and just select this part,  
okay  Just move it somehow here and just open it   As you can see the file is not proper, so just  
structure  So we will use the planar  Okay   And spherical also, when you have round surface  
﻿Hi everybody  So, in this session, I will make  another model which is also a exterior model and  
Just shift it over here  That would be the  one pillar and will duplicate the same    
But at first, I will just make the center  part  Now, what I will do, I will just go  
to face and just select this face  As you can  see, I am just making from this model only,  
okay  So, one more thing, I should have proper  spacing between them  So, just select this part  
and move it somehow here  Go to face and just  select this face, will move it somehow here 
No problem and will keep it here,  will just duplicate the same   
And now, that is the time to attach some  edges  So, I just putting some edges here,  
okay  And also I need some edges here  also  So, I will just need some edges here   
Select this face, select this part, move  it upward little bit, select this part,  
I will just open the UV for that  So, let us  start  So, I will make a model of a dam and  
move upward little bit  Okay  Now, we have to make the rest part  
like I will just select a box, make a new box  and now we will go to channel box layer editor  
and here we have some division width, height  So,  for width, I will press two, I need three I think   
Okay fine, and rest would be okay, no problem   Will just decrease the size little bit 
Will just adjust this laterwards  At first, I have  to just place it  And now, will go to insert  
edge loop tool, so I will just put some edge here  and only one I require  I just select the face,  
will delete the same  Select the face, delete  the same  Select the face, delete the same    
Now, you had a blank, blank space   
So, I am just off the grid and edge, double click,  select all the edges  This part also select it so,  
we have to select it manually, we will select the  three of them and just move it somehow here, okay   
what I will do, I will just go to box and now  I will just select this box and just move it  
Now, one more thing, right click  vertex, will select the vertex  
and press v for vertex map  As we have snag and  just like this vertex, shift select, right click  
and here you have merge vertices, okay  That is  the thing has been merged  Click here, control z,  
okay  Like this way, we just have to merge the  vertex  Same with this one, press v for vertex  
snap and just select this part  Shift by holding  right mouse button, merge vertices, merge vertex   
Okay  So, we have done this and now  
what I will do, one more thing I have to  do it  So, I will go to the front view  So,  
we have the front view and just on the grid  because we have to see the ground level  As you  
can see this going down, so will select this and  just move it here  This would be fine, no problem,  
somehow here and somehow here, okay  I think  this would be fine  One more thing I have do   
okay  So, will select this part and will  select both of them  Same we have did it,  
wireframe on shading and make sure you are saving  your file  So, I will save the file, okay   
So, I will just save, ext underscore zero zero one  We have saved the file and now  
we will go to vertex and select the vertices  and just move it downward direction and will  
select this part and just move it downward again  and one more thing we have to do  I think this  
would be fine and select both of them   Just move it at a grid  Let us have a look   
So, right now for quick examine purpose, I  just transparent it because I have to see the  
okay  We have to decrease the size, no  problem, will just fix it right now   
Will go to face, select this  faces, move it downward, the back  
As you can see, whatever I will click,  it is just forming in between the grid   
and we’ll also select this faces, move it  here  Ok, fine, I think this would be work   
This can be work  That’s a very dummy model  After getting your model to be done,  
then I will add some extra segments because we  have to open the UV in very low segment  Then,  
we will add some extra segment and just do the  detailing, So,okay, one more thing we have to do,  
we have to just give some edges here  Go to face,  select this faces, by shift selecting and move it  
we’ll just duplicate this one also here  Only  one time I will duplicate this part here and  
will duplicate this into all of them  Okay  Now, as you can see, we have formed our model  
and one more thing we have to do, I am just on  the grid for a while, will go to box and just  
select a box and just make a box and will put this  box at the downward region  As you can see here,  
So, I will go to create and here  you have the polygon primitives   
so right click, vertex  Because, I am forming  a dam, so I need a slope, okay  Object mode and  
we have to adjust it here  So, again will  just go to wireframe on shading, no problem,  
will off the grid  You can say we have to examine  carefully  So, will just put it somehow here  
and turn off the grid  Now, what I will do, I will just go to vertex  
and just select this vertex only and just move  it somehow here, okay  Here, this would be fine   
That is the slope  Face, select this  part, move it down  That would be enough   
So now, I have to duplicate this also like this  way, control d  And just select this and move it,  
shift d and will duplicate it, okay  But,  at first I have to go to the texturing and  
all and just put some texture, so that we  will just duplicate it  I think this would  
be fine and will just make a new box  Will  turn on the grid and just make a new box   
So, there is the interactive creation  I will  just check this, okay   Now, if you click here,  
Put the boundaries   
Okay, vertex, which I can do it in skill mode  also, but, okay let us prefer the vertex right  
again, just decrease, okay  Wait, I  think here would be fine  Object mode and  
right click, okay, we have to just  insert one edge here, somehow here  
and go to vertex, select this part, move it here   Face, select this part, move it here  Okay   
So, as you can see, we have just formed this dummy  model inside Maya two thousand eighteen  
Now, after having unwrapping and after  getting textured, I will just add  
some more segments so that when I press  three, it will not just look like this,  
okay  For that, I have to just make some  segments at the corners of it  And will just  
you have to drag this  That would be fine for me  right now  So, I will just select this part and  
will just increase the size, little  bit of it and move it somehow here,  
see like this and just move it and now right  click, face, will select this face  Extrude,  
﻿Hi everyone  So, welcome in this course  Now, I  will just open the UV of this part  So, at first  
as you can see, now it’s  looking quite well, okay  So,  
the top part should be managed   
UV and we’ll select this   Move it somehow here    
This part we don’t require because that is  the side part and we have to connect it 
Right click space, select part by part,  
okay  So, I don’t think so we require  the top part  And this part is fine   
And now we’ll go to UV and here you have the  planar  So right now, I will just go to Z  
axis and just apply it  As you can see here, it is  pointing towards the Z direction  So now, if you  
what I will do, I will just  isolate it  And right now,  
So, as you can see, we have opened  all the parts and now we have  
this part which is left, so I will  just select this and isolate the same   
Select the faces by selecting, shift selecting   
And now, go to UV and here you have the  planar  As you can see it is pointing  
towards the Z direction  So, I will go to Z and  apply  And now we’ll go to UV and UV editor   
Just select all of them   
Go to UV and here we have the planar  So now, it  is projecting from the Y, X direction  So I will  
if I go to the UV and UV editor as you can see,  we have still that particular shape because  
So, this part need to be shut out it  I will go to  UV and just off this checker  Select this points   
And shift select this one  Just move it   And just select this one  Move it here   
As you can see, the square which is forming  here is quite well but this portion,  
we don’t have to shut out it because we will just  copy this and we’ll just put it somehow here   
we have to open this  And now what I will do,  I just go to face and will select this part,  
three of them and will go to the UV  And  here you have the panel  So, I will select  
this  And as you can see, it is pointing in the  Z direction, so I will just apply it  Okay    
Now, at first I have to manage this,  so I will just move it somehow here   
And after that, what I will do,  
I will just go to UV and just select the points  like this part and just pressed a new and just  
move  Here, is the top part and this is  the center of it  Same with this one,  
﻿Hi everyone  So, in this session I will  just do the texturing here as we had  
This one that part and basically if I  go to the face, just select this one,  
okay  So, that’s the main thing and this is  the side one  No problem  Right click UV   
Okay  And now, we will select all of them, image  
and take a snapshot  Dam base  underscore zero zero one,  
and apply and close  We’ll go in  to the desktop, again we’ll just  
go to the desktop and just back, that’s  the base so we’ll just select this  
and just move it somehow here, okay  Make new  layer, move it at the down  And alt backspace  
to fill the black color, so that the lines will  visible it and rasterize the layer  Press B for  
make sure that it came nearby and  after that do the alignment    
okay  Now, one more thing we have to do   I’m going to the clone tool and here we have  
planars like, this one  So, what I will do  now, at first I will just go to new and  
going to therefore, okay, no problem  And if  I just paint here, we’ll make a new layer   
You can see it’s forming some tiles   So, I will increase the opacity,  
okay  As you can see here,  
so what I will do, I will  just select randomly    
Okay, I have selected randomly and we’ll go to the  level and just increase the value  As you can see   
Well, so we’ll select both of them, merge  layers  Control T and now we’ll just  
small this up, control Z   
Fine, and just crop the same data   
We’ll select all of them and just press R, and  just scale it down, okay  So, you can see, we have  
Now, what I will do again, define pattern,  
here we have the dam base and  now just off this for a while   
okay  As you can see, we have  painted but it is not looking  
realistic  So, what I will do,  I will just select this    
Going to the normal, click here and just  move it  We have to blend it at first   
Right click, assign new material  But at  first, we’ll just off this, object mode   
just scale it down and just zoom this out  And  one more thing, here we have the problem that it’s  
So, as you can see, we don’t require to just have  in this part because what I will do, I will just  
control D and just duplicate the same  So, we  don’t require that part  That’s the main thing   
Now, we have this part and  this part  And after that,  
getting overlapped, okay  So, what we’ll do, we’ll  have UV shell and just click here, and just move  
it somehow here  Click here and move it somehow  here, okay  Like this we will arrange the same  
data  We are in UV shell mode, so I will just put  all of them one by one and then I will just see  
that which part will go afterwards   And now, if I select this part,  
this is the side part, as you can see here,  that’s the side part  That’s the back part,  
that’s the front part  So, I will just put  this one and this one here, okay  This one,  
already did the UV unwrapping in the previous  session, so in this session I will just mainly  
That’s the top and maybe at the bottom, no  problem, we’ll just put it somehow here   
So like this part, this is the bottom one,  okay, we’ll select over here  And this one,  
this should be go here  Rotate the same   
And select this part, move it in between them   
You can see, we have aligned it   Select all of them and scale it up a little bit   
We are at proper vision of the data, so that  would be fine  And just select and just move it  
somehow here, okay  Now, as you can see, we have  just aligned it and make sure that whenever you  
are working, you should have a copy  So, I have  already make a new copy and then also I will just  
make some copy because the version is very  important, okay  So, underscore zero zero four   
Okay, continue   Now, as you can see, we have just  
put the painting over here and also we’ll just  complete the same and we’ll just duplicate it  
used the alignment and after that we’ll just  select this and we’ll go to the image and here  
we have UV snapshot  So, right now I am using two  seven eight eight PNG would be fine and desktop   
created in the desktop, dam underscore zero  zero one, just move it to the Photoshop    
And we have some cement texture  So, as  you can see, what else you have to do,  
just click a new layer or backspace and now  just put one texture maybe this would be fine   
And just move it somehow here  There is a  seams which is generating here  So, I don’t  
require this seam  So, what I will do, I will  just go to the clone tool and just right click  
rasterize the same and make sure that you have  to load the opacity, it is very important    
And just with your bracket button,  with your right bracket button,  
as we’ve discussed that this part should be  duplicated here  So, let’s get started   
it will increase the size of the brush  And with  your left bracket button, it will decrease it,  
okay  By pressing alt, you can click over here,  take the reference, paint it somehow here,  
okay  Just click click click, so that it just  produce a proper blend texture  Don’t use to just  
paint like this  You always use click button  so that the texture will blend betterly    
And as you can see, now it is looking quite  well, not bad at all  And just select this  
texture only and just move it somehow here,  okay  As you can see, there is a huge amount of  
you can say the seams which is generating  Okay,  no problem  We’ll just select both of them,  
right click merge and just select this,  and just move it somehow at the top, okay   
Make sure that whenever you are cloning  something in the Photoshop, always use the  
click button to clone for the same  Okay  And don’t paint anything in the zero layer,  
Now, what I will do, I will select this part and  at first I need to do one more thing, going to  
because that’s the UV layer which we  have extracted from Maya, okay  So,  
as you can see there is a problem, so I will just  put it somehow here  And just paint the same,  
okay  So, we have to just put it all across  our seam  So, I just making it more seamless,  
as you can see here   
And after that, select all of them, merge layers,  
select the clone  Select it and just paint it  like this  Random painting would be fine    
Make sure that we’ll not work in hundred percent  opacity, otherwise it just produce a jerk   
And using the soft brush for that,  you can change your brush from here,  
so I am using the first brush  which is the soft brush   
shading and here we have wireframe on shading   So at first, if you just go to the wireframe on  
okay  Now, as you can see, we have some parts  which is here and here  So, what I will do,  
I will just go to the panel and just put  some random texture as I will move here and  
just put some amount of random textures, and  with the help of this, put it somehow here    
That’s the random  And,  
so one more thing you can do, instead of using  this texture, I will just put this one in the  
separate panel  As you can see, I will put in the  separate panel  And what I will do, I will just go  
to the clone tool as you can see, we have pattern  tool also  And when you click on the pattern tool,  
it form a new pattern at the top, okay  So, what  I will do now, I will just go to the edit and here  
we have defined pattern  So I will just make a new  pattern, okay  The same, we’ll cut this off    
And we’ll just go to the pattern stamp tool and  decrease the opacity  As if you click over here,  
shading as we have discussed that if you don’t  select also then the wireframe will be shown   
it will form at the last, so that would be fine   So, I will just make some pattern like this, okay   
So, I don’t have to just go to have the image  
and just paint for the same  I just make  some pattern like this  That would be fine   
So, as we have completed then  we’ll just start working on the  
color correction and all later wards    
So, as you can see, we have painted all the  things in the Photoshop  And what I will do,  
I will just go to this tool or even the  laso, polygon laso tool, and just select  
part by part, as you can see, we have this part,  
no problem  And I will just select this part,  go to UV and we’ll just paint one by one,  
And now, what I will do, I will just  make a new layer which is the level,  
adjustment layer and just drag this down,  okay  So, you can see  And after that,  
Control, control Z because I think  here we required both of them   
Here also   
Make level again   
So, as you can see, we have found this  I will  just rendered the same data, control shift S,  
on shading, I’ll select this part, click  over here, and go to file, click over here  
okay  So, I have this part  So, as we have  discussed that the UV should be aligned here,  
Like this way, you can paint all of them  And  when you are satisfied with your work  If I press  
three, then the shape has gone  So, what else we  have to do? As you can see here, we have many many  
things like this and this also  I will just put  some random edges like going to next two line,  
just insert some edges  So, when we just use  the smoothing, it will not smooth so much,  
okay  If I press three, as you can see   
By focusing this part only three,  
so you can see, smoothing quite well   Not the upper one, but the lower one because  
it has proper segment here but not there  So, like  this way you can work  If it has proper segment,  
definitely it will smooth the same data,  okay  So right now, I am just removing all the  
segments, control S to save  And now,  we’ll just select this part UV, UV editor   
what happens now  We will just select all of  them by going to UV and just select at first just  
Hello everyone 
Control D*, move it here 
And specially this part 
If I press three, what happens?
See 
So, we’ll go to insert edges, okay 
One thing is that we have to just first select the faces 
Insert edges 
Insert some edges 
And after that we’ll just move it and just enlarge it 
Getting stretch, no problem 
Okay, just press three 
Examine the same 
Fine 
And just select this part 
I think, also have to select this one 
So, what I will do, I will, just go to insert edges and just put some edges randomly 
And just move it forward, okay 
So, that would be fine 
And we’ll not use the turbo smooth here 
We’ll not use the three button 
Otherwise it’s just form like this, no problem 
But, we’ll just put it one only and, so as you can see here, we had to just go through
the insert edges and just put some edges 
Control G for group 
And so, we had the outliner here 
So, this is the group part 
Control D*, just move it here 
And shift D, control Z 
Now, we’ll select this part, right click, UV shell, select this and just move it somehow here 
Control D* 
Select this part, both of them 
Move it at the centre 
This part 
Control D* 
Or you can do one more thing 
Hi, everyone 
So, in the previous we have just setup all the things and in this session we will just
make some duplicate copies 
So at first, I will just select this and as you have seen that we have just moved the
I think that’s the part, okay 
P word by pressing D* here 
And what I will do, I will just select this 
As you can see that its facing in the X direction, which is here, in the X direction 
So, I will go to edit 
And here you have the duplicate special 
We’ll click over here 
And as you can say the scale value, which is X, Y and Z, which is all in minus, okay 
So, I will put the X value in minus one and apply the same 
So, it will just create the copy over here 
And, okay 
No problem 
One more thing we have to do, we’ll just go to duplicate special 
At first we’ll reset it and then we’ll just minus one 
Apply, close 
So, the problem is sort outed because as you can see here also we have the minus one earlier,
so the problem is sort outed 
And here, just click over here, and press D* again and just move it at the corner, okay 
I think here would be fine 
I’ll select this and just move it somehow here 
Here would be the, here would be fine, okay 
Now, we’ll go to edit and duplicate special 
We will increase the size 
Click 
As we have just did the duplicate special, so I will just put somehow here 
And we’ll put somehow here, okay 
Control S, make sure you are saving a file which is important 
Select this control D*, move it here 
So, this control D*, move it here 
Like this group, control D* 
Move it here 
And select this part, control D*, move it here 
Click the checker 
As you can see we have formed this 
Select this, go to the front view 
First save your file 
And as you can see, like this I will put, because I don’t have to open the UV here 
I will just put somehow like this and we’ll do the editing in the compositing software 
So, hope now you are understand the concept of UV, how you can just put the texture and
all into that 
Work in only one and to the copy of all 
So, like this way you can work 
And I will just save my file in a new scene 
This would be connected, so we don’t have to paint the texture of this 
Continue 
Like this way, you can work quite well 
So, we have focus this part and also the top, that would be fine 
Because, this part will connect to the rest of them 
In previous session we had just opened the UV and also lay out the same and just putted
So, we don’t require to just take the texture 
And now, what happens next, we have this part which is the this one 
So, I will do just increase the size 
Move it somehow here, select them and just move it here, okay 
That is the down part 
This one specially 
Click and just have a look at the texture 
It’s stretching 
We’ll rotate this, okay 
We’ll just rotate somehow here 
the texture over here and here 
Same with this one 
This is off, so we don’t require it 
Obviously if you want to paint, you can 
And, okay that is the side one 
And this is basically the back part, so we don’t require this 
So, I’ll focus on this one, the top, and this one, then the side one 
We don’t require to just focus on the side 
This part and we’ll just put somehow here 
This part also we don’t require 
So, we’ll just scale it down 
And so in this session, I will just put the texture here as we have already opened the
Yeah, this part we require and what is this?
No, we don’t require 
And, and the last one 
This one 
Okay, so just click on the checker board 
Rotate the same 
So, now we had a proper layout and we’ll go to UV 
Just select all of them, image 
And this would be the side part 
UV, but I have to align the same 
UV snapshot, dam, side underscore zero zero one 
Apply and close 
This one 
Move it to Photoshop in a new tab and just go, you’re the previous file and previous
texture and we’ll just go to Photoshop again 
Make a new 
And after that what else we require, we’ll just select this part, shift and drag here 
We’ll move somehow here 
And after that what else we have to do, just go to the clone, clone tool and we’ll just
So, what I will do, I just select all of them and by holding UV and just select all of them
click manually 
So, right now, I am just selecting this texture and just put it somehow here 
Just move it 
Increase the size 
And go to blending mode, move your arrow button 
You have a clear examine 
Just turn the opacity down 
Okay 
So, go to Maya again 
and just go to press R button, just scale it down little bit and just pull it here 
And the rest is I think fine 
So, we’ll just select this, that’s the top part 
That should be this one, darkened 
okay 
As here we have the gate region, so I’ll just select like this manually and just make
a new layer 
Click, go to level, okay 
Now, one more scene, control T  If I just drag this, you can have more space for that 
Okay 
And now let’s have a check, but at first one more thing I have to examine 
So, what I will do now, I will just select one of the part 
At first we have to just make the copy and we’ll just save scene 
And, and after that what happens next, we’ll just, as you can see, you can fix this and
you know how to fix 
I’m not using the back part, that’s why I just leave the back part 
So, because we have scene from the front 
So as you can see, this is the front part as this region, specially this one 
We have to scene from the front end 
We’ll extrude it, okay, little bit 
some edges like this and you are opening UV, that would be very hectic 
Putting some edges here 
Now, you have a smooth result 
If I press one, here a hard plus three that is smooth 
Select this part 
So, that should be here 
﻿Hello everyone, welcome back to the class  So,  today we will discuss about the 3D painting,  
what I will do, I will just focus on this model  and just paint it  I will use this color also,  
manual color and also the paint effects for that   So, what I will do, I will just select this    
As you can see, if I press five, the texture  will be gone, because we are in shaded mode   
If you press four, we are in wireframe  But if  you press six, then we are in texturing mode   
And if you hit on seven, it would be black,  because there is no light present  Hit on seven   
As you can see, there is no light present  I  will just select this model and delete the same   
subdivision mode which is three   If you press one, definitely  
you can go to the hard end view  Okay  So, I am pressing three and now I will just  
drag all those things and I need some more space   So, what I will do, at first I will go to one,  
and as you can see buttons are separated from each  other  So, right now I am not using the buttons,  
but I will just paint in this area  And for that,  what I will do, I will go to rendering tab, as you  
can see here  And we have the texturing panel  If  I click over here, you have 3D paint and tool  So,  
at first I will show you in a sphere, if I take a  sphere, okay and just put it some more here    
And if I just select this sphere, make sure  that whenever you are working, you should  
always just clean the history because the  history we don’t required  This is the sphere,  
right click assign new material and I will just  put Lambert  Okay, no problem  As we’ll off the  
texturing with the third party render engine  in Maya application  As you have now a clear  
attribute editor for a while  Just select this  sphere, go to texture and here you have the 3D  
paint tool  Instead of clicking over here, I’ll  go to its property features  As you can see,  
whenever I just click, the window will  come just left of your screen  Okay    
So now, as you can see, we have some sort  of brushes which is present over here   
We have scale and width value also  We have paints  effects and this one, this is the gate to brush   
That’s the color, that’s the floor   So, we’ll discuss it one by one  
and we have lots of more features  Few of them  are hidden because we haven’t taken the brush  
So, I will start from this, soft brush  As you can  see, I am going here in the new model, it is not  
updating and it is not working, as you can see the  brush pointed is just forming the cross sign    
That means it will not apply on your model, okay   So, what happens now, if I go down as you can see,  
idea about how you can generate UV maps and how  you can work with a UV editor in Maya software   
we have file textures  You have to define the  proper space where your texture want to go  
and where your texture will save  And where  it will generate some cache memory    
So, file texture is very important  Assign  edit textures  Just click over here   
You have assigned edit textures  So, I will  increase the size  By default the value would be  
around five twelve  So, you can increase this  So, I have just increased by  
two thousand forty eight, okay fine   And the image format which is Maya f,  
so I will change it to JPEG  That will take little  amount of time and do assign edit textures, okay   
Now, as you can see, it has been updated and  it’s not producing any kind of cross sign   
So, here we have the color  Click over here, you  can have all the colors which you want to paint   
You have the second, first the primary color   And I will just change the primary color    
So, in this session, we will discuss,  how we can directly paint on to the model  
So, whenever you are painting, you will found  that it will overlap on your model, okay   
If you want to paint, you can definitely, if  you want hard brush, you can have a hard brush   
If you want the corner soft brush, you have the  soft  If you have the faded brush, you can have,  
okay  There are different mode scenes  Like  if you are painting like this, if you go down,  
and you have the blur  So, if you  click over here, you will found that  
it will just allow you to blur the same   As you can see, it will allow you to blur   
That means, you can have the freedom  of having fully painting things   
So now, it is just blurring your  You are blurring  your whole painting  If you go to paint, if you  
want to erase, you can just put it over here  It  will erase off your file which you have painted   
okay  So if you want to increase the brush  size, definitely you can increase from here   
with the help of several brushes available  into the Maya software  Let’s switch to the  
But for the shortcut, if you press B and  hold your left mouse button and just drag,  
you can find that the radius of  the brushes gets changed    
Now, you can just erase all the  things which you have painted,  
okay  And we’ll just press B and just drag your  left mouse button again  And we’ll go to the soft  
brush and I will go down and just go to paint,  okay  So, here are much more things  If you want  
to just add some images, you can add from here,  okay  If you want to add some painting effects,  
you can add from here  And few of the given here  which is this one, this is the vicer part    
So, here we have the paint effects  So, as you can  see, these are the small presets which is formed  
here and which is always been there in the Maya   So, if you want to work for any of the preset,  
you can work  As you can see, here we have the  flowers, flower mesh and all  If I just click  
over here, and we’ll just close this for a while,  and as you can see, it will update on your sphere,  
okay  There is a seams in between them  because the image which you are painting  
is been the over from this position and we’ll  start from there  So, that’s the seam  Okay   
Like this you can paint easily, whatever you are  going to paint  You can also add some colors, that  
means you have to go to this brush, click over  here again and just paint the same, okay, control  
Z  I will click over here  Now, if you need little  bit of randomness you can just paint like this,  
okay  So, it depends on you that whatever you  want to paint, you can definitely paint  And the  
next tool which is the paint operation, the paint  erase clone blur will all effect in this  As you  
can see, it is effecting on your screen and also  it will effect your vicers which you have taken,  
which is the presets   This is the blur intensity  If I increase  
Hello everyone, so in this session we will  learn about the process of 3D paint and texture  
this to twenty, it will just have a huge amount of  blur, if I decrease this by three, it will produce  
some small effect of blur on your painting  So,  if I just increase this to ten, it would be fine,  
okay  So, it depends on your  That  means you have to keep on changing   
And after that you have the stroke, okay  Stamping  space  If you are painting something like I have  
taken this brush and also if I paint, as you  can see, if I go downward, which is the stroke,  
if I just increase the value, what happens?  You will found that the points is forming because  
the continuity has been breaked  So, if  you just click like this, the value is  
zero point zero  And if I increase this little  bit, now it forming some sort of points  So, I  
pressure  If you are using the pen tablet, you can  just put this stylish pressure on  And you have  
inside Maya application  So, as you can see,  we have this model  So, I will just do the  
the display, which you have seen here  Drawing  outline, okay, drawing brush feedback  Okay   
That means it will be shown in the viewport   No problem  And here we have same thing which  
is assign edit textures  And if you want to save  your texture as a proxy file, you can definitely  
click over here  And just define a particular  path  Your file will be saved  Right now,  
I have just selected this part at first  Then if  I click over here, it will definitely go to my  
document folder of Maya, okay  So, paint  operation its fine and you can change from  
anything  If you want to erase, you can erase   And these all things are painting in only one  
layer, okay  So, you can erase, or even clone  or even blur  That depends on you  Opacity,  
definitely if, if I just click over here, and  just make some new color, like red and if I click,  
as you can see, the color is very harsh  If  we just decrease the opacity, as you can see,  
3D paint and texture in this model  So, if I  select this, if I press three, as you can see,  
it is getting affected, okay   Like this way you can work   
Now you can see, it is really getting  affected  So, this is the hundred percent    
This has been decreased and this is much  more decreased  So, I will just put it one,  
which is by default present in Maya  And you can  say hundred percent, okay  Like this so you can  
have some sort of brushes  This is the projection  brushes  You can just click over here and just put  
some images if you want  But, you have to take  the images from, from the image folder, okay   
So right now, as you can see, we have  a couples of different things    
If I go to print effects, and if I  just go here, you have pastels, paper,  
You have that’s tree, tree mesh and all the  things which you want to make, okay  So right now,  
the model is simple and also it has the shape, and  also the polygons are smooth  Because, we are in  
Hi everyone 
And if you go out, it will just stop, because we have applied this one to here 
And after that just go to assign edit texture, same, edit texture 
And now you can have the freedom to just a proper painting EO model and you can achieve
a good result with simple painting inside Maya application 
So, let’s meet to the next session 
And now what I will do, I will just press three for some division access 
Or even you can go to one and after that, we’ll just go to the rendering tab, as you
can see here in rendering tab 
And at first you go to texturing, here you have the 3D paint tool 
So, I will click over here 
And now as you can see, we have this painting which is not applying any model that means
just go down and you have the assign edit texture, click over here 
Its size is which we have taken two thousand forty eight 
And this is in a square, okay 
So, assign and edit texture, okay fine 
So, in this session we will learn about how you can paint the 3D texture and how you can
Define and as you can see, if I just paint, it will just allow me to paint in the model 
So, that’s the main thing 
If you press three, sub division access happens, so don’t worry about the scene 
What I will do, I will just paint some textures over here 
So, let’s start 
So, I will just click over the color 
And just paint somehow little bit of pinkish, like this one 
And what I will do now, I will just press P and hold my left mouse button and just increase
the size 
So, I will just paint like this at first 
just put the texture over here with the help of Maya 
As you can see, if the model is been separated from each other, then means, that means you
have to just select that model scene go to texture and 3D paint tool 
If your UV is not been open it will produce some amount of problem, as you can see here 
So, you have to just keep on just driving your brush, then it will be sort outed, but
make sure, whenever you are working in any of the file, you should have opened the UV
at first 
Because, you know how to open the UV 
And as you can see, we have just painted the texture over here 
Each and every part is kept spendthrift 
So, I’m in Maya two thousand eighteen 
And now, we’ll just press V and just drag your left mouse button to give you the size 
What I will do, I will just go here and have this particular one 
So, here we have a different things, like whatever you want to just make, you can definitely,
you have to just go through the same and just pick any of them 
So, I’m picking the this one, this is the flower, so I will just click over here 
And as you can see the opacity is hundred percent, which is one point zero, okay 
I will just put some amount of flower here and we later change it 
Here, we will put some amount of random flower like this 
Spread these thing some amount of seems there, no problem 
So, at first I will just select the model and just go to the edit and here we have the
So, like this flower I have just putted and after that I will just go to the top, click
over here and have some different material 
So, I will go to the flower wheel, have some shot of flower mesh also with this just at
your screen 
So, we have this flower 
So, you can put it anything if you want to put that means, if you just want to put that
thing, you can just click like this 
Definitely it will just allow you to just put on your model 
So, as you can see, the part which is not open in UV is getting print out, that means
the opening of the UV is very important 
delete by type stream 
Now, I’ll just put like this, no problem 
You have to open the UV at first, then you can just work for the same, like this way 
And for this, I can use the simple texture 
And as you can see, there is a strip line, so I will just go to the brush again, click
over here and just go to the table* of art improve 
I have to define just the shape, so I will just select the heart brush and now, what
I will do, manually I will just go to B and just drag this down and I think this will
So, I have just printed this part which is the rough part 
I, you can just paint well with the help of proper UV opened and then you don’t have
So, I will clean the test <?> </?> first and then I will select the model right click,
just about the problem which we are facing here 
So, as you can see here, also we have some problem, you can just do it well 
Click over here if you need to add the color 
Click and that color has been added, you can just drag it like this and just press B and
at first just increase the size, just drag it like this, definitely it’s going to work,
as you can see 
You have to keep on painting like click and click 
That would be applicable 
If you want to just paint in this part, you can have to paint and for this part also,
you just go to color and just go to that particular color and just click over here 
and here you have the assignment material 
Click here, somehow here and just press B and just drag it out, you can just paint like
this 
So, if you open the UV, as you can see, there is a problem here 
You have to just click and click 
Then you don’t have to find this type of problem 
So, it’s facing right now, okay 
With the help of painting, you can just achieve a good result and with the help of a simple,
you can say, simple modification of your brush, you can have a good, as, as you can see here,
we have the clone angler and all 
And here we will go to the Lambert 
So, as you can click over the blur, you can blur this out easily 
So, we have discussed this in previous session 
So, you can just blur this out easily and you can work for twelve with the help of the
modification which we are having here 
So, with the help of this common features, you can just do it well 
So, hope you understand this, the concept of this painting 
If you want to just select any other model, just select that model and do one more scene,
right click, assign new material and Lambert it again 
So, later to be separated, that would be fine texture and 3D paint, click over here and
same what we have did it, click and it’s not replying 
So, that thing has been assigned 
﻿Hello, welcome back to the session  So, today  we will discuss about the most important thing  
you want to hide, you can hide your thing   Or double click, you change the name if you  
want to  Or even you can just put  the color  So, when you are hiding,  
okay, that thing will be changed  So, right  now, leave it here  And so whatever you are  
going to make, you can make in layers that would  be fine  And also that would be beneficial when  
you are working in layer render  So, what is  render layers, we will have a proper class and  
a separate class for layer renders   So, hope you understand the concept of UV,  
how you can just produce the UV map and how you  can unwrap the data from the model  And after that  
just make one and just copy the same data, okay   So, let’s continue to the next session 
will just make some duplicate copies  So,  at first, I will just select this    
And as you have seen that we have just moved the  P word by pressing D here  And what I will do,  
I will just select this  As you can see that its  facing in the X direction which is here, in the  
X direction  So, I will go to edit and here you  have the duplicate special  Will click over here  
and as you can see the scale value which is X,  Y and Z, which is all in minus, okay  So, I will  
put the X value in minus one and apply the same   So, it will just create the copy over here    
And okay, one more thing we have to do, we’ll  just go to duplicate special  At first we’ll  
reset it and then we’ll just minus one  Apply   Close  So, the problem is sort outed because  
s you can see here also we have the minus one  earlier, so the problem has sort outed  And here,  
just click over here  And press D again,  and just move it at the corner, okay   
of any 3D application, that’s called the render  or the render setting  So, whatever we are  
I think here would be fine  I’ll select  this and just move it somehow here   
Here would be the, here would be fine   Now, we’ll go to edit and duplicate special   
Click, as we have just did the duplicate special   So, I will just put some more here  And we’ll put  
some more here, okay  Control S, make sure that  you are saving your file, which is very important   
Select this, control D  Move it here   So, this is control D, move it here   
And we’ll go to window and here we have  the outliner  Select this group  Control D   
Move it here, and select this  part, Control D  Move it here    
As you can see, we have formed this  Select  this, go to the front view  First save your file   
And as you can see,  
like this I will put because I don’t have to open  the UV here  I will just put somehow like this and  
working into the Maya application or any kind  of 3D application, definitely if you not follow  
we’ll do the editing in the compositing software   So, hope, now you understand the concept of UV,  
how you can just put the texture and all into  their, just work in only one and to the copy  
of all  So, like this way you can work   And I will just save my file in a new scene   
Continue  Like this way, you can work quite well   
So, if I click over here, that’s  the render setting  So, you found,  
we are using Maya software, definitely yes  And  you have all the features like file output which  
format you want to save and I will save in JPEG  and what would be the frame range  So, if you are  
animating something, you should just put the frame  range  And perspective is fine  Preset which is,  
I think I will use ten eighty P right now   And also just put it some more here,  
like this  And if you just click over  here, you have the film gate  So,  
the particular proper render settings, the output  would be not appropriate  So, after completion of  
this part would be renderable  I will just zoom  this quite a bit, okay  If I just click over here,  
you will found that the thing is  get rendered in the Maya software   
As you can see, the thing is get rendered  And  yeah, we have to just adjust the light, so it  
will just produce a good result  So, here we have  the exposure and the gamma gain value  So, you can  
just manipulate your thing from here also   And also we have, if you just click like  
this and just go here, you can click over  here  And just the render view will change,  
okay  That’s the thing where you can work for  the render  If you want to work here only,  
that means you want to render in this part, I  will just drag this and just click over here  Now,  
Now, it will render only this part, okay, not the whole  one  That’s the snapshot  That means you will just  
skip the snapshot of the particular model  And as you can see, it’s generating in the  
this all, generating UV maps, 3D painting tools,  the types of shader, now it is time to get learn  
wireframe  So, I will just go to the render  view again and just render the same data    
So, like this way you can work, okay  So, here we  have more features like keep image  If you keep  
your image, you can have a quick comparison  If  I just increase keep image click, as you can see,  
there is only one image and how much image you  want to keep, you can  If I just rotate this,  
and click over and have another view  And if I just go here, as you can see,  
we have both references  At first we have keep the  image and then we have just another render 
So, like this way you can keep as much as image as  you can, click here, so it will just have three  
frames, as you can see  So, the last one, I  will just go here, somehow here like this   
And just render the same data  So,  as you can see, we have three, one,  
two and three  So, like this  way, you can keep your image    
how we can go with a proper render settings   So, there are several tools, several menu  
You can delete your image from here   You have render setting which is just  
present here  You have file, where you can just  put your file and just call up your images  You  
have the view region, you have the rendering  tab which you are getting here, which all came  
in this particular  You have the IPR, so IPR  render, you can have the perspective, because  
I’m working in the perspective click here  And  now it will generate the IPR render engine    
As you can see, okay  So, we have generated the  IPR and you can just click and just refresh the  
IPR image  So, as you know that IPR stands for  the Interactive Photo Realistic Rendering, which  
is only available in Maya  So, it will produce  some amount of photo realistic rendering  But,  
you have to undergo through lighting on many  various textures also  So, we will discuss  
this step by step, okay  And you have the gain and  gamma value, so by default value would be one    
available into the Maya render view  So, one o  one, we will discuss all the render view option  
And here we have the value which is also one   So, you have the display panel all channels  If  
you want to click the blue, it will show the blue,  green, green and red rend  And you have the alpha,  
it will just produce the alpha channel,  okay  So, like this way you can work  
quite well  And also you have this play and  pause button  So, as you can go here, we have  
the Maya software  So, the quality is custom  and the edge unrealistic is low quality    
If you go to high quality, definitely the timing  will be more and also if you are using any kind of  
motion in your scene, you can check the motion  blur, which we will discuss in the animation  
chapter  And here you have rate racing quality   If you have something which is transparent and  
have glassy kind of nature, then you can check  the rate racing  So, if the light get bounced,  
that thing will just produce some amount  of effects into the nearby objects    
in Maya application  Let’s switch to the software  to get better understanding how we can utilize,  
So, if you click over here, you have reflection  refraction  So, in lighting session we will just  
work for the same  And here also we have  IPR option, so make sure that its check  
when you are working in here  And if you are just  rendering the same data, you have the panel, okay,  
you have particular panel  So, you can undergo  through many changes  With the help of the  
Maya software, the common, common is basically  the where you want to keep your image,  
or where you want to change the image size   And if you need more exactly the more size,  
you can go for four K and resolution is seventy  two  So, you can put it three hundred  By default  
the value of resolution in Maya is seventy two   So, if you putting three hundred, definitely  
little bit time will be increased and also  we have pixel inches, okay  Because we have  
just set at this pixel inches, by  default value is also been the same   
how we can use the render view with the  help of Maya software render view settings   
Expect ratio would be a pixel and the maintain  ratio set at two pixel, no problem    
And one more thing, as you can see here, the image  size is showing with seventy two DPI, and also  
if you go here render using, we have this Anrold  render engine  So, it’s a third party plugin, and  
also it produce some amount of realistic render   If you click over here, the panel really changes   
So, it depends on your render engine  So, we have  separate classes for Arnold render engine  Now, I  
am just working in the Maya software because it’s  a basic and you have to start from here  Okay   
Master layer is fine, because we are rendering the  master layer because all the things which is kept  
here is the master layer, so I’m just off the  grid and the you can get also, if you click here,  
going to the channel box, as you can see, here you  have the layer option  Create new layer  Now, you  
can just click, right click at selected object   So, if you want to hide, you can hide, okay  If  
Hi, everyone  So, in the previous we have just  set up all the things  And in this session we  
Hello everyone, welcome back to the class  So, in module fourteen,
So, we will not focus in this, we will see laterwards 
Go to Indirect Lighting and there is the physical sun and sky 
Just create and when you create, in the right- hand panel you have the Attribute Editor 
In Attribute Editor there are two different tabs which have been created when you created
the physical sun and sky 
When you created the two tabs has opened 
This is mia Physical Sky one 
This is the sun direct 
This is the coordinate points of the sun 
And this is basically mia Physical Sky 
So, now, let's switch to the Maya application and have look how you can work with the IBL
As you can see here, we have our physical sky and sun 
Somehow over here 
it's very small 
Whenever you are making physical sun and sky, this directional light will form 
So, what you have to do press R for scale 
I will just scale this up 
Now, as you can see, whenever we have created the physical sun and sky, Final Gather will
on automatically So, Final Gather is very important 
It will just smooth enough your whole you can say your whole image, and your whole render 
and to the physical sun and sky 
And it will generate some soft glow and soft light into it 
So, accuracy, if you increase the accuracy, definitely your quality will be enhanced and
also the render time will increase 
So, now for this time I will just off this render setting, but we will do in further
you can say further experiment laterwards 
So, I will just off this 
Now, as you can see, we have just increased the size of the directional light which has
been formed by applying physical sun and sky 
So, if I entered this, I will go to View and here we have the Bookmark view one 
You can also use camera, but for camera we have separate tutorial you can look at it 
Hello everyone  So, in
Now, I will just render the same data, and what we will found as you can see, the image
size has decreased because we are in very low amount, low quality image 
So, if I zoom this, as you can see, it's like morning light 
So, I will just put over here somehow 
If you just rotate this light and what you will found if I rotate like here and if I
rendered it again and what I will found, let’s have a look 
Now, you can see that it's get little bit of dull okay 
As you can see it get little bit of dull and also when you rotate much, then it will dull
the whole scene 
So, what we have else 
this session we will learn about the Mental Ray, physical sun and sky 
If you just put like this what happens, let’s see 
But, at first, I will make a new version  So,
we will Save this file 
We have already make a new version and we will make another version, so ‘Great Britain
scene zero zero two underscore zero zero two’ 
Save 
I just saved in maya binary 
Continue and if I have just rotate this particular direction of light, and if I rendered the
scene, what I will get? See 
Animations_1717
So, let's continue 
As you can see it just gets more darker and it’s kind of afternoon light 
If you rotate this, it will just rotate your temperature also 
If this is <?>slantly</?>below, the arrows are <?>slantly</?> below, then what happens?
The light would be much more brighter as compared to this one you have the sharp shadows and
it is also called morning light 
As you can move like this, I will just cut for a time 
As you can move like this, your rendered will be more darker as compared to the previous
one 
So, like this way, you can adjust 
As you can see, it's getting quite darker 
As you can see, we have this model and we have just putted one plane 
As you can see, that it's a late evening kind of light 
And also, as you look that sun is I think below here 
So, it’s reflecting and it’s casting the light over here, over here also 
As there is a little bit of bounciness as you can see, the upper part is darker and
the lower part is lighter 
So, gradient is forming in the sky and also, we have some sort of bounciness of light 
As you can see, so like this way, you can add your Mental Ray physical sun and sky,
it's very important 
So, if you are working in one light, you should work two or three lights more, you can add
two or three lights which we have discussed earlier 
At first you have to define the camera 
And also, one more thing is that, if I go to Attribute Editor 
So, you have Mental Ray Physical sky and you have one more thing which is Mental Ray Physical
Sun 
If you go to physical sun, you have the shadow softness which is just below 
So, if I select this and you can go to Attribute Editor and here you have the mia physical
sun one 
So, inside it you have physical sun attributes 
By default, it is just taking the rotation axis of your, if you rotate the value will
definitely change because it's linked to it and also you have one more thing which is
shadow softness 
So, what I will do, I will go to here, which is Film Gate and just put it so whatever come
So, by default it is one 
So, if you need a little bit of you can say soft shadow, so you have to just increase
it and what you have to do if one more thing is that if your light is just like this 
If I render this <?>E</?>, what you are getting?
Let's see 
As you can see, it's getting quite harder and also you can say the intensity is also
high 
and put somehow like this 
What happens let's see 
inside it, it will not render the same 
See the front part is getting darker and the back part is getting lighter and also the
shadows generating here 
So, here we have the light which is very much, you can say have high intensity 
So, what I will do, I will just Control Z or even Command Z, if you are in MAC 
So, but you can just change like this and so I will just move this little bit and we'll
I think this would be fine 
So, as you can see the part of the shadow 
So, I will just do one more thing 
It will only render this part so you have to just zoom it 
we will learn about the getting familiar with image-based lighting
We just increase this a little bit 
As you can see, your shadow is not so hard or not so soft 
Because you don't have the crease point like here or you don't have the gradient 
So, if you go to a MIA physical sun one which is inside Attribute Editor and it has sub
panel like physical sun attributes 
So, here you have the shadow softness 
So, what we will do, we will just increase the Shadow softness, by twenty two or you
can also put some texture into the shadow softness 
As you can click over here, the create render node will be formed so you can call up your
I am pressing ALT and right mouse button to zoom 
file or use any of the texture which is situated over here 
Now, I will just off this and cut the scene and we have samples also 
But at first, we should check this part 
What happens let's see 
Now, as you can see it's getting quiet 
You can say merged and also it has very much <?>feather</?> 
So, you can increase the part of shadow softness if you increase more, it will spread more 
So, we will not increase more 
And you have the samples 
As you can see the grains are forming over here 
After that just position your scene, so that it will render that particular part 
If I zoom this, as you can also know that we are in low quality 
But, if you still want to work in the grains, here you have the grains 
So, what you have to do just go to shadow softness, and we have just increase it by
twenty-two okay fine 
But we will go to samples for targeting this particular grains 
So, samples we will increase somehow around, I think Seventy 
So, you can increase it according to your need 
As you can see, the grains has left 
But we have still little bit of grains because we are in low quality, that's why it's pixelating
So, I will put somehow like this and what I will do, I will go to View and here we have
your image 
So, if you increase the samples around seventy to hundred, then it would be fine 
Otherwise, it will take a huge amount of time also 
So, if you're increasing shadow softness, you have to increase the samples also, because
you have to trigger that particular grains 
As you can see, it's softening quite well and also the grains which are forming there
is also lost 
So, like this way you can increase and one more thing if you want to add extra lights
with it, you can do it well by going to rendering and you have the another lights 
As you know, just click in the light and it form a new light, and you can just use it 
the bookmarks, so edit Bookmark, and I will just define a particular bookmark 
And also make sure that whenever you're working in a file, you should at least apply some
texture 
So, that it will look quite well 
And also, one more thing is that, whenever you are using the Mental Ray physical sun
and sky, make sure that always your final gather will be on 
And also, we will be on the global illumination 
So, you can increase the accuracy if this is hundred by default you can increase by
one twenty to one fifty 
But if you have a good PC configuration you can go beyond one fifty 
So, one more thing accuracy in global illumination is entirely different as compared to the accuracy
in Final Gather 
So, we are not using any caustics material here 
So, we will not include the caustics 
What is caustics we will discuss it next session 
In common tab you have a few features like Image Format, we discussed this and also Compressing
Quality 
Compressing Quality will work basically, when you are doing some renders into sequence which
is also called Batch Render 
Enable Colour Management we don't required Colour Management because we are using our
own thing and <?>own light</?> and all 
After that, what we will do?
So, yeah, the size of the image is also very important and it’s resolution 
So, by default which is Seventy-Two 
You can increase this to three hundred 
That means you can zoom and it will not pixelate as compared to this Seventy-Two resolution 
And yes, Maya is a vector software 
But if you are using any model and you are working in a model and you are just having
the final output, it can pixelate if you are working in a model and the final output is
JPEG, PNG or any other format 
So, Indirect Lighting, this tab is very important 
Quality, filter is <?>gauze</?> that means, the light which will eject from this source
If we change our view, then we should finally go to Bookmark and here we have that panel 
will bounce and filter size will be three and three okay, fine 
And quality is Zero point Twenty five 
If you increase little bit and have a look, let's have a look at the quality 
We will go to View, Bookmark and View one 
Let's have a test render 
I think now it will take some time, because if you have a heavy scene, it will take some
time as compared to the single and lighter scene 
So, scene is also depends on your graphic processor 
If you are working in heavy scene, that means you should have a good PC configuration okay 
So, as you can see, the light is bouncing quite well and also producing some shadow
So, it will jump to that particular panel which we have bookmark in that particular
as we can see because we have just implemented like 
And also, we have changed the angle of the camera 
It's not straight, it's tilted somehow you can say or also it is like two-point perspective 
So, you can change your camera view accordingly if you just experimenting and if you need
to set up some camera 
You can also add more than one view in bookmark 
So, let's see how we can do it 
time 
So, now, we have a basic model and for a time, I will just Off this and after that, we'll
that is IBL 
just put some amount of surface shaders and we'll start doing mental ray physical sun
and sky 
So, at first what we will have to do, just go to render settings 
Here you have the render using Maya software 
We will change this to mental ray but as you can see, we are not finding the mental ray
over here, because there are different <?>render engine</?> 
So, what we will do, I will just off this and after that, we'll go to Window and here
you have the setting and preferences 
So, in setting and preferences you have plugin manager 
So, if you click this, a dialog box will open, it will show all the plugins which is situated
And also, we will learn how we can use the physical sun and sky in Maya application 
in the Maya 
If this is checked, that means it has been loaded or if this is not, that means it will
not loaded in Maya, so you can load it according to your need  So,
the auto load is that whenever you just close your Maya, after that when you open
it, if you check the Auto Load, then it will finally come 
And if you don't check this Auto Load, that means you have to just click one by one again
and again if you are opening your Maya 
So, now if you go down, and here you find a option called Maya to MR dot bundle 
So, this is basically mental ray 
As you have to just loaded it and auto loaded it 
The IBL and the physical sun and sky help you to generate the photorealistic
So, we have checked both of them, that means it will load into your Viewport and it will
also have a particular panel and whenever you close your Maya and reopen it, it will
show  Okay 
Here we have just click both of them 
Now, what I will do, I will just simply close it 
Now, if you go to render settings, here you found a particular pre-set named ‘Mental Ray’ 
So,
as you can see, there are only two tab and if I go to mental ray, then it will increase 
So, like this way, you can just put your mental ray and just open through window and setting
in preferences and plugin manager 
scene  Whatever you if you want to render any scene <?>0:42</?> scene in daylight or in sunlight,
So now what we can do, we'll just go to Indirect Lighting 
So, we'll see these settings laterwards 
At first, we have to just put the physical sun and sky which is present inside Indirect
Lighting 
So, in Indirect Lighting you have Environment tab and in Environment tab you have two option,
Image Based Lighting, which we have discussed earlier and this is the physical sun and sky 
So, if you go to create, now it created the physical sun and sky 
So, I will close it and if you render the same data, what you will find that you will
find it is as you can see, this small tiles like thing is due to the Final Gather which
has been checked and we will discuss this Final Gather laterwards 
you can easily go to the physical sun and sky option in Maya application 
Now, you can see it’s casting your light  So,
if your physical sun and sky will be off, then it will not show this amount of light
on your model  So,
what we will do, we'll just close it and we'll go to Render settings 
If you delete this, what happens?
See, if I just rendered the same data and you will found that the light is not present
and your screen 
That’s why it is quite dull 
So, that means you have to just apply the physical sun and sky and the scene is totally
changed 
And in IBL, when you are working into the CG object, and if you require to generate
One more thing 
At first, whenever you are doing your render for testing purpose, you should be rendered
in a very low quality 
As you can see here, you can have this size and also you have the rendered time 
So, the size is around nine sixty and five forty 
What I will do, I will just go to render settings which we have already opened it and I will
go to Common tab 
In Common tab, if you go down, here find the pre-set which is HD five forty 
So, because, we are using Test Render, so, I will go to minimum which is three twenty
and two forty 
some bounciness of the common environment, that should be reflected onto the model 
Just for examine purpose, if I'm satisfied with my result, then I will increase it to
4K, which is four times HD or even I should go to nineteen twenty, ten eighty P 
So, this which is around here, nineteen twenty, ten eighty P  But for testing purpose, I will
image format would be <?>IFF</?> 
So, <?>IFF</?> were working, you can work in <?>IFF</?> or you can also work in EXR 
And for render purpose, only for checking your result, I will go to JPEG or even PNG,
okay but final output will be rendered in EXR or even in TIFF or Targa 
So, now, we are in JPEG and compression quality is zero 
If you increase this definitely your time will increase, your render time will increase 
Such kind of effect we can generate with the help of IBL or the image-based lighting 
As you can see, our render has done 
At first, let's have a Test Render 
As you can see, we have just used only one light 
So, it's producing quite well because the shadows are smooth and also it's bouncing
some amount of light from the back 
And also, from here and the front part, which is lighter dark in colour and the extruded
part this particular section is getting bounced with the light 
So, I will go to settings 
At first, when you go to indirect lighting and here you have the
Final Gathering which is Accuracy, which is hundred 
Now, you have two views, which is view one, as we have set it earlier and the another
Okay fine 
You go to Common tab and here you have the pre-set 
So, I will just increase the, we said around seven twenty-five which is half HD 
Okay, fine 
Now what we will do is just select the slide, we'll go to the MIA Physical Sky one 
So, we have the multiplier which is five 
Or this is this part three twenty-two forty 
We have a test render 
Let's look at the exposure value of the light 
one is view two 
Select this part and just move a little bit like here, and a have a look 
So, we have just settled this thing and one more thing we have to do 
As you can go to Bookmark one, this part needs to be filled 
So, I just want to do one more thing, we'll select this particular section, especially
this part 
And when you selected if I press control, it will deselect 
If you have selected anything by drag, it will select the other parts by holding Control
Now, just put it over here and we'll go to bookmark view one 
And let's have a look 
So, you can switch accordingly 
Just put in a little bit like this 
So, because we don't have to focus in the crown part, as you can see it's floating on
the surface 
Okay, fine 
We don't have to put some model over here because it's not looking 
So, it's only for having a good knowledge for you so that you can work in your model 
So just for that thing, I just put the model at the top and exporting, there is no nothing inside 
You can just make some models here 
So, it's not showing in the viewport 
Let's have a look at this section 
It's fine, quite fine 
we'll select this slide 
We'll go to Attribute Editor and here you have the MIA Physical Sky 
Let's increase it by one only 
So, I put one and have a test render again 
Because if you are satisfied with the work, just do some test render, that would be better 
And after that when you're done with it, we can just finalize it 
So, as you can see what we have to do, I just Off this 
So, as you can see, we model is looking quite well 
We will select this will rotate this little bit, here and let's have a look 
Hope you understand the same 
Let's meet to the next session 
We haven't used any texture which is by default present in Maya 
We have just used it which is Lambert and also the light is also bouncing, a good amount of light 
See, we have the soft shadow and we have just used only one light 
You, have to use more than one 
You have to just examine the parts 
And here we have the size and the render time 
If you are getting darker area, you can use any light over here 
So, I will left this thing to you 
So, you can add extra lights 
Now you have the idea about both which is image-based lighting or the physical sun and
sky, which are both come under Mental Ray 
So now, one more thing is that, if you want to do some tweaking, you can go by selecting
this part and you have this 
You can increase the multiplier as you can, as you want to increase this work light intensity
which is one, if you increase by twenty, what happens?
Let's have a look 
So, we are using Mental Ray 
As this is the previous image  So,
now you can see your images getting burned 
So, increasing the multiplier will affect your scene, especially see your image gets
burned, fully burned 
So, don't use multiplier too much 
If you are in one make sure that you will increase or decrease 
If you are decreasing then you should at least take zero point five, zero point three, or
zero point eight according to your need 
Or if you're increasing, you can use one point five two or even one point eight, two point
two like this 
So, by increasing so much it will burn up your whole scene 
So we’ll not increase this amount 
And as you can see, your whole image gets burned 
We have to just make sure that you will decrease the value of multiplier 
By default, it is one point zero 
So, I will just off this and I will just put, let's see zero point five that means zero
point fifty 
And have a look at this particular section 
This is the previous file which we have rendered, and now if you are using zero point five,
what happens?
and just change it like somehow like this change 
See, the part the particular section is getting dull, and also there are small you can see
the details which gets extracted from light and you have this soft shadow which we have
worked in Attribute Editor inside Mental Ray physical sun 
And inside that, you have physical sun and, we have just done the shadow softness and
also the increase the sample 
So, like this way, you can add your light and also you can add extra multiple lights 
And whatever you are making, you should have put particular texture 
So, it would look fine and always use soft light and soft glowness that will just add
so much of detail to your particular scene 
And it looks a little bit of, you can see real also 
So now what we will do will increase the multiplier as by default which is one point zero 
And also, we do some more tweaking inside the Render Settings and inside the MIA Physical
Now, we will just quick apply some surface shaders in this module 
And let's examine as you see that we have created this light and what we'll do?
Just select the parts, all of them in this part, right click Assign new material and,
we'll use the I think, we use the Lambert only 
And also, we'll go to colour and we'll put some amount of yellow colour like this 
We go to View and here you have the bookmark and just go to Edit bookmark and here you
blend and we will increase the colour 
that we can select multiple, right click assign new material 
So, we are using Lambert here and now we change the colour 
So, we'll apply in this also 
So, at first, I will go to File and here you have the Save scene 
So, I will make a new version 
Select the last part 
We edit this underscore zero zero three 
As you can see, our file type is Maya binary 
have the, G and name it view, view two or you can name according to your
So, we will just put on save and continue 
Now, we will just put some texture over here also 
We will Select the file by holding Shift button and right click Assign new material, lambert
and we’ll change the colour of the lambert 
So, we need some amount of shininess 
Assign new material 
We will change the colour 
comfort  So, add to shelf after that apply 
Not this plane 
Go to set limit area, so input Lambert only, select this part also 
Now, we will choose this part, and also this particular section 
Select all the parts one by one 
Now we go to assign new material and we will change the colour as you can see, we have
put the same colour 
So you can change it and right click object mode 
So, we'll go to View, and here you have the bookmark Control S to save the file and now
have a Test Render 
So, we have to increase the exposure value of physical sun and sky 
Just close it 
Hello everyone, welcome back to the class 
So, with the help of mental ray, you can use how you can generate the caustics, when the
light bounce through any kind of class, or the extra refractive surface 
Now, let’s switch to the Maya application and have look how we can generate the caustics
in Maya application, with several Mental Ray parameters 
Hello everyone, so today in this session we will learn about how you can generate the
caustics inside Maya application, so, let’s gets started 
As you can see I have selected two models and I have applied a simple texture with the
surface, and also I have increased the transparency value 
So, now as you can see it’s getting quite reflected into the surrounding and also it
has some short of shininess 
So, in this class we will learn about the generating caustics and the lighting with
So, I will cut this for a while, and I have just stated some basic parameters for caustics preparation 
I have this thing and also I have two different objects which is just front of it 
So, I have a ground and also a light which is just focusing in it 
So, I will just go to the assign existing material or even I can go to the this particular material 
So, I will just go to the render and click over here and have a render view 
So, as can see the render view is quite happening and also we have some sort of bounciness over here 
And we have this panel which is Phong, and also we have the colour 
So, I will click on the colour and here you found a panel, and will just go to file and
just go to the file pad 
third party render engine 
And in image name you have the texture, so I will just put a normal texture 
And as you can see will go to place 2D texture and will repeat the UV 
So, I think I should use fifty and also I should use fifty, so now its getting tiled,
and also you can increase the this value as according to your need 
If you need to increase more value, you can also just increase the value, and also you
have to just think about, if this looking good or not 
Otherwise, you have to just open the
UV editor  So, right now I am just making a test render, so hope it look good into your screen 
As you can see It’s taking some time because as we are in mental ray panel 
So, definitely it goanna take some time, if you are switching from Maya software to Mental Ray 
Third party render engine means indirect lighting illumination render engine 
Its time will be increased because definitely Mental Ray is heavier as compared to the Maya software 
So, the render is quite good, and I will cut these off for a while, and will select this light 
This is a point light or a spot light, you can say spot light, you can change the light from here 
And we are in Mental Ray tab, and in mental ray tab you have also caustics and global
illumination, which is by default off 
So, click on emit photons and the photons is on and also just check the render view,
and also you can find that the render is happening quite slow 
You have to just click on the snapshot and take this snapshot and just re-render it 
If you want to do a quick comparison, you can take this snapshot 
For example, you can use the mental ray as well as you can use the Arnold render also 
Now, I will go to outliner and here we have the point light, and also we have to adjust
the point ray somehow here 
Because I have to generate the caustics, it’s also affecting on your viewport 
And if you press seven, definitely you can see the light and all the things 
But, I think I can do it in six by pressing six or five, even because I don’t need to
just increase the capacity of my viewport 
Because if these things happened, definitely it will take some time or otherwise your system
get hang up 
So, I will increase the intensity by zero point five, decrease the intensity a quick
comparison into a particular
In future whenever you are going to work in with the production of pipeline, you may have
frame  I have selected only this part and looking quite good as compared to the previous one 
So, I will close this thing off, and also will select this light and use the Photon
intensity little bit of it 
quite in a good manner 
So, just go to render settings and in quality and have the indirect illumination lighting,
so, will generate the caustics clicking over here 
As you can click all the panels will be highlighted, because at first its get off and now you can
have the caustics photon, which is off in this panel 
one more application called the Vray also 
And if you just click on here, you will find that it will not change, definitely it will
not work with it 
Because we have to own these caustics and after that what else we have to do, let’s
have a look 
Will just click over here, select the light and just i think we have to just increase
The caustics is generating quite well into the crown, and also you can increase it according
to your need 
Because now you can have the idea that how you can just increase the caustics, and by
simple tweaking some of the parameters you can do it well 
But, here because it’s a fundamental or you can say the intermediate sessions of the
And you can increase this photon intensity accordingly, if you need to increase definitely you can 
And I will just cut this off for a while and take a sneak, a snapshot, and for having extra
things you have to just quick comparison between them 
Because comparison is very very useful, and I just put it Lambert only in this crown 
And just click over here and just click over here for a touch render view, for having a
good render result 
Let’s see what happens inside the Lambert 
As you can see, it’s reflecting definitely as the ground part is quite brighter as compared to the
previous, and also the light which is bouncing here is glowing quite well 
So, with the help of this you will have good idea that how you can change the panel, and
animation, so here we will learn about one of the render engine in between the same that
how you can tweak between the panels for the caustics 
Please click over here and just render it according to your need 
Now, this time I have just increase the size of the render, it’s rendering quite well 
And also you have to save the file for a good result view, so, I will just save the file 
So, now hope you have the idea how you can generate the caustics inside Maya application 
So, let’s switch to the next session 
is the mental ray 
﻿Hello everyone, welcome back to the class  So, in  this stage of production pipeline will learn about  
And will select the top part and will delete the  same, and I will go to edge and will double click   
And will select whole loop and will go to mesh,  edit mesh, and here you have the extrude   
Click, press W and will move further, now  what I will do now? I will go to extrude again  
and by holding R button  I will scale  it down little bit will move further,  
and after that what I will do  I will go to  mesh and here I have the panel fill hole,  
so it will hole the cap  And now I will  delete this part and will delete the same,  
will delete this part also  Because I don’t  need I think we don't need this segment here,  
object mode  And here I have the base, so  we have to give some amount of thickness   
At first I will just off the grid  
the rigging in Maya application  Hello everyone  in this session we will model a particular lamp,  
insert this down a little bit, and  edit mesh, extrude again at the top   
No worry, we will change it laterwards, we will  go to front press six or five or six  Because we  
are not in texturing mode and will just drag this  thing like here, and will drag like this    
what I will do now? I will just right click,  
assign new material like this, we will assign  a particular material from here  But, at first  
I have to complete the whole model, then I will  assign the material  I will use Phong E or Phong  
because these have luster and shininess followed  by glossiness in it  So, we will apply this  
one of them and will apply some sort of texture  also  So, I will now on my grid and the base has  
been made, and now what I will do  I will make it  a stick part, so only we will just drag this box,  
which is an inorganic model  And we will work  on its bone structure, that means we will rig  
and we will duplicate again control D  And what  I will do? I will select both of them, and just  
have a look that it will alive or not or not  It  can work, so I when go to top view, will select  
this part and will move here  Select this part  will move here, and we will select both of them,  
go to mesh and here you have the combine  So,  now both of them are combined with each other   
So, for rigging what I will do, at  first select each and every part and  
go to modify  Here you have the center pivot,  so it will align this pivot to the center   
Now, we will add a light, this would be the  light, so will add somehow over here  
that is fine will increase its size   
the same, so let’s continue  For modeling, I  will go to polygon and after that I will go to  
If you have problem with this axis, then you can  press your plus key to enlarge it, or you can  
thing like here, and will put it over here  Will put take this and will shift it over here,  
somehow here, and now what I will do  I will  just rotate each and every part one by one,  
make sure that you are saving your  file  So, I will make a new folder, the  
one, so you have to make the version which  we already discussed earlier  And now  
so for animation what I will do, if you press  insert button  You can change its pivot,  
so I will put pivot over here, and will  select this and will put pivot over here   
polygon tab here  At first we will change  this to polygon, so I will simply make a model  
You can have modification like this, so  
I have a rotation like this and have a rotation  like this  So, now our model has been completed,  
and what we will do, we will just select all the  parts  And will go to assign a material and here  
we have the Phong, and what I will do now? I will  go to attribute editor  Here you have the Phong  
and you should go to colour, and I will just pick  the lightest colour  And now I will just select  
this part only, will put assign new material   Another Phong and we will put some amount of  
like this  So, you have a design  
And, and now I will just select this part, will  go to assign new material  I will put Blinn  
Now, will save the file and will start working on  rigging, so before rigging
of lamp  So, what will, I will do now? I will  just drag a cone and will press five button   
what I will do  I will just select all the part and go to edit  Here you  have delete by type history, so it will erase up  
it history  History will be deleted and after that  will align in the center, if you look that you’re  
all the panels is changed  So, what I will do, I will do now  
just select the part and here you have freeze  transform  What it will do? It will just  
take all the coordinate system and will put zero   Freeze transformation, now you can see all the parts is zero,  
only the scale value is one  So, we have  turned the freeze transformation, and we have  
cleaned the history also  So, you can’t found any  history, only three things is there, the texture,  
its property feature and its attribute editor   So, only this amount is have, because we have  
just deleted the history, and we have just  used the freeze transformation so…
And here if I go to a channel box layer editor,  then I have inputs panel which is polygon one   
And I will give the cap segment around two,  and what I will do now  I will go to height,  
I think we need height at least two, two is fine, and we  don’t need this amount of subdivision axis    
So, we will make it as twelve, so as you can see, we just found this  thing, and what I will do now? I will go to face   
﻿In module number nineteen we will learn about  introduction to bone setup and the joint setup  
bones  Now what I will doing, I will not go to  this view, I will just go to left or front   
So let's focus in this view and now I will go to  animation and after that we'll go to skeleton   
Here you have the joint tool, if I click  here, now I will make the bones, click, click, 
click, click and  click, enter  As you can see  
we have just made this bone for the feet and this  is for the knee, this part basically for shoe   
So if I press six, our bone will be lost because  it's inside the model  So, what we have to do,  
we will go to shading and we have  X-ray joints  Now you can see properly,  
the joint is showing or you  can also click over here,  
click X-ray joints  Now you can easily touch up  your joints and we have to modify it  If I press  
insert now we can modify it because modifications  is very important  This things will be lied here  
in Maya  So, easily you can rig the character  and here we will also learn what kind of things  
and this will go upward little bit  of it and we'll press insert again   
So now, we will go to the front view   What I will do just now pressing sticks  
and will select the bone and will move here   
So, little bit of adjustment we require  So,  we will adjust in perspective, X-ray joints  
or you can also do it by shading, here you have  the X-ray joints panel  So I think this part  
Now  we have to focus on the spline, so  for spline again go to joint tool and  
as you can see here this is the parent bone,  because we have made it and we have just started  
from here and it will just follow the bone  So, if you can select here, this are the children,  
this are the children, and this is the parent   So make sure that whenever you make this spline  
we should keep into the mind whenever we are going  to draw the joints or the bone in my application   
you will start from downward direction, because  we don't require from upward because we have to  
just make the pelvis as a parent bone  so I will click, click, click, click   
Okay we will make modifications later wards,  click and click  So, this is for head region,  
this is basically for the face, this is for neck,  this is for shoulder and this is the spline    
One thing you have noticed that this is being  curved because our spline is curved little bit of  
S- shaped, so we will just make this spline  also in S-shape so that would be better   
So now, I will press insert and will  adjust it like this way, will adjust it  
here and we'll just move here  We'll  select this part will move here,  
I think it's working quite well  and we'll press insert again    
Now, let's switch to the software and have look  how you can work onto the biped frigging here   
Now, it's in the centre   
Oh it's displaced, so no problem   Okay  Now, what we have here,  
we will just duplicate this bone later  wards we have to focus on the hand,  
make sure that you will make a new version  So,  I will go to save as, will make a new version,  
and now I will go to top we'll  press six button for shading view  
and I will just go to shading and X-ray joints  So now, I will focus on the hand  So,  
I will make the left part so for that  joint tool, click, click, click   
So, as you can see, we have made it  
Hi everyone, so, in this session we will  make the bone structure of this model   
and joint tool, click, click and click, enter  
click, click, I think two is fine  So, what  I will do now, I will just select this bone,  
go to channel box, we'll decrease it's  radius by zero point two  Same with this one,  
because if I decrease from  here, display animation and  
joint size, then what happens it will decrease  all of them, so I don't need that part   
So what I will do, I will decrease  by manually that would be better   
Okay, I will keep here and  
I kept the size of it like zero point  five, that it would be better for me, so  
no problem because we have to just select this  and we'll just move  I think we also have to click  
like zero point five  So, now it's okay  We'll  press the insert button and we'll move up over  
So, let's continue  Now, I have a model which  we have combined it in previous tutorial 
here, we'll press insert button again  Now, we will  just select the both of them and what we will do,  
we'll select this part and we'll do  the P  So, now it's been connected,  
Okay, if you press control space bar it will  maximize your view  So, I mean maximize mode   
Now, one more thing is that I  have to add one more bone to it   
That's going to joint tool, click and click   
Because it's a tedious work so you  need lot of patience to do the same   
That thing will move over here,  
Now, I have a clear look  Before getting into bone,  you should look at your model that each and  
and we'll press the insert again  We'll select  this part, we'll select this part P to parent it   
We'll select this part, we'll select this part  P to parent it  Now, if I press the pelvis bone,  
all the bone will be selected control Z   And now as you can see we had just made the  
bones you can do such sort of changes also  If  you increase the quantity of the bone that doesn't  
matter, but if you can arrange it well then it  would be fine  So it's very important to arrange  
the bone and one more thing is that this thing  need to be modified little, so what I will do  
instead of putting over here I will just put over  here and for this I will prefer to go to insert  
and will put over here somehow here,  and one more thing, you have to give the  
every your Poly will be aligned properly and you  should have a clean Poly, as you can see here it  
been connected, our bone has been connected and  in next session we will just mirror the same in  
this axis and we'll also work in the co-ordinate  system of it  So let's meet to the next session  
and make sure that you are saving your files so  again I will make a new version of it and will  
doesn't have any meshing and all, it has a clean  Poly, so you should have a clean Poly like this    
So, now I will just insert some bones, will  animate afterwards  So at first we'll add some  
Hi everyone 
We want in y and z, let's see, apply, it's added successfully 
If this is going up, definitely is going down 
So, this is a complete line 
So, this is the second axis, this is the first axis and this is the second axis with World
Local Normal 
So, z is the local normal, second axis y is the second and x is the first axis 
So, now, we have just made that thing and we have also renamed each and everything into
layer because we have layers 
And, in next session, we will just divide this part and we will just implement into bones 
This allow you to rename quite well, whatever you select it will show up here 
So, that means we will cut the body, make a new proxy and we will start working on the same 
So, we will just use this model only, for that particular one 
Hello everyone 
In this session, we will look at how we can generate the proxy model and how we can add
these bones in that particular proxy 
So, let's continue 
Before adding proxy, what I will do now, at first, we will select this thing and make
sure that it's all combined in a single model 
So, what I will do now?
I will press combine again 
So, this is the Outliner 
So, yeah, it's combined 
And now, what I will do?
I will select all the bones one by one, and I will go to Animate and here in Display,
we have transformed 
So, we will Off this particular section 
So, locate local rotation axis will be Off and so that we will see the bones clearly 
So, I will Off all the local axis, so we don't require now 
So, I will just select this part and we will move out 
Here also we needed some of the parts 
So, I think each and everything, has gone 
Adjust it here, we will adjust it by here 
Each and every axis, which we have created by Display and this Transform Display 
So, now what we will do?
We will just select this particular model and this particular one 
At first make a new version and then we will duplicate the same Control D  So, this is
the main girl model 
And what I will do now?
I will just select the main model and I will put in another layer and we will add the selected
object here and we will hide the same 
This is the proxy 
We will just divide the parts one by one 
Now, as you can see, this is the main girl model 
So, I will select this part and will hide the bone and as a reference I will keep the bone 
So, I will select this part and now if there is a bone, then I will remove this part and
will extract the same 
If there is a bone, so I will remove this whole part 
Like this, I will work 
So, we will go to Polygon mode and what we will do now?
We will go to Mesh and here we have the extract 
So, let's continue 
Go to Face, select the Face here 
We have to just rotate and see if you're seeing in good way or not 
So, I will rename Girl, and enter 
So, like this we will select this file and we will do Contol H for hide 
panel and what we will do now?
We will go to Display and here we have Show All, and now we can see the hand  So,
now what I will do?
I will go to Animation and here I have the Skin or Constraint 
So, we will first use the Constraint 
So, here I have the Constraint panel as you can see here 
So, this is the model and this is the bone 
So, we will first use the Constraint 
We will On this thing 
We will select the Joint at first, after that shift select the shape and we will do the
Parent Constraint 
So, we will open the window and here I will just reset all the things will apply the same 
Now what happens, see?
It will animate it 
So, one by one we will do the same 
We’ll select the Polygon, Apply 
So, if you select it, you have numbers of couples of different things 
Now you can see if I rotated this our whole hand will rotated 
See, because it's simulating some sort of cut moments 
Like this, I will animate the whole body 
You can see here 
So, like this way, so what I will do now?
I will just make whole body part like this 
We will move this upward a little bit 
So, in next session, we will do some much more at adjustment and attachment and all 
After that we will sort out the mistake in part 
Just click it’s set of bone and this is the bottom one 
This one is the 
We will do the renaming process 
 Press Control G 
Now what happens?
You will create a new null  So,
in this particular null, I will just put all the things of the model 
So, select all the parts, especially this one and what I will do?
We’ll put in the null 
So, I just put in the null 
So, whatever I want to edit, I will just select this null and we’ll do the same because
each and every coordinate and each and every model is being displaced by its own coordinate 
That’s why it is showing like this 
So, let’s continue 
So, we don't have to worry about 
Think there are buttons also, transparent 
So, these are the bones 
These are the camera which you have seen, this one, this one, this one and this one 
So, it's all the views 
This is the group 
So, I will rename it called parts 
If you have made the bones, you have to rename it properly 
is kept over here 
So, make sure that you're saving your file 
So, now what I will do?
I will select one by one and we’ll rename it 
So, we have to go to Outliner again, and just select one by one 
Then select this bone and this bone has been selected and now this joint, so this is the
upper underscore body 
So, we have renamed each and every part you as can see here 
It is very important, because after that I will just mirror this bone to this side 
So, make sure that you are saving your file and now what we will do?
We will do the Mirror 
So, for Mirror we will use the mirror geometry and we will just flip this particular section
and the downward, this particular section over here 
So, we will just mirror this particular joint of the arm, and we will put over in the right
side also and of the leg also 
So, let's start, but at first what I will do?
I will go to channel works and here you find two layers, this one and this one 
So, we have to just put this model in one layer and we will have to put the joints into
another layer 
So, rename is very important 
So, I will just select the model and by holding Shift, you have to select the whole model 
And what I will do now?
I will just select this layer, right click will add selected objects 
Now the object has been selected, and we will apply it over here 
I will go to this part and we will add selected
objects  So, both of them have different layers and we will save the same 
If you change the colour, definitely it will change and it will show that particular colour here 
So, I will rename this 
Before renaming, what we have to do is just go to Edit 
And this is the girl 
So, rename is very important, as you can see 
R will allow you to just freeze that particular thing in that particular layer and T will
allow you to hide that thing 
So, R, this is off mode and this is T  So, like this way, now you can select the bone
because R is there, click you can select now, if you click over here, it's being Off 
That means it is transparent 
So, like this way you can work 
So, I will make a new layer and select this particular one, and right now I will just
hide this 
Here you have the Delete by type history 
Now, what we will do?
Go to Display, and here you have the Transform display 
So, I will just click this thing will move over here, local rotation axis 
So here, you can see all the axis is showing here 
Now each and every axis is showing 
Now, what we have to do?
So, it will erase a bit history and now we have a clear model with the bones 
I will just click, off this thing and we will select the pelvis region 
And in skeletal, I may have one more thing is that Orient Joint, click over here as you
secondary axis, which is this part and the secondary axis world orient this one or this one 
So, primary axis will always go up here and there, that means straight 
Secondary axis will go from top to bottom and secondary axis world orient will go from
this position to this position as you can see here 
So, I think we have to check the alignment because that's very important 
Just select this part and we will do the mirror 
So, make sure that you're saving your file 
So, what I will do now, I will go to just window, and here you have the Outliner 
﻿Hi everyone, as you have seen that we have  just formed the bones  Now in this tutorial,  
snap to the vertex, as you can see here  So, I will snap one by one, and I will just  
put some, you can say this controller at the bone   So, what I will do? At first, we will save a file   
as you can see, this has been thrown  out from the pelvis  Here you can see  
we’ll go to radius and will increase by three,  no sorry, not three, I think one is fine   
Control D, shift P, and we will select one by  one or I will just put the radius over here,  
I will make another bone  But, at first we have  to just make a new layer  This would be fine  And
this parts  
need to go up here, at  selected object point  Now, if I  
check this, all the things will be gone  As  you can see here, you have just hided it,  
that's why it's not showing here  We  will afterwards open that same   
we will make some much more modification  and we will add extra panels to the bone,  
So now, we will focus on our character and bone   So, what we will do now? We have just make new  
And what we will do? We will add selected  object and we will just give the colour,  
so that we can recognize easily  and we will rename this dummy bone   
Decrease its size zero point seven is fine,  I think  Yeah, it's looking quite well   
If I go to open my bone, let us see  Okay, it's not bad  So, I will select one by one  
zero point seven  Same with this  one  We’ll make a new part over here   
And we will take this part and  we will zero point seven  Fine,  
Control D  We will take  this part and move to here   
so that we can animate easily  So, let’s start   At first, I will go to Window and here you have  
We’ll take this part, Control D and move up to  
here Control D  So, you can see I'm  aligning the bones  Control D and  
So now what I will do? Select all  the bones at selected object    
Now, I will connect all the things one by one   So, let’s start  So now I will start parenting   
So, I will select this child and by shift  selecting will select this one and do the P,  
any of them  It doesn't matter whichever  you want to select, this one or this one   
I will then select this one and we will  select this one  Press P parent the same    
We’ll do it by here also  We’ll select this  one, and we’ll select this one, P parent the  
Outliner  So, if you see the Outliner these  all are cameras, the four views of the Maya   
same  And after that, we will select this one,  and this one and hit P will parent the same  And  
we’ll select this one and this one P will parent  the same  Now we have a complete set of bones   
We will just select the child bone  and we will go to skeleton and  
here we have the root skeleton  why I'm  doing this, I will tell you later wards    
And here is the root skeleton  What is the  benefit of it? As we are giving so much more  
controllers to the feet so that we will not  touch the bone and we will start working in it,  
we will just put so much of controller so that  we can easily touch that particular controller  
and will work for the same  So, like this way, I  just adding a few more things  So, there are a lot  
of more features for the bone  So, you can have  all the things, see you can do parenting* to see  
like this way   So, now what I will do,  
This is the bone where all the  bones are being kept over here,  
I will just hide this bone and we  will open this particular bone  And  
one more thing we have to do, we will just select  this part and we will use the IK which is Inverse  
Kinematics  As we have discussed earlier, that  if I go to skeleton and we produce a joint  
and as you can see this is a joint which is  irregular  I will just put it as front 
If I if I believed that this would be the  neck and this would be the spine   
So, if I just select this part and we will go  to skeleton and here you have IK handle tool   
So, if I click here, you just find two things-  which is Single Chain and Rotate Plane Solver   
Single chain will only allow you to move in any  particular direction but rotate plane solver will  
allow you to move plus rotate in any direct  pressure  I will go to single chain solver  
or rotate paint  It is much more  convenient, then I will touch this part  
and this is the girl model  And these  are the default lights  So, we have  
and will directly adapt to this part  So, as  you can see here, a new cross-legged structure  
has formed and inside it, there is a line  and there is a compass you can see here    
So, now you have the freedom to move your  bone like this way, so it's very convenient   
You can move your bone easily  Now, we  will take another example  Let us see   
Now, for rotation you have to rotate manually which  is very hectic  Okay, so what I will do? I will just  
go to skeleton and here I have the IK handle  tool  We will select this part and we will  
select this part and now, if you select, you  can easily rotate or you can easily move    
So, this is the feature of IK  We’ll delete the  same, with select the bone, we’ll delete this   
So, what I will do now? I will just select this  part, go to skeleton, IK handle will select  
aligned this Outliner and we have just  renamed each and every part  As you can see,  
this part and not connect to this one  We’ll  only connect to this one  Now we had our IK    
Now, you can see our feet is moving quite well  Now  as you can see that, we have just applied the IK   
We have a lot of connection and can work  easily  If I select this, it's very hard to  
move because we have to just follow the internal  feature of the bone  So, what I will do now?   
I will just select this part, and we will  go to skeleton  Again, we will have the IK   
Now I will connect this part to this part  And now  again, we’ll connect this part to this part   
So, with here also  Now after that when it  made, what I will do? Next, I will just  
hide our character, and we’ll open this bone   
Now, I have to just connect this IK to  the bone  So, we will start one by one   
We’ll select the IK which is a child  and we will connect to the bone B  We  
our parts are being connected with the  polygon and we have just divided it  So,  
and we will select the  internal part and select P    
We will select the internal part and we  will select the internal and hit on P   
all the bones one by one  As you can see,  the foot will move  So, Control V again,  
and here I have the nerves, you can also  use EP curve tool or pencil curve  So,  
I will use the nerve and we will make a  sphere  This would be the large controller and  
right click you have control vertex   So, I will just give a shape,  
object mode  So now what I will do? I will  select this bone, shift select this part  
it's behaving quite well  I will just grab  this part we will start from the feet and  
and P will parent the same  Now I will  test this and you can move easily   
As you can see, this can work  quite well  So, Control D,  
duplicate special, minus, apply  
close  We will select this file and we will  delete the same  Now we’ll apply over here,  
We had a bug here that's why it's happening,  but it doesn't happen on your system   
So, what else we have? We have a couples  of different things  As you can see here,  
we have this thing hand and all  We have this  part also  So, one by one I will do the connection  
and for that, I will just go to top view  If, you  press V you can have vertex snap, I am snapping  
it  As you can see it align at the centre  If  you select anything if you press V so it will  
we will do Control D for duplicate  Now, as you can see, this part has been duplicated  
Hello everyone 
That means each and every hierarchy will be joined by itself and maximum influence will
be five, drop-up rate is four point zero is okay 
So, skin method is classic linear 
So, you can change from here 
But at first, I will just put over here, classic linear will be fine 
So, what else we have, so, I will use the apply 
After apply what happens?
I will close the same 
I will just off the colour 
Now, as you can see that each and every bone part is has its own colour 
We’ll go to corner strand and here you are the parent 
Why this happened?
Because now it has been applied to the model and if I just click over here, and if I want
to rotate, what happens?
See, now our model is moving 
But here we have the problem 
As you can see at the top, here we have the problem 
So, we have to sort out it one by one 
Here, it is fine 
But at some point, there is the problem 
If I want to rotate this what happens?
So, as you can see, now it is being connected 
See?
There isn't any problem, but at some position there is a problem 
You accept defeat, we’ll select this part 
And we’ll move 
Yeah, you can see it gets stitched 
So, there is a huge amount of problem in these shoes because the part is getting stitched
So, we have to sort out one by one, as you can see here, this getting stitched 
So, each and every bone* each and every joint has its own influence value 
So, what we’ll do now?
Right click, here you have a new panel paint skin weights tool 
We have connected this part in previous tutorial, as you have seen that this part is moving
This panel is new because we have applied this skin over the model 
So, here is the new panel, right click in skin weights tool by holding your right mouse button
you can go over there 
After that a brush will came, and a new panel will form right after your left size screen,
left screen 
So, now you can easily see which part is getting more affected 
So, like this way you can have hand, there are brushes 
These are the profile of the brushes, which you can say the pre-set of the brushes 
This is the smooth brush, gaustion* brush 
This is the little bit of harder but its corners are smooth 
quite well, as you can see here 
This is hard brush, this is square brush and this is the you can say, colour brush or even
the image brush 
So, this will allow you to import some file from outside 
This will allow you to add some textures also and then will only allow you to do the colour
or even you can add some texture internally 
So, this is the particular bone, if you select the pelvis, if you want to see the left leg
you can just focus like this 
So, as you can see here, if I zoom that particular part, just a little bit of more space 
White is the most effective part 
If it is going, lighter grey that means the part is getting fall off 
Now, one by one we will do the connection of all the parts 
So, if darker will happen in darker will happen that means it is the least effective 
If more bright will be happen, that means the part is more effective 
So white it is the most effective part and grey, lighter grey is most least, and after
that it will kill off into the model 
So, we have to just define the which part needs more, you can say weight 
So that each and every part will be fine 
And if I go to toe, here you find that this part is affected and the corner part, the
side shoe part is also there 
So, there is a problem we have to sort out it one by one 
As you can see, it is affected over here also 
So, one thing I have forgotten, I have to make the curve over here also and Control
So, if you roll down your brush it is rolling according to your model 
See, your brush thickness will roll according to your model 
There are two process, how you can maximize the size of the brush or minimize the size
of the brush 
Here is the small size, you can say 
If you want to minimize the brush, you can do it by here 
By pressing over there, your size will change and your pressure will change 
Your value will change over here 
If you need harder opacity techniques, the darker colour you will have hundred percent
which is by default one point zero 
D over here 
One is opacity, that means colour will be in full opacity 
And if you want to lighter, you can lighter 
This is the pressure of the brush, that means the tip of the brush where colour gets ejected 
So, it also depend on you 
So, you can change the value and for scale purpose, you should go to there 
So, if you press B button on your keyboard, and just use the left mouse button, you can
increase its diameter 
Yeah 
If you press the B button on your keyboard, if you want to increase or decrease, you should
press the left button on your mouse 
So, what I will do now, I will just off my model, and we’ll start snapping it, because
And by pressing, you can drag 
After that you can easily change the diameter or the radius of the brush like this 
So, as you can see, there are many more panel, we will discuss the main thing and you can
also examine one by one 
So, let us start and what we have we have to paint it according according to our need
and we’ll paint the same 
So, we’ll start from that particular point where it is, where we get the maximum thing 
So, we’ll see the pelvis region 
I think this is fine 
And hope you understand the same 
we need our pivot to be at the centre 
Let us meet to the next session 
So, we need the snapping, so I will just put the snapping over here that would be fine 
So, in this session we’ll start connecting this thing 
Press V and put this snapping over here 
Now you find that all the parts have been connected with each other 
We’ll put it somehow over here 
Now fine 
And we’ll off the model and this pivot will go to, somehow you can say, by press V, it
will just snap the pivot to over here 
So that would be better 
We move somehow here and just open the model and we’ll start doing the connection 
For connection, what I will do, make sure that I will make a new version and at first,
So, let us continue 
we’ll connect this part 
We’ll shift select with this part and we’ll press P  Now, this is the parent and this
is the child 
So, like this way you will connect one by one select this part, shift select this part
the part 
Sorry and we’ll select this part press P 
Now, if you select this part, if you want to rotate you can see it is sorted quite well 
Now, select this part and select this part P  Select this part and we’ll select this
part P  Select this part and we’ll select this part P  So, as you can see, whole of
What I will do now?
your model is moving 
We have to connect this part 
So, we’ll connect, we’ll select this part, press P  Now this part has been connected 
We’ll select the curve after that we’ll select the joint and there is a constraint panel 
So, I will just do the Orient, because we Need the rotation here 
So, I will just do the Orient 
Whenever you do the orient, you just click over here 
This fine orient constraint option and here you have to go to the reset setting and maintain
offset should be checked 
Now apply 
I will just select this part, press V for vertex snap and we’ll put up over here 
What happens?
See, it is following quite well 
Select and shift, select this point and we’ll do the click 
So, we can move, Shift select this and apply 
If it is turning into purple colour or pink colour, that means it has been applied 
So, the Select and can move easily, quite well 
Select, shift select this part, apply as I move 
All the part is moving 
Select shift, select this one, apply 
Shift select this one applied and the downward direction has been applied 
So, we’ll press V again 
So now you had a complete model 
As you can see it is moving quite well 
You can even rotate the same 
If you want to rotate, you can rotate quite well 
Now your rigging has been completed 
In next step we’ll just apply this rig to that particular model and we’ll also work
in space for facial connection and all 
So, let us meet to the next session 
Hi everyone and welcome to this session 
So, in this session we’ll do the skinning process and for that what we’ll do?
And now, we’ll do the Control D to duplicate it 
We’ll replace this model from that particular model 
So, let us replace 
So, as you can see that we have created the cutting distance and cutting corners 
Now, we’ll replace this model to the original model 
So, what we’ll do now?
So, in this layer, we have our model 
So, what I will do, I will just delete this model 
Most thing is done, just select all the controllers, and we’ll put over here 
Add selected object 
Now, we’ll only open that particular file 
We’ll put some over
I will just select it, and we’ll delete it 
And I will just put it over here 
So, as you can see, this model is being completed 
And now we’ll open the dummy, and we’ll open the bone structure 
So, at first, I will select the object and we’ll remove from a reference and we’ll
select the object 
And then by shift selecting, I will select the bone, the main pelvis bone 
And what we’ll do now we’ll go to animation 
And here I have this skin panel over here 
So, in skin there is a pattern skin 
So, here is a smooth bind 
Why smooth mind, because we don't want rigid bind, because that's an organic character
and the polygons are smooth here 
So, we need smooth bind 
If you have any inorganic character, especially robot car, bike, anything 
So we will do the rigid bind 
But here we need Smooth bind 
So rather than clicking over here, I will go over here and we’ll click over here and
here is the option panel 
So, there is a joint hierarchy, that is fine 
If we select the first circle, after then select the pelvis, what we’ll do?
So, now as you can see, I will just start from pelvis and this is the pelvis part 
And if the joint will be gone, and next joint will be found, there would be a gradient 
So, like this, where you can add your paint thing 
Animations_2831
Hello everyone  So, in this session, we will do some amount of fixation in this model 
As we have connected all the curves into the bone and we have also do the painting, weight
painting and all 
So, what else we have to do?
We have some problems here 
So, we will fix these problems, and we will look at our model 
I think rest is fine 
So, that is completely unnatural 
I think rest is fine 
So, we will just select this part and we will move a little bit here 
And we have done the weight painting, which is the vertex paint and we have just connected
all the parts 
So, to select the bone, what else we have to do?
We will go to the Channel Box and make sure that the bone is not being locked and we will
Off the Channel Box 
Now, we will select the bone only 
Select this part, press W and if you press insert button on your keyboard, you can shift
this bone in the downward direction okay by pressing insert 
So, what we have to do?
Press again 
As you can see, we have just shifted the bone 
I will just shift this bone also, by pressing insert and we will shift this bone same with
this one 
downward, that would be fine 
And so, now our problem has been sorted out 
And, let us see this hand also 
No problem 
In the corner part that means after the joints gets over, the part should be lighter grey 
And rest of the problem is being sort outed 
okay 
As you see the rest of this is going upwards a little bit so I will just do it 
Select the bone, press insert and just move it a little bit 
So, now as you can see, we have just fixed the part after that what you have to do just
press insert again 
So, you have just seen all the parts has been done 
So now, the character has been rigged properly and each and every part is fine 
And also, we have all the parts which gets connected to each other 
So, in next session we will learn about the Blend shape 
That means, it being partially lighter grey that would be okay 
So, let's switch to the next session 
For lighter grey, you have to just press the shift button and just paint like this and
In some shot also, if you're animating the character, if it's not fitting in this shot
you have to just paint in that particular shot also 
So, it's required a huge amount of time and patience also 
So, after that, the complete work will be happened 
So, I have to paint this area and will decrease this area 
Now we have our feet, so what I will do is press control and we will just off all the
Select the upper part, upper body 
I will go to upper body and here is the bone 
After that, we will just put the control button and we will paint because we had a bone here
and we need softness 
And it’s part is going upward, so we don't need that 
For decrease if you hold control, then you can decrease easily 
It is working quite well, as you can see 
And so, you have to define that particular area and I will just press Control and just
Let's check, deselect this part 
So, we have a little bit of space 
A little bit of whiteness, let's check at first is it working or not?
So now, you have the idea that if there is the joint that means here is the joint, you
Black is the least attractive part and if there is a pure black, that means this part
have to just paint here also 
And you can see your vertex is adjusting, and after the twenty joints gets over, what
you have to do?
Just press Shift and just paint the gradient part and this part you don't need it 
So, you will press control and just paint this black 
Now, you have the better idea about each and everything 
And you will just do it by yourself 
If you can do, then you may have the practice and you can follow one by one 
So, like this way, see this is the bone so this part needs to be affected, not this part 
So, what I'm doing?
has been deactivate over here 
I'm just pressing my Control button and just painting back, because I don't need this part
to be affected 
So it needs a lot of time and patience also, and then it will apply the same 
Hello everyone 
In this tutorial we will learn more about vertex paint 
So let's continue 
As we have just selected this part and see it is been sorted out, because we had the
problem over here and it has also been sorted out, as you can see 
Ok if you select any of the control point, or if you go to Paint, weight, here you have
the option called Use colour Ram 
If there is a light grey colour, then that means, there is a small influence 
Here you can see that it is applying or not 
The red is the most effective, orange is the least and after that it will fall, blue the
very least effective and after that it will kill 
So, it's very important that you should check from here also 
And if you want to edit a particular part, see if I go to pelvis 
If you want to edit the pelvis then you have to also edit in the supporting edges 
As you can see here, this is the edge, but it's also affecting over here 
So, what we will do now?
There is the value 
If you increase the value by one, then you have to press Control, then it will erase
In the joints, there would be the part with which will be white and after that when the
the same, but if you decrease the value, then you have to leave the control 
So, if you press the Control, it will repaint 
So, by increasing the value, you have to press control and by decreasing the value you have
to leave the control 
So, like this way you can paint 
So, we have just painted the whole model and now each and everything is fine in this model 
So, you had a better idea that how you can just paint the same 
If I select this part, what we are getting, see if I select this part, we have just painted
very precisely 
Now, you have the idea that how you can paint 
joint gets over, the part should have a little bit of gradient look 
Each and every part is rotated quite well 
By select this area, it's rotated quite well 
See, each and every part is fine now 
So, now we will move to morphing and we will discuss more about morphing 
By select this part, it doesn't have any problem as you can see 
So, each and every part is fine here 
So, now we will move to morphing and for that, one more thing is that whenever joint you
want to paint, see if this joint you want to paint, go to paint tool and just select
that particular joint 
How you can select?
That means, if you just apply harder white colour, then it will produce the brick type
Just go to like this 
If you want to paint this joint, see what happens 
Sometimes by default paint would be fine because we have just leave this part, because it is
quite well 
If you want to paint just click by control because we have just off the value, so by
control pressing, you can paint easily 
So, we may repaint it and this part is fine 
After that, by shift pressing, you can call up the same 
So, it's very important that you should press the Control and Shift by following up, if
there is the joint then white part will be there 
of look 
﻿Hi everyone  So, in this tutorial we  will make a simple dynamics inside Maya  
So, will load this, will load all of them, will  auto load it, so we will work on bifrost    
So, I just loaded all the things from and will  check any other thing is missing or not   
I think these are fine, so will do the refresh,  
bifrost which all are come over here   So, we will do in nearby tutorials,  
so this is the basic tutorial  What  I will do I just select the car,  
press control G, so it grouped successfully,  so its group now and what we will we do  
we will just rotate it, let’s rotate  So,  for rotating I will press V for vertex nap  
application  So, we will work on dynamics and what  we will do now, we have just edited this car, and  
so leave it, we’ll group it again  And what we will do now we will just  
let’s see if it is selected or not, control Z   
Its fine, will select the mudguard also,  
by holding shift  
and now what I will do make sure that  you are in polygon  And you will go to  
mesh and here you have the combine  So,  now it’s all the things has been combined  
and as you can see all the parts has  been combined  So, will select the part  
and will go to modify and here you have the  center pivot  Now, each and every pivot will  
be aligned to its center as you can see  So, in this tutorial we mainly focus on  
what we have get  We have just edited this  car and we will break a pillar inside Maya  
the dynamics purposes, so now it’s completed   And one more thing I will just select  
again, and go to mesh and will combined it  again because we just leave the tyre  And  
after get combined, what I will do make sure  that you are in polygon panel, so I will just  
grab a cube and will make a ground  like this  This would be fine,  
will make a ground and will decrease its size   
Make sure that you will manage in any  other view, so I will manage here,  
so, will put the car over here  We have just make  the car in a tilted manner, so no problem   
and at first what I will do I will animate  the car, so for animation I need at least  
application  So, before going I will go to polygon  and after that what I am getting here  I will just  
two hundred frames  So, you  can <?>take</?> over here,  
enter, now your timeline is  changed to two hundred frames   
At first what I will do I just press S button  on your keyboard, as you can see the timeline  
is getting red and all the values of yours is  getting red  And now, what I will do I will go to  
No worry, if this is going out  of grid, no worry about it    
So, you can also hide your grid from here, we will  hide for a time, now, this would be our you can  
say glass and this would be our ground  So, I  will just right click hold my right click button  
and I will go to assign new material, and here we  have the Lambert  And if after getting Lambert,  
go to render setting and here I will go to Maya  software  It is fine and will cut the same   
here you have the panel, I will go to Lambert  and will change the colour somehow to brown,  
I think it is quite good and will select this  part, and will put assign new material   
I will put blinn because blinn is like  have shininess, luster and glossiness,  
and sorry  
and will increase the transparent level   
Now, you can see from here I will select this  wall, and what we will do we will go to mesh tool,  
this is fine   
And what we will do now will select this, right  click go to edge, will select the whole edge and  
So, before going to the same what I will do  I will just go to window and here we have  
detach  Now, each and everything is been detach  
as you can go to face, as you can see that  each and everything is been detach properly   
Now, object mode, will select this  file and will go to nDynamics,  
so here you have all the things which you needed   So, I will select this box and will go to n mesh   
Make sure that you are in nDynamic panel, and  will go to n mesh, and here you have the Create  
nCloth  So, whenever you create any modifier from  nDynamics, it will create a nucleus as you can see  
here  This is a nucleus, this is a control  point and you can work with the nucleus   
So, I will just select this part, go to n mesh  and will use the passive collider, because it  
will collide with the wall  So, create passive  collider and this is also be the passive collider,  
so we have another nucleus as you can see here   So, this is the rigid body, this is the cloth,  
the setting and preferences  And here we  have the plug-in manager, will go to here,  
I will go to nucleus of this particular section   We have just imported the cloth and we have just  
used the cloth over here, and will go to its  nucleus  Will go to object mode, will go to  
its nucleus, and here have a  couples of different things   
At first ground plane, check  the ground plane and after that  
there are many more thing, we will discuss one by  one  So, if I press forward button what happens?  
It will collapse at first,  the car haven’t be hitted,  
but still it is getting collapsed  As you can see  
its gets collapsed,  
the car haven't been hitted,  but still its gets collapsed   
So, what we will do we will go to  forward, I think car need to be,  
and here you find all the plug-in which are  deactivated or which are activated in Maya   
no problem, so select this file, go to  nucleus and here you have the gravity  If  
then only it will collide the same  So, as you can see if the car touch the surface  
then that particular area will collide, otherwise  it will not collide  So, like this way you can  
work, in sixty two frame it will be off and  as you can see it’s getting collide quite well  
and after that it will come to the surface   
So, now you have the idea and  if I press forward, if this will  
hit the surface, then only it will collide   And you have couples of different thing,  
will discuss one by one  So, it  will now collide the same and  
like this way you can work quite well, as you  can see here all the cracks is been formed  And  
So, what I will do here we have the obj export  dot bundle, so I will check the same and will  
So, now we will move further, will pause  this for a while, and we will move further 
auto load it  And in future, we will work in  bifrost in this particular session only 
﻿Hello everyone  So in this session, we will make  a silencer of a bike and will emit smoke from it   
And select this one also   
Move it here and now, will just go to vertex,  select this part, just synchronize the size  
That would be our silencer   And if I press three, it is going like this  So,  
what I will do, in mesh tool you found the insert  edge loop tool, so will insert some of the edges  
to avoid the smoothness  And if you  press three, that would be fine  So,  
you can also use your own model  I will adjust,  eject the smoke from here  So, now what I will do,  
will go to press one and put it somehow here   Now, in top, you have to go to the dynamics tab   
We are not using nucleus dynamics, we are using  dynamics  When you are going to dynamics tab, so  
in dynamics tab you have fluid effects  So I will  just go to fluid effects and here you have the  
So let’s continue  I will go to the front and will just drag a cylinder and we’ll just drag it    
Create 3D container with emitter  So, I need  the emitter  So, I will just click over here   
And now, as you can see, a new box has formed  with the emitter  So, I will just delete this once  
again and just go to the fluid effect and create  3D emitter  Now, I will just rotate this,  
as you can see, we are rotating in x direction   So, I will just minus ninety and just enter it   
Now, I will just move it here and just move  it here  So, you can see, am just moving  
here and just move it here  Now I will just  select the emitter and this particular part  
and will just put it somehow here   So, I will just put somehow here and  
so, I will select this and just move forward   No problem, we will keep it here and will just  
move it laterwards  So, now what I will do, as you can  see, we will just off the grid and just make this  
to three hundred  So, we will increase or decrease  it according to our need  Now, I will just select  
So, as you can see, this is a cylinder  So we’ll just  form a simple silencer and you can also use our  
the container, only the container  I will select  the container  I will go to the attribute editor  
and in attribute editor, if I just drag this, I  will have a little bit of space  So, by selecting  
the container, in the attribute editor, you  have fluid shape  Two is because, we have just  
deleted the first one and just make the another  one, that is why it is returning the two   
So, now we have the container properties   In container properties, which we have base  
resolution which is ten, so I will increase this  with forty  So, it will add some more details  
in your smoke  So now, what else we have to do   We will just reposition it later and after that  
we have the auto resize  So I will check the auto  resize  It will automatically resize the smoke  
and after that we have auto resize threshold,  so which is zero point ten, so we need so much  
more a decreased value, so I will  just put zero zero zero two  Okay   
model  So, how we can achieve it, let us see  I  will go to the channel box and here we have the  
Now, we have the density and in density, density  is basically inside the content
details  If you go to the content details, you found the density   So, panels have the sub panels and as you can see  
content details have all the things here  So,  as you can see, density, velocity, turbulence,  
temperature, fluid, colour, all the things  are situated in the content details   
Now, in content details, we have density, in  density we will just increase the buoyancy 
As you can see, if I just increase this,  the smoke is forming at the front  Okay,  
So, as you can see, the smoke is going at the  front, so I will just increase the buoyancy by  
little bit  Okay, fine and dissipation,  will just increase this little bit,  
not so high  This would be fine and diffusion,  so it will add some random movement into it and  
add some random jiggleness also  So, okay, I will  just off this and in one more thing we have to do   
input  So, go to poly-cylinder one, we’ll decrease  the axis by eight  And we need cap which is two,  
So, if you need the bounding box, you can  just go to the bounding draw and you can just  
off it and on it as you required  So, if you just  go to none, it will just hide but I need it,  
so I will just put it here  Okay  So, now what else we have required   
Just off this all   
If you found this sub panels, it will just  highlight in this colour, darker colour and  
click and here you found this  particular sub panels, which is  
all came inside  So, will go to the density  and in density we have the diffusion   
So, as we have increased this, now as you can see, if I  go to front and just go, so I need some much more  
And after that, we have the, so  I will just increase this more,  
and height we need at least three  So now,  as you can see, we go to face, our soft  
as you can see, it is affecting quite well  So, now we have velocity  This is basically for  
speed and all  So, we have swirl  So, it will just  add some random movement also and just put it like  
this and just have a look  As you can see, it is  just forming some swirl effect  If we increase the  
volume, what happens  Let us have a check  If  I increase the value by ten, see what happens   
As you can see, it is  forming the smoke quite well   
So, I will just decrease this by four and will  move here and just have a look  So, like this way,  
you can increase the size of the smoke  and also you have to just experiment  
over the panel one by one, you can have  the idea because if you do the practice,  
you know the each and every process step by step  and after that you can do it quite well  Okay   
So now, we have the one more thing,  swirl we have done it and after that,  
selection is on, so press b to end this   By holding shift you can select the faces and  
will go to the one more thing, turbulence   In turbulence, we have strength   
So, will just increase this  little bit and let us have a look   
So, if you increase this what happens  See it  is just forming in this, if I decrease this,  
it will go  So I will increase this little bit   
And after that, okay, so now, after  having turbulence, you have strength  
and speed also  So, will  increase the speed, what happens?  
And now, I am going to shading  and here you have the panel, like  
all the things, so, if I just go forward  Now what  I will get, I will get all the detail features  
inside the shading tab  So, at first, if  you need to transparent, you can transparent  
quite well  Glow intensity, if you need  to glow, the intensity you can glow it   
will delete it and one more thing we have to do   Right click, go to edge, double click and now,  
Now, we’ll go to the colour tab and you can  select, click over here and just change the  
colour  Click and just click, and just change  the colour  So, I will change it to dark, black,  
especially the black and you can just click here  to just enlarge this particular view, just click  
you have the colour input, so I will just put x,  y, let us see  Okay, It is working quite well 
If you go to z, no, I will put just y and just  click this colour, like this you can flip   
Just flip this colour  Now, also just flip  this colour  So, you have a darker tone,  
which is forming, after that the reddish  tone  Like this way you can work quite well   
As you can see here and you have the input bias,  you can increase the input bias  So, as you can  
see, it is working quite well and also, the  temperature is glow, as if you need to just off  
press r to scale it  As you can see, scale  it, control z, sorry  So, we will just scale  And 
the colour and just put another colour, you can  do it well  You have the full freedom to do it   
One more thing we have to do  What else  we needed is to select these faces   
﻿So, we have just work in the colour and now will  off this all and will go to the content details,  
If you just go here, you can found the colour  which is producing is very darker  And also,  
you can just play with your colour as you can  go here, you just click somehow here, just click  
over here, just play with your colours  As you  can see, your colour is forming quite well    
black colour only, okay done  And we are in linear,  you can go to smooth and have the smooth result   
So, Like this way, one more thing I have to  discuss that if you are running into the timeline,  
then it produce some amount of jerkness  Make sure  that you will not run in the timeline like this,  
you will just play here and just  have a look at your smoke and all   
So, if you need the value of turbulence more,  you can just put the value of turbulence more   
And one more thing, if you need to animate this  you can do it well  You will go to the tab like  
you have the turbulence tab and in turbulence tab,  as you can see, we have worked for the same    
just select the container and what else we have to  do, will shift select the silencer and after that  
just go to the first frame and just go to  the particles you have to make colloidal   
So click as you can see,  it just formed the colloidal  
and if I select this, definitely  it will select the same  So, 
it’s working quite well  Make sure that  you will not just play in the timeline  
like this  Okay, Otherwise it just form the  jerkness and all  So, We do not require  
Okay, So, three or four things are main and  each and everything you can just experiment   
You have to work with  turbulence, lighting and colour,  
specially the content details which  is density, buoyancy, noise and all   
So, if I increase the frequency, what happens see   As you can see, it is working quite well  Also,  
Just click over here  Whatever you do, you just  do in a fluid shape  We have all the features,  
panels and here  You can do it one by one  as needed  So you can just put the values  
and just check is it working or not, is it fine  or not  okay, Let us meet to the next session 
your work cell is increasing  This is the work  cell  So, now as you can see, we have just  
make the smoke and if I just click here and  you just found the detail of the smoke   
You can also work in your colour if  you need to work in the colour  So,  
you have all the things like, you can work in  the colour and you can have smooth details, so,  
as I think you have understand quite well, so,  with the help of this few settings, you can just  
work in this particular ones  As you can see,  we have just transparent it very well  So, if I  
just decrease the transparent level, you can find  this small amount of smoke which is forming here   
﻿Hi everyone  So in this session, we will make a  rocket and will animate the thing and will produce  
and in emission speed attribute, here you have  speed method  So, I will speed method to replace   
After that we have all the values here  So, we  needed the directional speed  So I will increase  
this directional speed, I think one is fine  Let  us have a look  We’ll increase this laterwards   
Direction x I needed one  One is fine, okay one  is already there  And direction y, so after x,  
I need the y co-ordinates to be minus so that the  fume form in a zigzag motion, irregular shape   
So I will just put minus one or ten, I think ten  would be fine okay, and direction z will be zero    
So, we do not require direction z  So, in outliner, again I  will just select the fluid which is the container  
itself and will go to the attribute editor  So  in attribute editor, inside the fluid shape one,  
as you can see, there are many panels, but I  am working here in the fluid shape one  Okay    
So in fluid shape one, we have the dynamic  simulation  Here you found the dynamic  
So, now we do not require to go down because we will  not focusing in modeling and we are focusing  
simulation  So in dynamic simulation, as I play  this one, in from the first frame, as you can see,  
one more thing, is that we do not require the  gravity too much  So what I will do, I think,  
So we have the content details here  So,  I will increase this  As you can see,  
when I just open this, it has some sort  of sub-panels inside it, which is density,  
velocity, turbulence, temperature  We will work in density at first and in density we  
have the buoyancy  So will increase this buoyancy  little bit, fine  And here we have the noise  So,  
will increase this noise little bit, so will just  increase this a very little bit  I think  
twenty eight is fine  Now, we’ll go to the downward  and will have the velocity panel which is  
inside this particular only which is  content details  So, in velocity panel,  
mainly in dynamics  So, will not go to down and  just insert some edges here so that I may give a  
what else we needed, we needed is swirl   So, if I go to first frame in this,  
click, so I need some swirl effect  So, here we  have this swirl  So I will jut increase this   
I think one point sixty will be fine   We don’t require too much of swirl   
Again we have the noise inside the  velocity  So, we’ll increase this noise to,  
I think, fine  So, we have the turbulence,  which is again inside the content details    
So, in turbulence we have the strength   So I will increase the strength amount  
and increase this little bit, do not  require too much  So, first frame,  
okay  Now, what else we needed, we needed the  frequency, so will increase the frequency  
by three twenty and speed  Definitely  we have to work with the speed   
So, we will just increase little bit of it   
shape of the bottle and all  So, go to vertex  So, now I will change my view to the front  
Hope you understand the same  Let us  meet to the next session 
and I will just select this part and press  r button and just increase the size   
As you can see, we have increased the size and  also this one will increase and just   
Okay, now as you can see, we have just  make some sizes and also will just  
do one more thing is select the vertex and  just move upward and just select this one  
and just move upward  You press three, you  will found a kind of jar like object  Okay,  
Press one, so, as you can see, we will not  extrude this downward because we will focus on the  
dynamics, so here we have this one and required  is, you can say cone and after that will go to the  
some fumes with the help of this fluid inside  Maya two thousand eighteen  So, let us continue   
channel box and select the cone, will go to the  channel box and here you have the input panel   
So, I will just decrease the input panel,  I will just go to the input panel and  
will go to the polycone one and here  you have the sub-division axis, will  
give it twelve  Okay fine, so, no problem needed and  more thing we have to do  What else we have to do,  
right click, go to face, select this face and go  to the edit mesh and here you have the extrude   
So, I will extrude this in downward direction and  when it gets extruded will go to object mode,  
select this part, will move it here and do  one more thing, just select the face and  
will extrude this again little bit okay, and object  mode, will select this and just move it here    
And now, what else we have to do, insert edge loop  tool and just put some edges, edges is fine   
Just select this part and move a bit downward and now,  the main thing happens is that I will just select  
As you can see, we are in modeling tab and in  modeling tab, we will just click and draw a  
the two faces, three, okay three would be fine and  after that, will go to edit mesh, extrude the same  
in the outward direction and after  extrude, control z, will select  
four of them, I think four would be fine  Now, it is selecting the whole loop, so will go to  
extrude and after that will just  move it outward  Okay, So, now,  
I will select both of them, will do one  more extrude in the downward direction, so  
will make rocket like this  This is a  Diwali rocket and just move it here and  
will select this part, will move it here and just  increase the size, will move it at the top   
So, will select this and will extrude, you  can extrude it, well you have the freedom 
So, I will just extrude it like this  So now,  we select the vertex will move at the top   
As you can see we have made the rocket  and will just transparent it and just  
cylinder and will just move it over here and one  more thing, this cylinder would be the container  
move it here so that we have proper spacing   And also, we will just put this into  
this jar  Move it here and after  that what else we have to do,  
just isolate it, sorry, just transparent it,  just shift this little bit and just move it here   
As you can see, we have just move it and will just  transparented it and obviously we have to just  
give the support like this  What happens now? Well, be in one twenty frame, so  
will just rename this one twenty because we do  not require two hundred frames  Now will start  
animating  So, before animating make sure that this  button will checked because this is the auto key  
so you do not have to put by pressing s on the  timeline all the time because auto key is on  So,  
you do not have to put s button on the timeline   So, at first you have to just put only one time s,  
just lock its position, will go to the fifteen  frames and just move it here, control z sorry,  
where the, as you can say this the  bottle where the rocket will fly   
will move it here and just go to here  So, as you can see, it is getting out here  
so I will just move it somehow here  After  that will move it to twenty frame and just  
in thirty five, it just move here and just  rotated  Okay, so will just move it like this  
and after that, will move it here,  
quite detailed  Okay, I will go to  eighty five and just move it here   
So, put here select this by pressing  shift and just move it here   
You can after that in one twenty, it is just  gone to here and just rotated its position   
So, you have a complete set of animation  It is  a rough animation  You can do it quite fair  So  
this is for only example  So, I will do one  more thing  One more thing you have to do   
So, Right now, what I am doing, I will just go to  the edge and at first, will go to the mesh tool  
each and everything is fine and  
we have to work in the dynamics now   So, at first I will save my file    
I will go to the effects tab and after going  to effects tab, you have the fluids  In fluids,  
you have the 3D container  So, I will just  click the container  Now, as you can see, the  
control h, hide the same  This is the rocket, so  will select the shape and just rename this rocket   
So this is the rocket and so I have this small  small emitter, so I will just select this emitter,  
will delete the same  Now, you have the container  and also the ground  So, will put the ground here   
Okay, Now, what else we needed  I think I have  to just hide the ground also, control h   
and here we have the insert edge loop tool  So,  just insert some edges like this and just go to  
So, now will just put a simple sphere, click and  just make a sphere  This would be the emitter   
F, will click the F, so, delete the  face here, so I do not require the face   
Select the sphere and just move it somehow here   
Go to the transparent mode  Okay   
So now, as you can see, we have just putted the  sphere inside it  I will just put more inside it,  
so i will just put it somehow here  And  after that, what else we have to do,  
just press five and now, as you can see, we  will save the file, one more  And, okay   
So, I will select the container  and in the attribute editor,  
so you have fluid shape one  So fluid shape  one, in fluid shape one, you have the very much  
features  So I will go to auto resize and will  just click in the auto resize  So fumes which will  
face and just select the top and just delete it   Now we have a hole here and one more thing we have  
generate from it, it will automatically resize   And after that, what else we have to do, select  
the container and shift select the sphere  I will go to the fluid tab  Here we have the  
fluid tab and in fluid tab, here you have  the add/edit contents  Okay, So, in add edit  
contents you have the emit from object  As you  can see, here you have the emit from object   
So, what happens if I just click here, as you  can see, it is emitting from the object  We’ll  
pause this for a while, go to the first frame  and now, I will select the fluid container only  
and go to attribute editor in fluid shape  one  Here you have the container properties   
So, you have the base resolutions  So, I will  just increase this base resolution to around  
fifty two, okay fine  And now what else we needed  Will just go to the outliner  In window you have  
the outliner  So, I will go to the  outliner here and just drag this   
to do is just go to edge select all the edges  and this time I will go to the edit mesh  Okay,  
So, in the outliner, you have sphere,  which is this sphere and if you open this,  
you will found the fluid emitter one  So, I will  select this one, which is inside this sphere   
As we have link both of them and go to the  fluid and just add the add edit contents,  
so emit from object, so i will select this  fluid emitter one and what else we have to do,  
will go to the attribute editor and now  this time fluid emitter one, fine   
We have the base emitter attributes  Okay, So, we’ll  got to the base editor attributes, here you have  
the emitter type  So, I will change this emitter  type to omni  Now, what else we needed, will just  
go here only, base emitter attribute and we have  the rate percent  So, I will just increase the  
percent by one thousand so that we needed more  smoke and have some random animation in it  Okay   
Now, here you have the emission speed attributes   So I will just go to the emission speed attribute  
So, i will just extrude the same and will just go  to press r and just extrude it little bit 
﻿So, now what else we needed? We have the  textures  Okay, So, I will open the texture  
sub panels which is here; and we’ll select  this sphere  And will move it to here by  
middle mouse dragging, and just dropping  in it, just click here and just drop it   
Now, you can increase the  size of the voxels itself,  
then go to the first frame and we’ll save  the file  Go to the first frame, if I play  
stop it, so you can increase the size  of the voxel as per as your requirement,  
and also you go to the first frame  Now, I  will select the fluid container at first,  
shift select the rocket  Okay, So, we will go to  fluids and I need some amount of collision, so  
I will just go in the fluids and we have the make  collide  We’ll click here, now it will collide  
some amount of smoke in this, and also one  more thing we have to do  We’ll select the  
container and shift select this and in the fluid  itself we’ll use same thing, make collide   
and we’ll check all of them, and okay so we’ll  off the texture and we have the lighting  As  
And as you can see if I just move it like  this, if you select this one, you have  
all the features like shading and all  You can  just work with the help of the colour and all,  
you have all the features like colour, you can  change the colour  From here just click here,  
change the colour, as if you need it to change the  colour  Okay so, you have this one and increase it  
like this way; we need smooth, so it will smooth  the same  As you can change the colour from here,  
click here, click here, just change the it’s  colour  If you need more oranges’ tone,  
you can do it well, you have all the freedoms  So, like this way and also we have input bias,  
you can increase the input bias as per your need   And the edge drop off will not increase this, 
we will not require this  Here you have the  opacity, just can work with the opacity  If you need  
more opacity, you can work, but like this you can  don’t have to work here  We have to work between  
you can see I am mainly working in the fluid  shape and that we will go to here, we’ll have some  
them and instead of linear, we will go to smooth   So, we can see a curve is getting smoother and  
smoother, so opacity is density,  you can change the opacity   
But, I think density would be fine because  it’s getting the shape of here, and also  
you can just decrease the size  Now, as you  have seen in the previous tutorial also, we  
have worked with the transparency; or you can work  quite well  Because you know all the parameters  
right now and we have discussed same thing in the  previous session  But, few amount of modification  
we required in this session  So, like this way you  can just make your own, own fluid dynamics with the  
experiment of this all  You can have to work in  your bonfire or meteoroid or even smoke and all   
So, now you have the idea how you can achieve  those results with proper experimentation   
adjustments and all  So, in lighting we have self  shadow, click here to have a self shadow  Okay, so,  
after having self shadow, I will go to outliner  again, will select this fluid emitter one  And  
after that and in fluid emitter we have fluid  attributes, so which is currently off   
So, on this thing and here you have the density  Method, so I will add this, okay we’ll not change  
this one  You have the voxel and section, so we  have this part and will increase this by ten;  
and put this sphere inside this  Okay, Now,  our rocket is moving, but not the sphere 
so we have to link it quite  So, will select the  sphere and in the outliner tab, here you have the  
﻿Hi everyone, so as we have done the playblast and  I will show you the result  So, as you can go here  
And render it in seven twenty or even if you  want to go to higher, you can go to ten eighty p   
So, now you have the idea how you can  just make the fluids inside Maya software,  
so we will learn about the end cloth inside Maya  application  So, let’s meet to the next session 
and just hit on the playblast, so you can have the  playblast  So, what the result is that this is the  
result, so as I scroll here, as you can see it's  forming quite well and see the result is quite  
good  You can have the colour correction and all  in the compositing software  So, like this way  
it will work, so playblast is very important   So, I have just playblast it and these fumes  
are going here and there, and the irregular  shapes that is forming quite good result   
And also you can work in the colour, so you  can also make a scene and work in the colour   
And put some you can say put some background image and put  some lighting  You can also work in mental ray  
or even in Arnold, so like this way you can  check with the help of the playblast  And  
after that if you are satisfied just go to  the batch render, and use the batch render   
﻿Hi everyone, in this session we will make  soft body dynamics inside Maya application,  
R button for scale and will scale this up, so that  it will also blow  So, now I will select this part  
will move up a little bit, and will  go to nDynamics, and here you have  
the nMesh, which is create nCloth click  over here  Now, as you can see a new  
nucleus has formed, this is the nucleus of  this nCloth  As if I play what you will see,  
it’s just going down and nothing happening   See, It’s just going down and nothing happening,  
so, at first I will increase my timeline to two  hundred  Then what I will do, I will select this  
and will go to attribute editor, and  here you have the nCloth shape   
In nCloth shape, you will find very much detailed  panels, so at first, we will focus on pressure   
So, here is the pressure, so I will just decrease  its pressure, I think four thirty three is fine  
so let’s gets started  Now, what I will  go? I will go to polygon and I will go to  
minus zero point four thirty three  And after  that what I will do, I will play one again,  
so as you can see, its get synchronize and just falling into  the downwards  So, I need to fall into the  
grid, so what I will do, I will go to  nucleus, and here you have the ground plane,  
which is just below to gravity and wind  So,  we will not using gravity and wind from here,  
we will somehow use from our upward panel  So, will go to ground plane and use plane   
When you click over the use plane, then you have  the plane frequency also  So, I will just increase  
it little bit, I think three seventy eight is  fine, and if I click over here  You will found  
smoother view, so I need my balloon to be start  from this position  If I go here and just play,  
as I need that my balloon will start from  this position and will blow  After that will  
polygon tab and here you have a sphere  Now, I  will just drag a sphere and will drag this upward  
float in the air, so, what I will do, I will go to  n solver, and here you have the initial state   
So, I will do set from current, so in  nSolver you found this particular one,  
and here you have the set from current  If I  click as you see we are in sixty seven frame  
as when I click here  Now, it will start  from the first, this is my initial state,  
what I will do, I will select this part  And make  sure that you will not change the pivot, let it be,  
and I will go to attribute editor   And here you have the nCloth shape  
and after that what I will do, I will go to  pressure tab, so, here we have the pressure   
Make sure that you are in first frame and  after that just click over here, set key  Okay now I will just  
will move forward  And after that, I will  need to start blow my balloon, so I will put  
a little bit and, go to input, and here you have  the subdivision axis, height  So, if you just put  
and will go to, but it’s not going upward,  so what we have to do? It’s just coming back   
And after that here is the magnitude, so  will increase magnitude upto twenty five,  
enter as let’s check  So, its going I think top,  
we have to increase the magnitude, so I will  put around forty five, let’s check at first   
ok fine, so, what I will do? I will select  this part, set key will put zero,  
and set key again, will move little bit,  
fifty five and fifty five that would be okay  As  we have increase its segments, you can increase it  
will increase five, will move forward,  will increase five, I think we need  
sixty five and will set key  Now, it’s gone     00:08:39 --> 00:09:12 As you see, its blow and its gone  Okay, now what I will do?  I will just off this  And will go to first frame
and now will press five button, and will go to  surface  Sorry polygon and here I have the plane,  
so I will make a plane  And let’s make a  plane because I have to add the thread also,  
so this would be the plane  And select this and go  to channel box and here you have the input panel   
I will not increase the width,  I will increase the height, and  
upward a little bit, will put  somehow over here  And will go to nMesh 
as much as you can, but make sure  that your PC will not been hanged   
create nCloth and make sure that your ground plane  is being checked, use ground plane  Okay fine,  
We don’t have to increase or decrease the plane  bounciness or frequency, friction sorry   
what I will do just pause over here  So, I will  select this and will make initial state, set from  
right click, go to vertex, select  this part  And here you have  
the n constraint and here you have the transform,  click over here  Now, it sticks to the ground  
and what I will do next I will select this  part, right click, hold your right click, go  
to vertex will select this area  And will shift select this area, right click,  
go to vertex, and I will stick the vertex  somehow from here, by holding shift button   
Because directly affect your CPU, if you increase  its axis and height segments, so after that will  
And what I will do I will go to constraint  and component to component  So, now you find  
the two lines which is formed here, so  at first I will just select its vertex  
and will shift select  And will right click, go  to vertex and will shift select both of them,  
and will go to n constraint and move to  component to component  Now, what happen see  
and there are lots many panel, so we have to focus  
on a particular panel  And so here I will just open my  
constraint and the dynamic constraint  to which is been stick to the balloon   
So, this dynamic constraint we don’t require,  but this constraint we required  So, if I go  
here what I am finding let’s see, I will just put  four for examine only  And will put the grid off,  
go to the deformation  And here you have a  particular thing, which is sculpt deformer  If  
let’s have a look,  
as you can see it’s not stick to its surface   So, we need to stick to its surface and  
here you have the constraint method, we  have the weld dynamic constraint attributes   
So, let’s see  Press four,  
you can see its stick to its  surface, just move with it,  
press five, as you can see here its stick  to its surface  Now, let’s have a look,  
if you need more pressure into the nCloth  system, you can put, I will just pause over here  Now,  
you have the idea that how you can create the  balloons, and how you can put pressure and all   
So, instead of having this, you can also play  with any other or even with your model also   
I click before I clicking I will just press four,  so that you can see it a wireframe  And if you  
And you can also use textures, if you want  to use texture, you just go right click,  00:14:50 --> 00:15:12 Assign new material and just use the blinn because that’s a balloon Because of shines as you can see here  So, what I will do?  I will just go to its, okay one more I just have to apply,
assign new material  blinn  And now it’s applied  to its surface, now I will change the colour  
to light blue  So, much more like  this and will do the transparent also   
Now, you can see and you can also use the  background, or just render this thing to  
have a good background into compositing  software  Like this way you can also  
work, so hope you have enjoyed it   Let’s meet to the next session 
click here, you will found a new thing will form  inside it  Now, what I will do I will just put  
﻿Hello everyone, so in this session we will  understand the features of soft body dynamics   
Ok,Here you have the outliner which we have opened  shape is all you see  Because you need to make  
I will go to display mesh again   
So, now as you can see there is a note, so  here you can read, A water filled balloon is  
simulated here by using the volume pressure  So,  we don’t have to go to this message and all; so,  
Ok,I will close the same because  it’s opening the option; so ok,  
now will go to hypergraph hierarchy  And what else  we have, we have Blob, nucleus and nCloth one  So,  
this would be the output cloth, and this  would be the nucleus, this would be the Blob   
So, if I select the Blob,as you  can see it’s showing over here;  
let’s continue  So, at first what I will do  will go to polygon and here I have the polygon,  
if I select the nucleus, it will show over here   If I select the nCloth, it will show over here;  
so, this is very important  Hypergraph hierarchy  is basically for doing connection internally;  
so we will discuss this laterwards  And it has all the sub tools which is  
embedded in it as you can see here  So, it’s  basically the internal collection or the internal  
link between the objects and the effects and all;  
so, this is very important  As you  can go over here also, or you can over  
connect all the things in hypergraph hierarchy  also  This is you can say little bit of typical  
but it will show after when you open it; it will  show block by block that would be easy to find   
Whatever you click over here it will directly  give the information; and in attribute  
editor the property feature will be came  So, as you can see we have output Cloth one and  
So, at first will go to box; I will  just maximize this particular section of  
make sure that whenever you animate, you have to  look at your timeline  Now, we have one twenty, so  
I did I did need at least two hundred; two  hundred will be fine  And now for animation  
there is a hot key, which is S; as you can see  here there are the translate X, Y and Z all are  
not activated  But, whenever you press S  button; all the things will be highlighted with  
you can sey pinkish colour  So, here also your  timeline gets animated and I will go forward by  
at twenty, twenty five frame  And will press S again  
S the same, nowyou can see its coming; that  means we will just give the translate value  
perspective  And I will just drag a  box and after dragging what we will do  
to fourteen  And we will put S button,  so it’s gets animated; so now play,  
I think it’s fine  I will increase  by two fifty again, will select this;  
after two hundred into twenty  It will  go round here, eight would be fine  
So, now we have a like a bounce in and  bounce back and will stop at that point  So,  
as we have animated and we will also change the  rotation also; so we need to edit the rotation   
So, I need to change the rotation from here;  so I will put the value of rotation around  
and press S; will go up to here, plus  three hundred  Press S will go up to here  
we will put over here, somehow over here   And so after dragging we will go mesh  
so I play forward   
let’s see ok  Now, what else we have will go to nMesh and  
again, but this time will choose the  display current mesh; and will play now   
ok fine will pause this, now make sure that you  are saving your file; so saving is very important   
So, I will just make a new  folder will name maya dynamics  
should have to save in ASCII  You can also save  in binary, but sometimes binary gets corrupted;  
but ASCII will not corrupt  If there is a mistake;  
and here you have the smooth  So, we will smooth it  
then obviously it will corrupt the same  So, ASCII will be fine and I will rename this  
fluid underscore zero zero one, fine   
a dynamic properties as we discussed earlier   But, this time will go to dynamic property map;  
so it will down of the dynamic property just  below of it  And you can find over here,  
So, we will just go to wrinkle map type;  wrinkles means it has wrinkles   
That means it has structure  like irregular shapes and all;  
so wrinkle map  Here you have the wrinkle map and  here you have the texturing panel  This is the  
texturing window, so we will just click over here;  and now we have to put some noise  So, for noise I  
and after that what you have? This shape; so  
will go here, you have the noise texture; when you  press the noise, now the noise panel will came   
So, in noise you have time which is very  important; so it’s need to be animated  So, for  
I will start from here, so will select the time;  right click, set key or you also click by S   
But, it will animate all the things; so I don’t  need to animate all the things  Because laterwards  
if I came to any of the panel; that would be  hectic for me to just remove the same  So,  
will go up to here  And just put five  on the keyboard at thirty frames,  
fifty would be fine; five and  set key  Now, it will change;  
are simulating something and  if what is simulation means?  
now what I will do I will just double click  it  And now we have the tool setting of this  
That means if you are working in effects and  all; if you producing anything inside Maya   
Its need to store its data for further use; that  means one time it will cache the same  After that  
the data will be saved to your computer and you  don’t have to play one by one again  You don’t  
have to just put your time in that particular  simulation; you have the cache data  You have the,  
you can say the rendered baked data, you can  run across the timeline; and just see if this is  
possible  Now, this is getting not updated at the  back; but it’s getting updated at the front   
That is not happening in the cache;  so I will select the Blob data   
Here the Blob thing has been selected,  and will go to there you have the n cache   
And in n cache you have create new cache; so will  go to its panel, and here you have all the things   
So, I have the cache directory user, that’s my  macbook name, documents, maya, project, default,  
particular move tool  You know better that  if you press W, then move tool will came;  
cache, cache fluid zero zero one; so, that is  fine  You can just put your name blob animation;  
so I putted Blob animation, and I think  everything is fine  You don’t have to just  
one file per frame is fine, not one file; because  it will generate only one image at a time   
So, I need one image per frame that means we have  two fifty frames; so we need one image per frame   
And time slider is fine, we don’t need render  settings; because we will do it laterwards   
So, it will just generate after one frame,  every one frames and before it and after it  So,  
running quite smooth  So, that’s the main feature  of cache and you have to rename it properly   
if you press E, then rotation will came; if you  press R, then scale will came  If you want to  
more into its detail  And its attribute editor  and will add some much more modification in this   
So, let’s meet to the next session, and make sure  that before going I will just save my scene data;  
created something wrong in that particular  version; you can go to the previous version   
Or, if your file gets corrupted at that particular  version; you can go to the previous version    
And you can work for the same; otherwise you have  to make from beginning  So, that would be hectic,  
so make sure that you are making your version   So, let's meet to the next session 
go to its property feature, just double click  it; and here you found the tool settings   
And we will also look at Byforst inside Maya two  thousand fifteen; so let’s continue  Now, at first  
So, we will go to move tool and we have this  tool setting features; so here what we have?  
we will just go to vertex and  select the vertex here, and  
so we’ll go to x axis; let’s see  
so you have the symmetry feature here  As you can  drag, now because here you have the x axis and  
here is the x axis  So, if I select this, it will  just produce in the X; because we are in object  
mode  And here is the X, if you go to Y; then it  will produce somehow over here  If you go to Z,  
then it will produce somehow over here; so, will  go to X and after that we will off this thing   
Now, we will whatever we will do here;  it will automatic adjust it in the  
what I will do? I will just go to polygon  and here we have the polygon features    
opposite direction  So, I will make  this particular thing more thick and  
kind of structure; and go to object mode   And I will rename this, so for rename  
what I will do I will go to window and here I  have the outliner  So, I will adjust this outliner  
viscosity; it has viscosity and it will have a  jelly like structure  So, I will rename it Blob,  
ok,now will minimize it; so we have outliner  And what I will do next  
I will go to mesh again and will just go  to smooth; now this time I will not select  
this smooth here  I will go to its window panel;  here is the setting of smooth and here you have  
the division level  So, I will increase the  division by two, I think two is fine    
Apply, it’s apply over here and will cross  the same  And go to object mode   
So, if you select any of them, if you change any of  the panels as we discussed earlier  After assets  
So, let’s make some much of more irregular shape;  if you select any of the part  If you press B,  
then soft selection will came; As you can see I  am holding B button  And by left mouse button,  
you can drag the size of your brush; so that  means if you want to off this of selection   
Just pres B again; and if you want to on, just  select any part, press B  Now, if you hold your B  
and left mouse button, you can increase the size  of your brush  So, I can change little bit of it,  
it is a irregular type shape; and what else  we have now  Or, we will go to modify and  
here you have the freeze transformation  What  freeze transformation does? It will just put  
all the value to zero zero zero and only scale  will have one  So, that means it will freeze to  
its position and freeze transformation all the  values has gone zero, and only one is there   
all the things will be changed from the top;  that means each and every panel have their own  
Now, what I will do I will go to edit and here you  have one more thing to do delete by type, history   
So, it’s very important to delete and clean its  history; so now I will select this file  I will  
on my outliner and here I have the Blob  These  all are for the four views of Maya as you can  
see here; these are all four views of Maya  So,  here is the default light which is attracting  
over the surface and the viewport  There is  the default object set, so this is called  
the object set tool; so we don’t have to look  at it  So, we will focus mainly in the work   
So, what I will do now? I will just change my  panel; will move this little bit little here   
So, select it, I will change its panel to  nDynamics; so we have two things  This is dynamics  
and if all the things will come with the nucleus;  all the things which come in nucleus  It has kept  
over here, which is nDynamics; that means nucleus  dynamics, so I will just click over nDynamics   
property features  And whatever you drag here,  it will all come over here; in attribute editor  
Whenever you click over nDynamics, you have  all the features change at the top  So,  
in nMesh you have create nCloth; so  I will just create in nCloth, click   
And now as you can see in the outliner, if I drag  this; a nucleus and nCloth one has formed   
This is the you can say the object feature of the  nCloth; this is also called the property feature,  
and this is the nucleus  As in bone, we have  pelvis region, and in dynamics we have nucleus; so  
this is the center of modification, center of axis  and all  So, I will minimize it for now and as you  
can see if I play; it is going down  Because we  don’t have just edited it, so we will use it;  
and make sure that your nCloth has been selected   So, it is by default selected and this is the  
nucleus  What we do now, we will go to attribute  editor; and I will just put somehow over here,  
here is fine  So,   
and in channel box to manage its feature  Dynamics has very much values and also you have to  
I will go to attribute editor and in  attribute editor, you have two features;  
which is nCloth shape and nucleus  So, this is  the nCloth shape and this is the nucleus  All the  
property features related to its shape will come  over here; and all the property features related  
to its behavior will come in the nucleus  So, what  else we have? So at first will go to nCloth shape;  
here you have the preset inside nCloth  shape one  So, if I click the preset,  
I needed jelly like structure; so  in preset you have many things 
So, I will just go to waterballoon and here you  have the replace; so I will do the replace   
Now, it is been applied over  here and what else we have?  
And if I go here; we have the dynamic  property  So, there is a lot of more things, so  
the main things we will focus here; because  there is a lot of more thing  You can  
go to through it very thoroughly and you  have to also practice quite well  Then you  
keep on experimenting the things and you  will or get all the things, and so I will  
go to dynamics property now  And in dynamics  property, here you have the input mesh attract;  
so we will not select this right now; we  will discuss laterwards  What this will  
do? This will allow it and form some amount of  giggleness into it; that means random movement  
or you can also say exact motion of it  And it will attract the mere by particles,  
which gets collide into it  So, we will use  this laterwards and now what I will do I will  
go to nucleus one; and in nucleus one there  is more features  Whenever I am playing it,  
it’s going down; so we don’t need to  go to the down  So,what I will do now  
here if I go down, you gave the ground plane  
and here is the use plane; so, we have to  check it  ok Now, there is lots more features,  
can understand it, so that means whatever you  see in this tutorial, you have to practice it;  
you have the scale attributes; I  will open this and what else we have  
time scale and space scale; so, these both  are for animation purpose  So, we will also  
discuss this laterwards after few times  So, now I will go to nCloth shape one,  
as I have discussed that we  will just focus on this  Now,  
input mesh attract, so I will put little bit of  it; that means zero point one that would be fine   
And now we will run the simulation, let’s see what  happens  As you can see it’s behaving quite well  
as compared to the previous one; see, so I will  just go to the first frame  If you click here you  
can go to the first frame; as there is a message  window, also go to the start of playback range   
here you have  Click on the same, click  and after that what else we have   
because we will undergo through  many values and modifications, so  
﻿Hi everyone let’s continue to this session now  what I will do I will go to attribute editor   
and get ejected out   
So I will pause this now if you press  three it will add smoothness and after that  
just select any of the part, right click, go  to assign new material and here you can put any  
other material, so I will put Blinn  And in Blinn you may have the color  
and you can implement the color like this or if  you want to add the texture you can go over here   
You just have all the things so if you want  to add noise you can add noise and press six  
so you have the noise  Now if you want  to change the color you can change  
of lustre in it and here you have the color panel,  click over here and here you have the fractal   
because layer management is very important just  I have to put over here  I will rename this  
some amount of stickiness in it because we have  just make the ground which is passive collider  
and these all are cloth which is basically  N cloth we just putted over N mesh   
So you can take the seamless texture because  as you can see here is the seams which is get  
produced when its moving around  So you can simply  put some sort of texture or even you can also  
ok, now we’ll have selected the particular object  as you can see over here we have just selected  
the object from the outliner and right click we’ll  add selected object  Now you can hide easily  ok,  
it’s going so much of down, so I  just select the box only we’ll drag  
this little bit will put it somehow over  here  So we’ll go to another view and  
we’ll check by, four pressing you can check  As you can see if I just play it what happens?  
So I just press five now I have to put it  over here somehow over here ok fine, So, now  
what I will do,  
And now at first we’ll go to outliner, we’ll just  put the outliner over here somehow over here   
I will just select this and we’ll go to modify,  
freeze transformation because I have the  values by and I have to just put it zero  
zero so freeze transformation and now I  will just select this box and we’ll go to  
edit delete by type so we don’t need any type  of history  And now the history is cleaned so  
we have a box and the blob  Now we’ll go to window and in window  
here you have the hyper graph  hierarchy  So here you find  
we have one more thing is that bifrost   So will select the bifrost and here you  
the liquid so we will select the liquid click, now  
And now in attribute editor I will go to nucleus  one  In nucleus one there are more features but  
it has formed over here but you cannot see  So I will just put four as I play forward  
and it will catch the same  
now what we will do I will select the blob  shape and we’ll go to attribute editor  
and we’ll select the bifrost shape  here we have the bifrost shape   
Now we’ll go to bifrost liquid container one,  
so we will discuss this later wards because we  have to just go through the collision and all  
so at first I will go to bifrost shape one   And what I will do we have bifrost meshing  
and I will go here and will enable it  So now what we will do  
if I press three what happens see, it will  smooth it as its forming more precise thing   
As you can see its bouncing so much and now  we’ll just add assign new material and we will  
at first what I will do I will just deselect  it  So I don’t need the nucleus property  
add the ocean shader let’s see what happens   Ok, Now here you have the ocean attributes and  
you have all the things lied at over here that  means you just have to apply one by one   
And we’ll press four  
now what we will do, we’ll select the  bifrost liquid and we’ll just select the  
So what I will do now instead of using ocean  now I will just assign new material and just  
put the Blinn only because it is getting heavy  so much so now you can see it’s looking fine    
So for checking purpose I just put the ocean  and but when we use to compose that sort we  
features over here  So if you deselect the  unable, the nucleus property features will be  
will just put the ocean shaders later wards  we’ll press four and we have all the things  
so we have bifrost mesh and we have  bifrost panel, we have bifrost liquid   
So all the things are coming  over here so what else we have  
right now in bifrost we have the collider so  we will just apply the collider now you can  
see the collider has applied  And there is a  small dot like structure is forming over here   
So as you can see now it’s showing again all the  things property features  And you have pressure  
if you increase the pressure damping little  bit of it and just go to the previous frame   
And if you can see that somehow it  will change it shape and all   
off and your simulation will play smoothly  as compared to the previous one   
So you can collide so now you have the  idea how you can create the viscous  
liquid and you can go to start pressure and  you can also work with pump rate and all  
so we have just made the simple liquid   So you can collide with any other object  
so we had to just click over the create passive  collider and it will collide the same  And also  
you have to do some modification with attribute  editor and all because it’s very important   
Now you have the idea about the nucleus and the  N cloth first I will just make a new version  So  
go to file and we’ll make a new version save scene  as I will just make a new particular version   
So, if I select this part and at first I will go  to first frame  As you can see we have applied  
bifrost and all in this and if the collide  will happen then we will apply some textures   
So, now what I will do I will just select  this part and will do the control D    
If you on this thing that means nucleus will  embed its property features to your model  
If I do the control D if I go  previous frame what I will get?  
I will get nothing because the animation will  not been copied  So I will delete this and we’ll  
put the fresh part so control D again  Now as  you can see we are in first frame so we have  
taken this shape of it  And it will automatic  update the shape as if you are in middle frame   
Whatever shape will came, it will automatic  copied in the duplicate version   
So I will just put that first shape and after  that what I will do I will just select this  
part and this would be second cloth  And we will  put the second cloth modifier so what we will do,  
we will go to mesh and here we have the  create N cloth as we have discussed earlier  
and after clicking over the N cloth, we will form  nucleus and in attribute editor we have N cloth  
shape two  In shape two we have the preset   And as you can see there are collision and  
or your geometry  And it may take few times  so I will just deselect it that means I will  
all the things embedded over here  So at first you should go to preset  
and we’ll change it to water balloon and  we’ll replace it same  If need so much more  
of its result you can go to blend ninety or even  seventy-five percent or fifty percent  So I will  
replace by hundred percent, so I will replace  it and when it replaced it shows the note;  
the water filled balloon to be simulated here  by using the volume  So that means it has been  
applied to that particular body  Now  
going to dynamic property which is just below  it here you have the dynamic property and  
in dynamic property there is input mesh  So  as you can see here there is the input mesh  
attract and this is zero point zero zero  we will make this zero point two as you  
can increase this little bit  And enter it and  after that we will just select the ground and  
as we have did it before but we will just do  it right now create passive collider   
Now we will select the blob shape and go to  its attribute editor and here we have the N  
cloth shape to which is by default open  So in  the dynamic property map, we’ll go to dynamic  
you can have the noise which is by default texture  present in Maya I will just click this noise   
And after that we’ll go to time  
here you found the time and  we’ll animate it one by one   
So make sure that you are in first frame  right click set key and we’ll go further  
as you can see its getting  collide with that particular one  
I will just put this in a particular layer  
﻿Hi everyone in this session we will make soft  body dynamics inside Maya application     
R button for scale and we’ll scale this so that it  will also blow   So, now I will select this part  
I will just select this part move up a little  bit and we’ll go to N dynamics  And here you have  
the N mesh which is create N cloth click over  here  Now, as you can see a new nucleus has form  
this is the nucleus of this N cloth  As if I play what you will see  
it just going down and nothing happening see  it’s just going down and nothing happening     
So, at first I will just increase my timeline  to two hundred then what I will do  
I will select this and we’ll go to attribute  editor and here you have the N cloth shape   
In N cloth shape you will find very much detail  panels so at first we will focus on pressure  
so here is the pressure so I will  just decrease its pressure   
So, let’s get started  Now what I will go,  I will go to polygon and I will go to  
I think four thirty-three is fine minus zero  point four thirty-three and after that what  
I will do I will just play one again    So, as you can see its get synchronize  
and just falling into the downwards so I need  to fall into the grid   So, what I will do,  
I will go to nucleus and here you have the ground  plane which is just below to gravity and wind so  
we will not using gravity and wind from here  we will somehow use from upward panel   
So, we’ll go to ground plane and use  plane  When you click over the use plane,  
then you have the plane frequency also, so  I will just increase it little bit I think  
three seventy-eight is fine and if I click  over here, we will found that its just  
fall to the ground   So, as you know that I  am making a balloon  I will press five for  
smoothen view   So, I need my balloon to be start  from this position  If I go here and just play  
polygon tab and here you have a sphere  Now,  I will just drag a sphere and we’ll drag this  
as I need that my balloon will start  from this position and will blow   
initial state so I will do set from current    So, in N solver you just found this particular  
one and here you have the set from current  If  I click as you see we are in sixty-seven frame   
As when I click here now it will start from the  first this is my initial state  What I will do  
I will select this part and make sure that  you will not change the pivot let it be   
And I will go to attribute editor here you have  the N cloth shape and after that what I will do  
I will go to pressure tab so here we have  the pressure, make sure that you are in  
stop right click again set key  
upward a little bit and go to input and here  you have the subdivision axis height    
we’ll move forward and after that I will need  to start blow my balloon   So, I will put  
and will go to but it’s not going upwards so  what we have to do its just coming back so now  
what we will do, we will just select this and  we’ll go to field and here you have the air    
it’s magnitude, go to outliner and here you have  the outliner and we will just select the air field  
and after that here is the magnitude   So, we’ll increase magnitude up to two twenty-five  
So, if you just put fifty-five and fifty-five that  would be okay as we have increase its segments   
so I will click one by one,  
we’ll increase by, we’ll move forward, we’ll  
and now we’ll press five button and we’ll  go to by polygon and here I have the plane    
So, I will make a plane and let’s make  a plane because I have to add the thread also  
so this would be the plane  And select this and  go to channel box here you have input panel   
I will not increase the width I will  increase the height and sixty-five   So,  
now go to object mode we’ll select this  strip and we’ll move upward a little bit   
You can increase it as much as you can but make  sure that your PC will not been hanged because  
We’ll put somehow over here and we’ll  go to create N cloth and make sure that  
your ground plane is been checked  used ground plane  We don’t have to  
increase or decrease the plane bounciness  or frequency friction so we’ll move forward   
Now, it will just collide with that particular  balloon and will fall and after that what I will  
right click go to vertex  Select this part  and here you have N constraint and here you  
have the transform, click over here now its  stick to the ground and what I will do next   
I will select this part right click hold you  right click go to vertex we’ll select this area  
and we’ll shift select this area right click  go to vertex and I will stick the vertex  
directly affect your CPU if you increase its axis  and height segment   So, after that we’ll go to  
somehow from here by holding shift button  And what I will do I will go to constraint and  
component to component so now you find the two  lines which is formed here so at first I will just  
select its vertex and we’ll shift select and we’ll  right click go to vertex and we’ll shift select  
both of them and we’ll go to N constraint and move  to component to component  Now, what happens see  
and there are lots many panel  
so we have to focus on a particular panel   And so here I will just open my outliner  
so you have the nucleus, the cloth which is  applied and the air field, dynamic constraint  
don’t required but this constraint we required    So, if I go here what I am finding let’s see  
deformation and here, you have a particular  thing which is skull deformer  If I click,  
As you can see it’s not stick to its surface  so we need to stick to its surface   
And here you have the constraint method we  have the world dynamic constraint attributes  
press five as you can see here its sticks  to its surface  Now, let’s have a look  
If you need more pressure into the N cloth system  you can just put, I will just pause over here   
Now, you have the idea that how you can create  the balloons and how you can just put pressure  
and all, so instead of having this you can  also play with any other or even with a model also  
and you can also use textures  If you want to use  texture you just right click assign new material  
Blinn and now its applied to its surface now  I will change the color to light blue    
before I clicking I will just press four so that  you can see it a wireframe and if you click here,  
So, much more like this and  we’ll do the transparent also  
now you can see and you can also use the  background just rendered this thing to have  
a good background into compositing  software like this so you can also  
work so hope you have enjoyed it   Let’s meet to the next session 
you will found a new thing will form inside it  Now, what I will do I will just put  
﻿Hello everyone  So, in previous tutorial we  have learned about the Arnold physical sky,  
Arnold is very important, specially this one,  which is area light and mesh light is not so  
required and photometric is not also, but this  one is physical sky is very important as it will  
change whole of your scene and this light which  is create light portal is also important as it is  
like that of mental ray, physical sun and sky   But in Arnold, it have some other features   
If I go to render setting and one more  thing is that, if you go to system,  
you find that render time is interactive  This is  because we have the particular section which is on  
off  You can also go from here or even  you can also change it from here   
Bucket scanning, this is spiral   What is bucket scanning? Whenever you  
rendered a particular section, there is a small  buckets which will just rendered the particular  
data  That’s the bucket scanning  So, just  put like, ok, fine, sixty four is fine and  
of the particular object and if you go to Arnold  and in lights, here you have the mesh light   
one more thing is that, here you have the  motion blur  So, if you have some animations,  
you can enable it and you have the environment,  you have atmosphere and background  What we have  
discussed that in mental ray there is a physical  sun and sky, you can also create from here   
Create AI atmosphere volume, create AI fog  or background legacy  AI physical sky creates  
and also, one more thing is that whenever you  are lighting a particular section, you have  
all the freedoms, that means you can change one by  one  That means you can also modify the lights  If  
you are not satisfied, control z sorry, if you are  not satisfy with a particular section of light,  
you can just change it through attribute editor  and there is a problem in selecting, you can go to  
outliner and here you have all the features   If you want to select this point and you  
So, what mesh light does, if you click here and I  press the seven, now you see, its converted into  
can’t select it because there is a mesh also  Make  sure that you have to rename each and everything  
properly, otherwise you will be  in problem laterwards if you have  
very much thing inside your scene  So, you  can also change your letter from here   
And one more thing is that, there are much more  options if you select this light, specially this  
one and go to attribute editor and here, inside  this panel, we have so much more panels like  
sub surface scattering, diffuse, specular,  indirect or volume which is by default present  
in your render settings also  But these  are different and these are different    
This is basically inside the light  and this is basically when your  
scene will be rendered, after that it  will apply the same  So, if you can keep  
increasing its value, then also it takes  some render time  So, now what we will do,  
a light  Now, as with the help of this, you  can also go to your additional parameters   
So, quickly I will add some couples of more light  and after that will add some animations  So,  
let’s make it  Now, I want to reposition all the  lights so, I will delete all the lights one by one  
and I just have only one light in  this particular section of light   
So, let’s quickly set up a particular scene   So, I have just erased all the lights and we  
have only one light here and  one more thing is that, if you  
One and one more thing is that, if you want to  erase it’s mesh lights, then you just select  
that particular section, press delete   Now, your mesh light will be deleted   
And now, let’s quickly set up a scene  for our lighting  And what I will do,  
Now, you have all the things which suits and  which you can change according to your needs 
I will just go to the seven view and just put  some of the lighting  At first, will go to six,  
control d and will put some lighting over here  and have a look and what we will get after that,  
let’s have a look  Will set the  colour and intensity laterwards,  
but will adjust the light   At first, will go to render tab  
and here we have the point light which is  omni inside Maya, we called it point light  
inside Maya, we called point light  So, will  put some of the point light because we need so  
little bit of bounceness over here and we  put some lights like this and after that  
what we have, we have the back part  So, will select this light only  
and control d, will move here and  just move here  And what I will do,  
just simply grab this, press r for scale  and will scale this  And will tilt this,  
So, now its converted into mesh light and you can  also change from here, the light visibility   
so that its position is just straight of it  So, just press seven and have a look  
that if this is quite well or not  I think its  quite fine and ok we have to work in the omni  
because you can select from here  You can work in  the omni because its bouncing so much, we need a  
little bit of bounceness, not this amount of   So, will just increase decrease the intensity by  
little bit of lower and what happens  if you have negative value in light?  
If you have negative value, it will just absorb  the nearby light's intensity  So, will not put  
any negative value  If you can, you can have  inside a particular big large screen  In studio,  
the artist use the negative intensity to absorb  nearby light intensity  So, ok now <?>23:00</?>  
I think, ok fine  And what we else have here,  
we will just put it somehow over here  and now, one more thing, the colour  
For a test, I will just a render a particular  image  So, at first, I will just check all the  
Also, you can put some of the small lights  here or you can use the spotlight or even  
the directional but directional will change  your whole scene so, will not use  You have  
the area light which is same as this one   So, like this way also, we have more lights  
and one more thing is that, I will just  make a new omni and will press w for  
move and what I will do, instead of going here,  I will just put it somehow over here, the top and  
Control d again and we have just duplicated it  Make sure that you are just moving downward,  
press f and if I increase the intensity of the  light, there is more panel like decay rate which  
is very important  In decay, there is no decay  so we don’t need no decay, we will go to linear  
things are in low quality, ok fine  Now, I will  just make a test render and what we will get,  
and you can see it is changed quite bit  So,  here also, you can just select this and go to  
linear and you can increase the intensity little  bit  Linear will act like normal environment,  
like natural environment and quadratic will  decrease it’s intensity lower, cubic also   
So, I just using the linear and here we  have soft bounceness of the lights   
So, if the render is not proper, then  we have to also adjust it because  
you can only do lighting in perfect way when you  just click on render again and again, then only   
So, we have just setted it scene  Make sure that  whatever you are making adjustment, you just  
save your file again and again because you have to  work in the, you can say, versions so that is very  
important  So, I am just saving my file again  So, now, what I will do, I will just go to  
bookmark and camera view one and  so, this is also test render, so,  
will get nothing because that light has  you can say vanished  So, what we will do,  
we don’t have to just require  As you can see,  here we have the bounceness of the omni and  
here we have the darker part, so we need to work  in this  Here also we have proper lighting   
I think this one is fine  This we have to work  And  we will use some amount of omni here also 
And  we will also shift this omni downward   If the omni will shift downward,  
then it will fall the whole surface here   So, we don’t required any light here because  
its already fine and what we will  do, will just select the omni,  
move little bit of down and what we will do, will  increase the intensity little bit and control d   
Move it to somehow here, will move it  to here, move it downward, move here,  
so we are not using any linear  or quadratic here because we need  
lights and if I go downward,  you have a Arnold panel   
here you have light visibility  and also in downwards   
Inside omni, you have Arnold panel   If you open the Arnold panel, you  
find some of the main features of light   You can use the exposure and sample value   
This will just use your RAM and graphic card   So, later on we will just increase it and  
we have visibility, light filter, so we don’t  require light filters and cast shadow, yeah, we  
definitely required cast shadow because  we need some amount of shadows also    
So, will duplicate this light, control d  And what  I will do, I will just put it somehow over here  
because as you have seen, this part is getting  darker and we don’t require darker thing like,  
so will put somehow over here  So, let’s have  a look in this particular section view   
Bookmark, camera view  So, its very important  to setup your light  If you are working in a  
particular movie, if the movie is getting,  if you are working in a particular shots,  
And now, if we go here, we have the additional  parameters which is by default present in Maya,  
but in this tutorial we will learn more about  its and we will add some more lights from  
if the shot is getting problem in few  frames, that means in that particular  
frame, you have to adjust the light   So, we need more intensity over here  So, what we  
in sense of, using intensity, I just put one  more here, which would be beneficial for me  
and will increase it's intensity   
you can say, and now we have to just have a good  render and will adjust few of the properties  
now, what else we have, select this, will  go downward and all the things is fine   
So, will go to render settings and  will increase the camera AA by eight,  
this is transform attributes   So, we don’t require this 
diffuse by, I think six, specular, exactly we  need specularity, so I think six  Transmission  
scattering instead of using transmission   So, it will produce some amount of glow   
In organic character modeling, especially in human  modeling, we use sub surface scattering in skin   
But we have mushroom in this section, so, we  will use this sub surface scattering little bit,  
so that it will just illuminate the light in  it’s corner and in the top  So, volume indirect,  
volume indirect will increase by two  Ray depth, we don’t require ray depth   
And here also we have specular but we don’t  require ray depth because we have just  
work in the sampling  Now, what we will  do, will go to view and go to bookmark,  
camera view  So, I will just pause this  video and will show you the render image  
So, here, you have the show original  mesh, no, we don’t required mesh   
and you may have the better idea that how we  can adjust by few tweaking the light and its  
Colour is fine  Use colour temperature, we don’t  light visible and cast shadow, cast volume   
so you can go over your intensity,  just play around your intensity   
I will just on the <?>3:59</?> so much  If  you want to change the colour of your light,  
yeah, definitely you can do it well, you have  all the freedoms, which lies over here, it will  
directly turn off your adjustment and all  So, here you have the use colour temperature,  
you can have all the things and make  sure that you just on the play button   
Arnold render engine and also we will look  at some of the additional parameters inside  
If I off this, as you can see, its getting bounced  if I off this  Now, you can see, the light colour  
which you have changed, its now updating over  here  So, if you just off this light visibility,  
it will off the same, but still, the bounceness  will be there due to this  So, you can modify  
bulb, tubelight inside a particular room   So, like this way you can work quite well and  
these are additional features inside Arnold, so  you can have all the things which have over there   
will go to bookmark and here we have the  camera view  Let’s have a test render   
As you can see, a light is over there,  if you need some sort of bounceness here,  
you can do it well, but we  don’t required bounceness   
For bounceness you just add few of the more  lights here by circulating its position   
attribute editor  So, let’s continue  So, what we have? We have this scene 
And you can have bounceness, but in lighting  as you have seen, in previous, that we have  
over here, and here is the sunlight which  gets bounced because its just bouncing  
from here and the shadow which is  generating over here is from there   
As you can see, over the  leaves area also, that if you  
see the leaves, the lower part is getting shadow  as compared to upper part  So, if you want to  
render a particular section, you just click  like this, if you want to render like this,  
click, I will go to camera AA, will  increase all the things  Transmission  
little bit because it takes so much of time and  we need sub surface scatter little bit 
So, for a purpose I will just press four  Four is  basically for wireframe  So, its very easy to  
so let’s have a test render   
and now, you have the idea about how you can  change the light and all  So, here we have another  
most important thing which is IES lights  So, here  have a couples of different presets of IES lights,  
which is available in Google by free  So,  you can go to any of the website which  
provides IES light and you can download for  max, Maya or any other three D software   
extension is ies file and its very small in size   So, now, what I will do, for IES lights you have  
this photometric light  So, this will allow you  to create some IES lights  If you click over here,  
now your photometric light has form, where  it is, here  I will press four for a time,  
handle the wireframe  If you are working in light,  you have to check through the render tab, but if  
go to here, press f to focus this particular  section  Now, just put it over here, somehow over  
just for the examine purpose,  if you can work like this   
You can work in perspective, if you are forming  the light  But make sure that whatever you work  
in perspective, you just have  to just rotate around your axis  
to see the correct position  If it is going in the  correct direction, then its ok otherwise you have  
to maintain it  Or even if you are not comfortable  in perspective, you can go to any other section,  
that is front, side and top   Or even, if you press shift button  
and right click button, by holding shift and  right click, you can change any of the view  
in your Maya  So, that’s a very much freedom  as you are not comfortable in perspective 
So, I will just drag this because we need space  We  drag over here and what we else have, let’s see,  
you are currently moving around your viewport or  if you are examine anything particular section,  
Now, have a look   
So, 
now, what I will do, I have just putted the  photometric light, which we have created from here  
and in photometric light, we have a particular  section inside attribute editor which is  
photometric file  So, here, we have the IES  lights which is a kind of photometric light  
and it is a open plugin   So, what we will do, we will  
just go to photometric file and here you have  the folder  Just click over here and just go to  
your desktop and here you have the IES lights  connection and you have to go to any of them   
I am just selecting any of the file  because we have to just check   
you can press four because, see, the scene  is getting lighter  But if I press seven,  
So, here you have the load  And after load, what  happens, see, if you go to seven, as you can see,  
now its generating quite smooth light, as you  can see the light is getting bounced like this   
Have a look, here you have the bounce   If you can increase the intensity,  
it will directly bounce like this   So, its also a bouncing kind of light 
You can also drag the same like this if you focus on  the top part like this or even you can also bounce  
like this  Its a kind of spotlight but not exactly  spotlight because if it has any surface to cast,  
then it will cast in proper way otherwise if you  move, it will just fall off and just work like a  
target light, but its not a target  light  Its a photometric and it will  
only work when you have IES light profiles  So, like this way, jut add some of the lights like  
this, press control d for duplicate, just align  the light  If you if you found any of the darker  
what happens, the scene will be  heavier  So, by pressing four,  
region like here because you have to cast the  shadow properly and you have the proper lighting  
area also  That means you just focus like this,  press w, just move backward and have little bit of  
bounceness of the lights  So, its very important  and to have a look at each and every lines   
So, if you select, we don’t required white colour  because already we have so much of white colour  
lighter blue and all  Ok that is good, back  of it is white, no problem  Just focus in this  
So, like this way you can add your IES lights   And you can <?>14:43</?> in render view   
So, if you are not familiar with IES light, you  can work with this rendering section and you have  
all the lights over here  You will find little bit  of same into both of them, but yes, few lights in  
you can go at that particular place  Ok   Now, one more thing is that if you select any  
﻿Hello everyone, so welcome in this lesson  of render layers inside Autodesk Maya    
and for that what I will do, I will just go to panels  and perspective, will go to camera and at night  
now what I will do  Once again I will go to  perspective by holding my shift button, spacebar,  
right mouse button, and go to perspective  So, as you can see the camera is right over here,  
we don’t have to displace the camera as we are set  this particular camera here, and also we will just  
render only one frame  So, in previous session  we have rendered the fifteen frames, because we  
are working on the batch rendering and all   So, we will just render in only one one frame,  
and what I will do? I will just select each  and every model  And will group the same and  
after that will just put all the lights in that  particular layer, and will render the same   
So, in PNG we will render all the data, and one by one we  will just save the data into the folder, and will  
compose into a compositing software  So, whatever lights you have make  
So, today we will look around the render layers  inside Maya software  As we are In channel box,  
inside the scene, you have to copy all  the lights in each and every layer 
So, one more thing I have to do, I will go  to window and here you have the outliner   
So, in outliner I will select all the lights  and after that what I will do? Control D  
for duplicate, and will just make a new layer   And will just hold this layer and will right click  
add selected objects  Now, you can see  your lights has formed, again I click  
add selected objects  Like this way you can  add the lights in a particular layer and so  
add selected  So, like this way I will add a couple of different  
layers and as you can see I am just implementing  the light in each and every layer, okay so,  
add selected objects  Now, what I will do?  I will just focus in this part only and  
will make some much more layers I think we  needed at least eleven, twelve layers    
you have seen this particular layer  which is inside display panel    
So, I will make twelve layers will just add  selected  So, now as you can see we have the  
master’s layer which has all the datas and we have  all the layers, which has only lights  So, what  
else we have to do? We will just select the parts  one by one and will just use the layers to just  
add some selected objects  So, right now what I will do?  
I will just select the lights and will make a  group, so control G and will rename this as light   
So, we have the light group and we have all the  layers, which are here and we have all the lights   
So, right now what I will do? I will just select  the lights and will control H to hide the same,  
will select this, shift H to unhide the  same  So, like this way you can hide because  
if I accidently select any of the, it will just go  to that place and will just transform from here,  
transfer to any of the layers  So, at first  what I will do? I will select this part,  
So, we will focus on this render layers, so what is  render layer? You will select each and every part  
group here is the group, so what I will do? I will  just select the group and will move to here   
Now, it’s been transferred to the outside  from the interior and now it’s a group,  
so, I will rename this wall, side wall   So, layer management is very important and  
if I select this side wall, I will go to layer  one and add some selected layers  As you can  
see we have hided the lights that’s why it is  not showing, shift H, it will show here   
So, control H and it will hide the same, so at  first make a new version  So, save scene as  
in a version so that would be fine, this would be  side wall, side wall  Now, I will go to master’s  
layer again will select this side wall, select  like this and control H to hide the same   
Now, will select the ground will  select this part and just move,  
step by step  And will off all the parts and will  focus on that particular part, and will render  
Now, will select this layer, okay right click  add selected and you have this ground   
So, control G group on the interior and  here it is, so the middle mouse button  
and just move it here  Okay   So, these are the small tables  
and just make a new, go to a new layer add  selected  So, if your layer is up and down, if  
you need these things to be up or these things to  be down  That doesn’t matter, you can put anywhere  
in the layer, so because we will individually  render all the images one by one  So, you can put  
sequence wise in your compositing software like  Photoshop, after effect, nuke and fusion  So,  
here if you just put some object in this layer,  some object in this layer that doesn't matter   
the same  This will allow us to just select  any of the part which is rendered in PNG   
We will just arrange in the compositing software  that would be fine  So, this thing is what we have  
small tables, I think add selected, so  this is the side wall which we have hided  
as you can see here  We have side wall  control H shift H you see the same,  
we have masters layer  So, we have ground shift  H, light shift H, control H to hide the same   
So, right click, shift spacebar, put  your spacebar, right mouse button,  
and go to the top view  So, what I  will do? I will just select these two,  
and enter  So, now what else we  needed? Control H to hide the same,  
same will click this part, and will just  group it control G to group the same,  
And after that when you import all the footage  into a compositing software, you can just directly  
right click  Move it here will not move any  of the layer, will move in between them, okay  
lamp table underscore two two  So, select this  control C will go here, right click, add selected   
Right now, we will go to master’s layer control  H again, and now will focus on the sofa,  
will select this sofa from here  And will control G to group the same,  
middle mouse button, and move sofa and after that  go to any of the layer  Right click, so go to this  
one control H to hide the same, will select  this wall which is the front wall  Control G  
and will just drag this here  which is the front wall,  
select the front wall of it, this will be fine   And will go to any of the layer right click,  
now will go to master’s layer  control H, to hide the same   
This would be the single wall, okay  so control G to group the same,  
focus on that particular part  And do whatever  changes you want in the compositing software   
now will just go to the master’s  layer and will hide that control H   
As we have this part, we don’t require this part  because these are the junk part, so, we don’t  
require this we have all the parts here  So, as  you have seen we have managed all the layers,  
and will just delete this layer, because you  don’t require these layers, so delete the layer   
Right now, I have hidden all  the things as you can see,  
so right now what I will do?  Now, I will just save this file,  
and will work in the render settings  And as you can see each and every panel has  
a simple same render setting here, if you click  you can go to its render setting  So, will just  
go to the next session and see about the  mental ray features, and after that will  
Like colour correction, brightness, contrast,  hue saturation and all the modification related  
to colour or anything  So, we will just render  one by one, each and every part, step by step,  
Hello everyone, so in this session we will do the render layers, and also will just use
Okay 
So, right now what else we needed?
Will just not needed the master layer, but will not delete it 
Because that’s the main layer, so what else we have to do?
Will go to panel and we will go to camera 
Okay so, in perspective we had camera and as you can see we don’t require the animation,
and what else we needed 
We just go to side wall and will render one by one and at first will go to render settings 
Make sure that it’s a mental ray that would be fine, so we don’t require final gather
and all 
some of the parameters of mental ray 
Global illumination we don't require, will go to common tab 
And if you are working in animation, that means if you have used the keyframes of animation
into camera or anything else in this scene, then you have to go to this 
As we have discussed earlier file slash animation ext, so you have to go to this 
And now you can activate your frames, that means how much frame you needed for that particular
one 
Okay or, you can also use batch render for the same, to transfer in another PC 
So, I am not using any animation will go to the default settings, and what else we needed?
We will go to the here the preset 
So, I just needed the seven twenty p which would be fine and don’t try to displace
So, as you can see in previous session we have just make each and every part and will
your camera, because if the camera will displace, all the things will be displaced from its
main position 
And it will error to yeah just it will just produce the error method or error effect,
when you go to the compositing software and it will not match 
Okay, so please don’t try to displace your camera, don’t touch the camera, don’t change the
position of the camera 
That would be better, otherwise each and everything will be gone 
So, you have to just make and just put the camera again and just render the same, so
that would be hectic 
So, please don’t touch the camera and just render one by one, because we have to place
have just group it, and just rename it and just put it into different layers as you can
the fixed position, the position where it has been placed right now 
We have to place in the compositing software as same as this scene 
So, okay now will go to side wall and here you have the same option which you have in the
render settings 
So, if individually you want to just change the setting of the render of the side wall,
you can just go over here 
Or, otherwise if you change globally that means all of them so you can go over here 
That is here it will update all the layers, but here it will only update this particular
part 
So, I prefer to have global setting, but you can also do it well, I will not change the
see 
values 
So, as you can see all the things is fine, so image format is very important 
I will just choose the PNG, so because I needed the transparency 
Because, okay so, I just needed the PSD and after that what else we do?
We will just render the same, then also render from here will render from here 
I will just wait for a while, let it be render 
so, it’s not showing here 
Leave it because this here, but still let’s see is it showing or not here 
So, one by one you can go any of them layers and you can found the lights also and also
So, if something is not showing at your screen, please don’t try to just focus your camera
over here 
But, if you do it, whole the scene will be changed, your camera angle will change and
everything will not be matched 
So, will just render a final image also for reference purpose or either we can also use
this final reference 
The intensity is very high because each and every the layers has the intensity, so that’s
why the intensity is quite high 
So, what else we have to do?
the objects 
Will just at least delete all the lights from each and every layer, and will just render the same data 
And after that
will put the light, so the light is very very high here 
So, what else we needed?
We just select all the layers and will delete the same and delete here 
So, as you can see we have rendered all the things and also I have just rendered this
particular image, you can do it 
Well, I have just all the things as you can see here, we have the rendered layers, and
will put it all the references in this folder 
So, like this way you can just have to copy the same light in each and every layer 
And as you can see all the things is in PNG, and will just take this reference and will
go to the compositing software, and just do the compositing kind of thing 
So, hope you understand this concept and we will proceed forward 
And after that will go to master layer, select one by one object and just put it into the
each and every layer 
﻿Hi everybody, so in this session we will  learn about the multi pass rendering inside  
let’s start to work with the render layers   So, at first what I will do? I will just make a  
new folder and just make this render layers, so,  and will put all the render layers one by one   
At first, just go to the render settings see  Arnold is there okay fine, window outliner, and  
here is the model and here is the light,  which is sky dome light  So, okay fine and  
we have these lights also, so no problem,  
so as you can see we have just selected  the dome light which we have created    
And also we have this mesh light, so  we will have the multi pass rendering  
from starting in the next session  As you  have seen that we have setup this scene,  
and now in next session we will understand  the concept of multi pass rendering  
from starting  Hi everybody, so in previous  session we have just setup some of the textures  
and just go to this view, press spacebar,  right mouse button, go to the perspective   
and also this light  So, in this session  we will work in the multi pass rendering   
So, for working in the multi pass rendering  you should have this, which is launch render  
setup window, which beside the hypershade  So, click over here and now you have a panel,  
so here you can see render setup property editor,  these both are important  So, right now will  
go to the outliner, will on outliner here, and  will on this over here  So, now as you can see  
we have to just first render this scene and  so render camera is fine, and here we have the  
Arnold render  Okay fine so, will select the object  which is the complete scene and by shift selecting  
right click, create collection and in collection  you got this, which is the property editor   
So, now add all the things the  bedroom and the sky dome light,  
So, in the next tab we have the camera view  and in this tab we have the perspective view   
and after that what I will do? I will just  render the same  So, will render this scene and  
let it be rendered  One more thing you have to  do, I will just escape it and just escape it  
and will go to the Arnold tab, and here you  have two options this one and this one    
So, as you can see if you click here, you can have  the interactive render view, so I will just pause  
this for a while  And what I will do? I will  just click here and after clicking here, you  
got this panel, so you can increase or decrease  the values  For now I just put the default value,  
so one is the default value  So, okay at  first when you are working in Arnold,  
you will go to the render settings and in  render settings you have Arnold render   
So, as you can see camera AA which is three, so it  will produce huge amount of small points  If you  
increase this, now your footage which will render  in the render setup will be smooth  And also  
And now we will focus in this view, so what I  will do? I will just make the interior different  
will have bounciness of the lights, so I will just  increase the diffuse and some amount of specular,  
transmission and sub surface  Okay volume indication  will be three, sub surface scattering will be  
three, okay rest is fine  And one more thing we  have to do, I will render in HD five forty, okay  
all  Just click here, you will on this and just  work for the same, let it be render for a while 
with different textures and shaders  So, at first I will just select one by one  
and just press F to focus that part only   Now, we have this bed sheet, right click,  
assign new material and will use the Arnold,  so I am using Arnold Ai standard surface   
So, after that will go to attribute, here  you have the Arnold Ai standard surface, and  
so you can see there is a lots of more junk which  is forming here  It’s all the history, so at first  
what I will do? Just select that particular  object  Okay now, edit, delete by type, history,  
so it will raise all the junk history, okay  so, I will just select the bed sheet   
Maya two thousand eighteen, so let’s get started   As you can see we have just selected this model  
At first, press F to focus that particular  part and after that will zoom out little bit,  
and will see it, as you can see it here  And now  right click, assign new material and will first  
open the attribute editor, and will use the Ai  standard surface  So, we have Ai standard surface  
here and will change the colour to I think lighter  blue  And will use this particular material,  
but will change the colour, and will change  the colour to little bit of lighter blue   
So, will select all of them by holding  shift button okay and assign new material  So,  
I am just using this particular one, so as  you know that you have different materials   
You can also use that particular material, I am  using only that particular one  Will select this  
all of them by holding shift button and  
so for that particular, I will press  four, so, that we have a better view,  
and we will do the multi pass rendering inside  Maya, so, at first I will turn off my grid    
I am in wireframe mode  So, I have  selected all the cupboards, right click,  
assign new material  And Ai standard surface  will change the colour to lighter brown,  
somehow like this, and after that will change the  colour of the wall  Will select this part, press  
five again, as you can see we have selected the  wall and right click, assign new material same   
So, I am just using this one, you can change the  material and so if I just copy tab and that same  
tab will appear here  And as you can see you can  just drag this to have a better view, so you have  
the metalness which is zero  Okay fine weight will  just increase its brightness and contrast, so  
rest thing is I will don’t have to change it   And you can also modify according to your need,  
but right now we will focus on the multi pass  rendering  So, that’s a simple set up and will  
select this part, assign new material, same  Ai standard surface, will change the colour to  
So, for multi pass rendering you have to  just make sure that you have light, and  
somehow darker  Little bit of darker as compared  to this one and select this part, press F,  
select all of them, assign new material   
this final thing, which is the  bed part to surface and will just  
little bit of this colour  So, we have this  scene and right now as you can see will select  
all of them, and just go to window and outliner   Make sure that will just put in one layer and  
we have just hided this one  So, we will just  select this shift H to unhide it, and now what  
happens  Next will go to the render settings,  Arnold is there, okay no problem common   
So, in preset we have HD, so at first I will go  to six forty, four eighty for the examine purpose,  
so at first just go to the render settings   And here you can see render using Arnold,  
so, at first I will examine it   Now, what happens? See, if you are  
working in the multi pass rendering, you  don’t have to disturb the camera  Because  
if the camera is been disturbed, then if  you are going to the compositing software,  
then all the things will be disturbed  That  means you don't have to disturb the camera,  
camera will be in its position  So, that means  whatever you wanna render in multi pass rendering,  
that means ambient occlusion, diffuse, beauty pass  and reflection, refraction, shadow and all   
You just have to just render it in one camera,  and even if you have two or three camera,  
you don’t have to displace the camera  Because  each and every render sequence should follow that  
particular camera without have any prior changes  after when you are getting the rendering  So, that  
means if you are rendering in a scene, and if the  camera is setting on that particular scene, so,  
so I am using Arnold right now  So, what I will  do? I will just make a simple light which is a sky  
after that you don't have to change its position   So, when you go to compositing software, all the  
things which you have rendered in 3D software  will come one by one in each and every layer   
And will just compact in this particular one   That means you have to change the blending mode  
and just have some effects also  That means  combination of all the render layers in a  
particular scene, which is called compositing, okay  so, we will discuss this in compositing software  
exactly  So, we have another session, which is  called multi pass compositing  So, we will look  
that thing in the multi pass compositing session,  so, we have that one  Okay so, now as you can see  
we have the camera which is fixed and will not use  this part  At first, will just check is it working  
quite well or not, so just have a look   So, as you can see we have just set up only this  
sky dome light, and here you have the panels of  sky dome light  You can change the colour or you  
dome light as you can see, its just form here  And one more thing we have to do, I will just hide  
can even put the image, it will wrap into your sky  dome light  Okay instead of having sky dome light,  
you can also use physical sun and sky, so I am  just using sky dome light  Let’s have a look
what’s happening, so right now I think this view  will be fine  And for your texting you should  
always go to the lower resolution, because it will  take a huge amount of time  If you will go to the  
HD ten eighty p or seven twenty p, that  will take a huge amount of time, so, I will  
just select this one, six forty, four eighty  Because that will too low, okay this is fine and now  
as you can see, here you have the launch render  setup window  Click here, as you can see there  
and all the things which is coming here  So, will  discuss this laterwards and at first let’s have a  
look at our model  So, we are not displaying the  camera, a camera will set at its own position   
this light for a time and control H for hiding   And shift H for Yeah calling the hided object,  
That would be fine, so will escape  it to just off the rendering,  
and I think will select this part  and will go to perspective   
Make sure that you are saving your file,  so I will save, save scene as desktop,  
multi multi pass, underscore zero zero one  Now,  
so what we have to do, will just select this part  and here we have the mesh light, just click over  
here and just go to the attribute editor  And in  attribute editor you have all the features of mesh  
light, so, you can have the colour and all  Copy  tab and just look at it, light visibility on and  
now you can see the light is quite bouncing  and also we have the shadows and all  
which is generating here  And if I just escaped this,  
that means unhide any particular one  So,  at first you can see we have a camera here,  
by increasing or decreasing the value, that means  you have to follow the node which is this and  
this one  So, one by one you can experiment  the same, so one more thing we have to do   
You have the shadow density, make sure that cast  shadow is on, okay fine and so here is the shadow  
so, this would be fine  You can increase the  lights as you know each and every light the  
process of light and all, so you can use this  short of lights, which is present by default   
So, Arnold is a third party plug-in, so right  now what else we needed? So, this would be fine,  
you can also use the area light kind of area light  and photometric light, okay light portal and all   
So, as you can see here is the area light,  you can use the area light here, so, right now  
so I will just go to the panel, perspective and  render camera  So, I will set this to view here  
﻿Hi everyone, so as you can see there is a huge  amount of grains because I have just decreased  
occlusion, we have just you can say changed  the blending mode to linear burn, and here also  
we have changed the darker color  So, like this  way you have the render layers, you can work for  
the same  And after that when it’s done, make sure  that you will select all of them  Make a copy,  
right click, merge layers  So, all the layers is been merged in  
one and just go to filter, and I  will just put surface blur  Because  
you can say that we haven’t work in the grains  and all  So, I will use the surface blur  
and will okay, the same, so as you  can see it’s quite different   
Here we have some amount of jerkiness,  but after getting blurred, it will just  
fade outing  And so you can increase the camera  AA, which is inside Maya, so just go to the  
settings, and you can just go to Arnold renderer and  just increase the camera AA  So, you will have a  
smooth result, so like this way you can work  And also you can just have different settings  
like levels, curves, which will allow you  to do manual color collection  And just  
move it like this and you can see that there is  a huge changes, so, it depends on you can put it  
according to your need  And like this way  you will just put the layers one by one,  
into any of the compositing software, like  Photoshop, after effect and nuke, fusion like  
this okay  Photoshop is a image based compositing  software, so you can also work with the Photoshop   
And after effect and premier and you  can say the fusion is all are the  
video based compositing software  So, you can also make videos in Photoshop,  
because you have the timeline  Here you can  see the timeline, you can just put the time  
images, here one by one  And it will just  produce a complete short of image sequence,  
save  Now, we have saved the image and what I  will do? I will just go to the this one render  
which you can work as a video  file  So, like this way you can  
work in the Photoshop  Hope you understand  the same, let’s meet to the next session 
settings, and just create a new layer  Will rename  this ambient occlusion AO, and now for ambient  
occlusion, I just need only this this model  And what I will do? As you can see we have already  
used textures and all, not textures but the  shader and this <?>1:53</?> change the colour  
of the shader  And also the shader is little  bit of shininess and also we have just used this  
mesh light here  So, will override  this, so what I will do? Right click,  
create collection and after that right click, here  you the create material override  But at first  
will just add the models, as you  can see we have added the models, so  
will create material override  And in  material override when you just create  
the value of camera AA  As it is taking very much  amount of time, so I just putted only three    
the material override, you found this thing  So, just click over here in Arnold, in shader,  
in surface which is present inside  the Arnold, shader and surface   
You have Ai ambient occlusion, so I just putted  the ambient occlusion  So, as you can see,  
ok now will just click this on, as you can see  it’s just applied on your scene, but still we  
have this light  I think which is applied here,  will just open this, here is the table bulb and  
here is the light  So, now as you can see if I  go to beauty and just on the eye, you will find  
the colour of the beauty which we have did it  And  if I go to AO and just open the eye, we find the  
colour of the AO, which we have did it  So, like this way you can just  
put some layers and all, and after that  what I will do? I will just go to the this  
So, you can increase this, but it will really  takes few hours to render a particular image   
as you can see it’s rendering and also  the value or you can play with the ambient  
occlusion value and all  It will automatic  update all the things inside your scene,  
so, like this way you can add some values  And  also you can work with them and also we have  
this panels which is kept at the top  So, you can  also do it well, you have all the freedoms   
So, as you can see the ambient occlusion  render has done and also we have this panel,  
you can increase this if you need more  intensity and brightness and contrast  So,  
you can increase this according to your  need and I will just save this file, so,  
AO would be fine and jpg, okay so  multipass rendering, save    
So, what I will do? I will just create a new  layer and just putted the bounciness pass,  
bounce and also the glossiness   
So, I just decreased this because you know what  is camera AA and diffuse, specular and all,  
So, here we have the great collection  and after that what I will do now?  
I will just go to this pass  And at  first go to beauty and just select the  
bedroom and Ai sky, one  more thing we have to do   
Just click here and I think we have just deleted  that part, so the light part, so what I will do?  
Go to the perspective  Select this part and  
go to the light bulb, so mesh light,  and after that will increase the  
exposure and also the intensity  by two  So, let’s have a look,  
one more thing we have to do, will just go to  the bounce glossy and will select all the parts  
and will go to material override  And in material  override will go to Arnold shader surface,  
you can increase the value and it will take time   So, for this only, for multi pass rendering,  
So, here we have all the things  So, right now what I will use?  
I will just use this standard surface, which will  have only one colour, as you can see which have  
only one colour  So, right now what happens if  I just increase the metalness? As you can see  
it’s getting quite dull, and  we don’t require the roughness   
So, as you can see we have rendered  this bounce and glossiness pass  
and as you can see its have all the reflection,  and light is bouncing  So, it’s also producing  
some amount of reflection over here, and this  shadow basically here and here  So, you can  
see the shadow which is generating from here,  it’s quite just having a casting over here   
And light is also bouncing in the wall and  it’s also in low quality render, because  
I just putted the value which is lower as  you can see, and will render the same   
we have decreased the value of camera AA  So,  that it will just fast the process of rendering,  
So, we have one more render that’s not important,  but you can do it well  If you know the process,  
we have one more render which is the  wireframe render  So, select all the things  
and will go to the settings again and make a  new  So, you can just off this all of them and  
click over here, right click, create  collection and add all the things   
So, after that will rename this  
wireframe and what else we have to do? Just  go to the create material override    
And click here and just go to the Arnold, shader,  surface and here you have the Ai wireframe   
As you can see when will go to the panel  perspective camera and just render for a test,  
So, as you can see we have just rendered  this and you can have all the things like  
you can see all the things is in wireframe   So, this renders we don't need it, but yeah,  
you can do it, you know the process,  you can do it, so I will save this   
So, now as you can see we have rendered  all the images one by one, and with this  
image you can also go to your compositing  software and do the multipass compositing   
So, we will discuss the multipass compositing  and how you can achieve a good result  
in the compositing classes  So, with that  compositing class you may have the idea,  
how you can just combine all the images in one   And create a particular scene from that particular  
images, and also it will produce a good  result by combining all those images,  
and just blend it according to the need   So, let’s switch to the next session    
Hi everyone, so in this session we will  see that how we have just imported all the  
gain gamma here, which is also present  here  You can just increase or decrease  
images into the Photoshop  And will start just play  around the blending modes and will look at the  
result of this particular  So, now as you can  see we have just rendered all the image from the  
Maya two thousand eighteen and we have used  this, which is the render setup  And we have just  
make separate layers and just putted  all the information data like the model,  
and the light including this particular light   So, after that we have rendered separately,  
so as you can see, here, we all the datas  This is  the beauty pass, this is the ambient occlusion,  
this is the glossiness and this is the wireframe   So, we don’t need wireframe because wireframe is  
basically for having information about  the you can say the edges and all   
So, we don't need wireframe and whenever you  are inputting some image into your Photoshop  
should rename at first   So, double click,  
according to your need, if you wanna put some  gain and gamma on your scene  You can go to  
change this texture according to your need  and also you can work with the grains and  
all  You can increase the camera AA to have  a good result and have a smooth result  So,  
what we are getting here?  If I go to ambient occlusion  
on this and will just go to normal, click  here  And just move the down arrow as you  
can see, your blending mode is working quite well,  we have linear burn  And you can just switch from  
here and in this one  So, if I open this, you can  go, click here, and just move your arrow button,  
you can see whole scene will change  So, that’s the main fundamental of blending mode,  
so your whole scene will change, so, you can  put according to your need  If I drag this,  
you can see, that the particular part is getting  dragged control Z  So, like this way ambient  
﻿Hello everyone, and welcome to this session  of Color Theory  So, what is color theory?  
subtractive primitives  You can actually project  the additive color to produce the subtractive    
Subtractive primaries are based on ink color  of CMYK  Black is abbreviated "K" by tradition,  
perhaps because it is the "key" color  In color  printing, you need black to make the color  
vibrant and snappy  That is why the subtractive  process is also called the four-color process,  
producing color separation or "seps "  Color used as the process color   
Note that the effect in the ink in the  subtractive system acts like a filter,  
beginning with the white paper, all colors  So, if  you plane cyan ink and magenta ink over the paper,  
what do you get? Cyan green-blue, so transmits  those colors, and absorbs red  Magenta red and  
blue, so transmits those colors, and absorb  green  But, red has already been absorbed  
by the cyan, so the only color left to  transmit is blue, result would be blue   
can be defined as a pleasant arrangement of parts,  whether it will be music, poetry color or even an  
Question is the first you combine cyan,  magenta, and yellow, what do you get?   
Or a muddy brown inks are not put and it’s  impossible to get a good black by mixing them,  
hence the addition of black in the CMYK system   Printer use the four color system, called process  
color, as a way to avoid using a spot color  for each color specific by the illustration   
With only the four colors, CMYK, we can  generate all colors  The process color  
system does not actually makes the color on a  page, one atop the step  Instead the color are  
deposit overlapping each other, in a pattern at  a precise angle  We mix the color in our mind to  
set the desired color  In this way, each color  forms a dot, similar to the half tone process  
used for black and white "continuous tone", which  is called contone generate, as for photos   
Here we can see a close up of a half  tone pattern  Note the <?>closer</?>  
color visualization  So, in visual experiment  
the dots, the more overlap, and the  darker the color from farther away,  
it looks like gray  Four color separations and the  half tones are printed by screen then into dots   
The smaller the dots, the finer the resolution,  this is expressed in dpi, dots per inch    
Similarly, the resolution on computers  is expressed in ppi pixel per inch,  
the two are related  Generally, we need to save  photos as a double ppi of the dpi specified   
For example, many magazine quality publication  require about one hundred thirty three dpi called  
a one thirty three line screen  This means photo need to be saved at a  
resolution of two sixty six ppi to be of  acceptable quality  Publication on newsprint  
or other low quality stock are printed at fifty  five or sixty five line screens to avoid dot gain   
This is why they don't look as high quality  as those in magazines  “Dot gain” means that  
color harmony is sometimes is a pleasant to  the eye, so, it follows all the colors which  
as the ink soaks into low quality paper, it  get bigger, giving the photo a muddy look   
The ink must soak into lower quality paper to  allow it to dry quickly, because newspapers  
are quickly printed and distributed within  hours  Magazines often are printed on coat  
stock shiny paper that does not allow into ink to  soak, instead dries more slowly by oxidation   
This keeps the fine details sharp, but a  printer has to let the publication dry, because  
before it can be distributed  Consider  the color dot pattern at left,  
the higher the dot, the more  likely fine detail will be muddy   
This close up shows a color screening process   Note cyan atop yellow appears as green  Magenta  
on yellow appears orangeish red  The color  separate must be created and printed with  
a high degree of accuracy, to produce a quality  printed product, this requires skilled printers   
gets extracted in a single <?>wheel</?>   So, color harmony develop visual interest  
Recall that a piece of paper must be run through  an offset press four times to print process color,  
once for each print ink, plus black  If the paper is run through at a  
slightly different angle, the color won't overlap  properly  A color ghost may be seen on an edge,  
and color will be muddy  This is called  out of registration  Registration problems  
are particularly common in publication printed  and distributed quickly, such as newspaper    
In magazines and quality publication, graphic  artist and photographers may prefer to see  
proof copies of color separated to check  color quickly  They may also prefer to  
go to the printer at the beginning of a  run, to check color quality off the press   
Here from a recent Minneapolis  Star Tribune outstate edition,  
we see a major registration problem  It probably was fixed by the time the metro  
as a sense of order, in summer extremely unity  leads to under simulation extreme complex,  
edition appeared  We can say that color theory  can be related to color generated system or  
color harmony  Color harmony may be considered by  three hue, value and saturation  Hue is the name  
of the color, determined by the wavelength of the  electromagnetic spectrum  The Munsell color wheel  
sets up five primary hues: red, yellow, green,  blue and purple  The value of the degree of  
lightness or darkness of a color, in paint,  we mix black to dark a color called a shade,  
and white to light a color, called a tint  Saturation or intensity is a measure of the colors  
perceived purity or brightness,  Munsell called the chroma   
We can choose color harmony based on complementary  color on a color wheel  A color wheel  
guide a color choice as a described in  this YouTube video, so you have the link   
Some general guidelines for choosing  color: Difference will be emphasized   
lead to the over simulation  So, color  harmony is a dynamic equilibrium,  
For example, yellow surrounded by green will tend  to appear more yellow, green surrounded by yellow  
will tend to appear more green  This is the  rule of simulation contrast  Warm color appear  
to advance, cool color appear to recede  We can use this perception to add a feeling  
of dimension  Reds tend to dominate in a design   Research show the favorite color of most Americans  
is blue  Green in America is associated with  bitterness, brown is associated with maleness   
This means, for example, that sugar  will tend not to sell in a green packet,  
and women's cosmetics will tend not to sell  in a brown packet  When choosing spot color,  
consider a spot color for a graphic or clip  art  Consider a spot color for all headlines,  
subheads, drop caps, et-cetera  Create screened background using a spot color   
Keep your publication unified by choosing  a single color for all headlines,  
color theory in compress a multitude of  definition concept and design, applications,  
drop caps, et-cetera  You  can screen the color variety   
and have to field several encyclopedias   However, there are three basic categories  
of color theory that are logically are used  The color wheel, the color statics and the content  
of how color are used, color theory create  a logically structure of color  For example,  
Color theory is both the science and the art of  color, it explains how human precise color 
if we have an <?>assignment</?> of food and  vegetable, we can organize them by color,  
and placed them on a circle that shows  the color in related to each other   
Color of course, is simple visible wavelength  from the electromagnetic spectrum  Also a part  
of spectrum is infrared, ultraviolet, radio waves  and x-ray  Black is not a color  Black is the  
absence of color, obviously! But historically  people really did think black was a color   
Experimentally in physics proved that it would  be a false, Black nevertheless has strong  
visual weight in an image or design  Color  temperature is another vital consideration  
in design, by distinguishing between warm  color and cool color, a neutral color we can  
appropriately have the power to evoke emotional  response in people  Warm color are those which  
shades of Yellow and Red, cool color  have a Blue, Green and Purple tint,  
How color makes, matches or clashes? The <?>0:34</?>  and other cultural messages color communicate and  
neutral color include Brown, Gray, Black  and White  While these group holds true in  
a general sense emotionally response to color can  also be heavily affected by gender, experiences,  
cultural, associations and other people  Personal factors consequentially research  
<?>retrace</?> expectation of target  audience is vital, for not only fine  
tune the positive impact of color used in a  design, but also preventing design failure   
If you add all the visible wavelength  together, you will get white light   
We can prove this obviously by using a prism, a  prism separates white light in two wavelength   
So, a rainbow is simple as a prism of raindrops  separating sunlight into wavelength  White light  
actually has a slight color cast  This is due  to either the color temperature of the source,  
or the wavelength is missing  Higher temperature light is bluer,  
the method using to replicate color  So, we can  talk about color using two kinds of terminology,  
lower temperature is redder, so, the expression  in color temperature using the Kelvin scale   
This photo shows three different color  temperatures: the sunlight through the window  
is highest, the incandescent light shining  on the figure is warmer, the fire is warmer  
or lowest color temperature  Sunlight is  about five thousand five hundred degree  
Kelvin  Electronic flash is about  six thousand degree Kelvin, so  
slightly blue  Incandescent light is  about three thousand degree Kelvin, so  
orangeish  Candle light is about two thousand  four hundred degree Kelvin, so reddish   
Note the reddish cast to candle light,  compared with the bluish cast of a sunny day   
Some light is missing whole area of the spectrum   Fluorescent light, for example, is often missing  
warm colors, and so may look rather sickly  greenish blue  Of course, digital camera  
First, is the color generation system  and the second is the color harmony  
will adjust for color cast, to an extent  And we  can adjust it in Photoshop as we have learned   
Sometimes we do not want to talk the  color completely out of <?>context</?>  
however candle light should look warm  In  addition to color cast, graphic artists and  
photographers need to understand how color  is generated by machines  We used such as  
computer, television, and printing press  We generate colors in two ways - The additive  
system, the subtractive system  The additive  system begin with the absence of color, that is  
black, and add colors to that to reach the color  we want  It is based on three additive primaries-  
red, green, and blue, which is called RGB system   Additive colors is used in projected systems, such  
as television and computer monitors, and movies   Consider the computer monitor  A monitor projects  
color based on three "guns" of variable voltage   One each of R, G and B, the more intense the  
system  So, what is color generation system? So, the color generation system is the available  
voltage, the more intense the color projected  These voltages are expressed in numbers from zero,  
black or no color to two hundred fifty five most  intense color  Voltages are projected as phosphor  
(light sensitive) dots on a screen  Check  out computer screen with a magnifying glass,  
you will see all actually made of square  dots, called picture elements or pixels   
Obviously, zero and zero and zero  voltage will produce black, white two  
fifty five, two fifty five and two fifty five will  produce white  Other color depend on a combination  
of intensities of RGB  Keep in mind the color is  not actually mixed on the screen  It is either  
on or off, based on by its color or no color  Each pixel has a certain number of bits that can  
be display a color  Most modern computer monitors  can transmit the true color or twenty four bit  
color  This means each channel RGB contains  eight bit per channel that can transmit color   
color system are depend on the medium, with which  a designer is working  When painting and the  
Eight bits means the channel can  make eight combination of on or  
off of the color, per pixel, two fifty  six colors total  You have three channels,  
how many color can be generated? Two fifty six  into two fifty six, into two fifty six equals to  
one crore sixty seven lakh seventy seven  thousand two hundred sixteen possible colors   
Eight bit color also exists, two fifty six  color total  They are called “web-safe” color,  
because they are sure to render accurately  on anyone's monitor  Nowadays we don't have  
to worry about that much, below eight bit  and twenty four bit color are been there   
You also can have thirty two bit color,  even forty eight bit color  The last one  
has two hundred eighty one trillion color, far  more than the eye can scan  But, it is usually  
in some printing techniques, or so I have  read  Additive color is really handy in  
artist has a variety of paint to choose from and  mix color and <?>acrive</?> through the sub act  
projected applications  But it does not work in  printed application, that is, ink or paper   
Additive color won't work for printing because we  can't begin with black  We must begin with a piece  
of paper that is usually a white  White, as we  know is all colors, so we can't add to all colors,  
we must subtract  Furthermost, an offset  printing press can't generate the enormous  
number of color available on a computer screen   We need to run a piece of paper through the  
press for each ink  The press below has four  heads, one of each ink in CMYK system  The  
color system used by scientist and artists are  entirely different  An artist will makes blue  
and yellow paint to get a shade of green  A scientist will make green and red light to  
create yellow, the <?>painted</?> page in magazine  is yet another system  It is important to define  
the two different kind of color that we can see  in the world  As the first step is understanding  
color mentioned  When a designer is utilized  the computer to generate digital media, color  
color system, first there is the color that  you can touch such as the skin of an apple  
or a painted wall  These color are a part of  the sub space of an object, next there is the  
color you can’t touch, such as beam of light and  the color produced by your computer monitor   
Color generated by light are a part of the  color system, the tangible color, which are on  
the surface of an object or the printed page are  another color system  The following illustration  
and description define the different color system,  has a four head one of each ink in CMYK system   
The printed color, therefore, is  based on the subtracting system   
While the additive primaries used to generate  all colors are RGB, beginning with black    
The subtractive primaries are Cyan, Magenta,  Yellow and Black CMYK and begin with white    
Cyan blue-green, Magenta yellow-blue, Yellow red-green,  note the relationship between the additive and the  
are archived with the active color method  What  is color harmony system? It is the harmony which  
Hello, welcome to module thirty seven 
VFX is generally understood as the combination of live action footage and imagery created
outside the context of a live action shoot 
VFX shots range from basic image manipulation and compositing, integration of live action
with CG to full CG environments which look realistic 
Visual effects commonly aimed to create photo realistic and believable images 
The two most common VFX shots scenarios are, set extension and CG integration 
In set extension, we shoot the foreground on green screen and then extend the background set 
Whereas, in CG integration we first shoot the background and then integrate the CG objects 
Once of the VFX part is done, the foremost important aspect that is compositing comes
in picture 
In the previous class we had discussed science of colors, where we focused that understanding
In compositing we integrate our CG with the background live action 
The point one should consider while compositing is matching the colors, shadows, atmosphere,
sharpness, motion blur, grain and artifacts, lens distortion, et-cetera 
gamma, saturation, shadow mild tones, highlights, taking individual <?>paths</?>, et-cetera 
Shadow matching means tweaking the color, intensity and softness of shadows 
Atmosphere means adding foreground atmosphere elements such as very subtle smoke, light
wrap node, et-cetera 
Sharpness focuses defocusing the CG to match background 
Motion blur, an important aspect because camera motion creates motion blur, the amount depends
of color theory is essential for the science of animation 
on the shutter and the speed of the motion 
Render CG with motion blur or use of vector pass to create the motion blur in nuke 
Grain and artifacts that is matching the grain, compression artifacts and chroma effect, and
lens distortion refers to add the lens distortion node created by the camera <?>tracker</?>
to distort the CG 
So, let’s switch on to the application and the start the compositing 
Here in this module, we will be introducing about visual effect that is VFX and compositing 
VFX has advanced tremendously in last few centuries, the rapid advancement in the computer
graphics technologies and techniques 
In the late twentieth and early twenty first century gave those models, miniatures and
puppets a way to the world of 3D computer generated imaginary 
full 3D world 
﻿Hello everyone  So, in this session, we will  understand the concept of compositing inside After Effects    
then it will form a single layer and you can't  compose in After-Effects  So, I will not merge  
the layer I will just put separately  Okay  Now, what happens? See, if I go to Control again,  
we do the same process which we have did it  earlier  And we will press the ALT and go to Auto  
key and just go to the find darker and lighter  colours again, okay  One more thing we have to do,  
we will delete this part and we  will just off this because that's  
the reference thing which we want to do   So, I will just put it somehow at the centre  
and by holding Control and just click  over here, go to this part, Levels and  
by holding ALT, same thing which we have did it,  Find dark and lighter colour  Click over here,  
and I prefer to have manually adjustment  which would be better for me    
So, as you can see, I am doing the manual  adjustment and we’ll put some lighter colour here,  
one thousand also and also your image size will  change if you increase by five-hundred    
just drag this and we will make some amount of  darker  No problem  We will select both of them   
At first, we will select  both of them, will increase   
Sorry, we will click all of them, we will move  it somehow here and what else we will do?   
in that and we will save the file  So, as you  can see, we have created this amount of thing   
Now, we will switch to the next session and we  will add some more things in this, because we  
have the trees and this part, we have the castle  and this branch is also followed by the moon  
and some sort of different trees and also  the clouds  So, we will add more images and  
we will do the colour correction in the next  session  So, let's switch to the next session 
See, your image size changes to sixty-nine-point  two MB  So, right now, I am using  
three hundred resolution, okay fine  And the width  and height  So, I will change the width to sixteen  
and I will change the height to nine  So, I  will work in the landscape  So, we’ll open  
it  Okay  Colour mode RGB is fine  Eight bit  of colour mode, background is white, okay   
Image size is thirty- seven-point one MB  Okay  So, I will hit on okay  So, as you can see  
the blank image has formed, which is  the background and it is white    
And, I will open this lock by double clicking it  So,  as you can see, we have all the images inside  
this folder which is the Matte folder   So, I will put one by one  So, at first,  
I will take the cloud within which would be  the background of our matte painting  Okay   
So, as you can see, we have a couples  of different images which I have downloaded and  
So, I will just click the cloud and drag to the  Photoshop  Just put it over here  As you can see,  
if I just click here and just move and  want to increase the size you can see it's  
not increasing in proportional way  It's not  working in the proportional, so what I will do? I  
will just go to Control Z and just shift pressing  again and we’ll click one of the boundaries   
So, you can see now, it's working and also  increasing in proportional way, okay   
So, what I will do? I will press Enter  Now,  it has been set, so I will move it little bit  
upward, okay  So, make sure that you are  saving your file  So, I will save it; so  
Matte A underscore Zero Zero One,  okay  So, I will save it Matte A  Now,  
what else we have to do? I will just  right click and Rasterize the same    
What is Rasterize? As you can see here it's  forming the logo  So, you can't do anything as you  
most of them are PNG  So, what I will do? I will  make a quick matte painting inside Photoshop and  
can see, I have taken the brush, you can't even  paint it, okay  So, it will produce some error   
So, right now, what I will do? I will  just go to here and right click and  
Rasterize layer  Now, you can easily paint  or do anything you want in your photo    
So, okay, now we have set the cloud and  I will just use this one, which is the  
Plane Region  So, I will just put it somehow here,  no problem, okay  Now, what I will do? Rasterize  
the same, and I will use the Eraser tool, we’ll  increase the Opacity and I am using this soft  
Eraser  So, okay, by Bracket, which is just beside  the P, you can increase or decrease the size or  
even you can go over here to increase or decrease  the size  So, that would be hectic that means you  
have to just go over here and there  So, I think we should use the Bracket,  
which is beside P  So, I will just erase its  boundary part  So, I'm not using the Mask,  
we’ll turn that matte painting into After Effects  and just put all the images in After Effects   
I'm only using the Eraser, as you can see,  okay  So, this would be fine, I think, okay   
I will modify it laterwards  So, we’ll just move it  here and we have some garbage material also    
If I Off this, you can see the small parts  which is forming here  And one thing we have  
noticed that, this part we don't need it  So,  what I will do? I will just go to this layer  
and just go to the Clone tool  Here, we have  the Clone tool and what I will do? So, make sure  
that you are using the soft Clone Brush and if you  press spacebar you can move your image easily    
So, I will take the reference here  So, by taking  the reference you should have to press Alt, click  
and just paste the same reference  As you notice,  there is forming a plus sign over here, okay   
That means it's taking the reference  of that particular section  Okay   
So, I will just make some amount of background  thing like dragging my Clone tool here   
So, at first, I have to make the painting inside  the Photoshop with the help of these images   
So, you have to click and click like this way,  
okay  Make sure that you are saving  your file  That is very important   
Now, what I will do? I will go to nine  in a layer and we found these humans    
So, we will remove this  So, I will  put some background thing like,  
removing like this, and we’ll click and  we’ll just put some random thing, okay   
And, you have just putted some random  thing, and you see here, these are fine   
So, all the things are fine    
Okay  I have putted some random cloning   So, okay  What I will do? As you can see,  
the colour is not matching properly  So, we  have something over here, okay  Now, as you  
can see the colour is not matching properly   What I will do? I will just select this layer,  
So, I will create a scenery which is known as matte  painting  So, let’s get started  So, now I'm  
which is this one  So, by holding Control, I will  click over here  So, it will produce this kind of  
selection and now I will go to here   As you can see, by clicking over here  
you have the Levels, okay  So, I have to match the  colour  I will take the reference of this cloud   
So, as you can have this Auto, so, by holding  your Alt button  If you hold your Alt,  
you can click in the Auto  Now, a new window will  form, which has Auto Colour Correction option   
So, at first what I will do? I will just click  over here, find dark and light colours  As  
you can see, it changed quite well  Okay  Final graph also changed  And it's affecting  
your image also  You can switch, okay  Now,  I will take the shadow and we’ll choose that  
colour  I will just manually, I can manually  select that colour also, by moving somehow here,  
opening my Photoshop as you can see, I am using  CS six  Now, I will import all the image one by  
okay  Now, we will click the Okay   Save the new target colour as default- No,  
because I don't need that particular kind of  colour in Default way  So, right now, I am  
in RGB mode so you can select any of them  But, I  prefer to work in master, so I will just drag this  
and will, as you can see its matching quite well   And like this way you can match easily  Okay   
So, okay  Now, it's at the top  So, I will select  both of them by holding Control right click Merge  
Layers  So, the layers has been merged, okay   I will do Colour Correction laterwards in After  
Effect also, and we will save the file  Right  now, what I needed, I needed this this particular  
mountain and we will drag it to Photoshop and  just put it somewhere here  By holding shift,  
centre and now right-click Rasterize Layer  So, I will go to my Eraser tool and what I will  
one and I will set it according to my needs   So, I will go to File, New and we will go to the  
do? I will decrease the Opacity  So,  now I will just remove like this 
And okay no problem  Control T and move it little  bit downward, okay fine  So, as you can see,  
okay  I will just decrease the opacity a little  bit and just move like, okay no problem   
So, with this you can have a good understanding  how you can compose different images into one   
So, as you can see, we have just putted  this one and I will just off this level one,  
which we have created the ground and with the help  of this image, this one  So, I will just off this,  
because I need the background reference   So, again I will click on holding Control  
button  Click over here, you can see we have  selected this part and we’ll go over here   
So, here you have the Levels again  By holding  Alt and Auto, and Find darker and lighter,  
so shadow will be manually adjusted it,  because its better to manual adjust, okay,  
International Paper  Now, I will change it to  centimeters or inches will be fine  So, A Four I  
And we will ON this and just do the by clicking over  here you can have that particular section   
So, you can work quite well  Okay  So, by holding both of them,  
Merge layers  Okay, no problem  Now, what I will  do? I will just put some random clouds over here,  
but at first, I have to make the mountains  here  So, the mountains would be much more  
darker as compared to this one  So, we will  make some mountains with both of them    
So, we will take this one  and just put it somehow here   
So, that would be I think this part would be fine   So, what I will do? Right click, flip horizontal   
So, I will just put it somehow here   Okay enter, and right click, Rasterize   
And make sure that you will not merge all the  layers because, if you merge all the layers  
am using  As you can see resolution is three  hundred  As you can increase by five hundred, and  
﻿Hello everyone  So, in this  session we will add some more images  
Let's have a look and we'll change the level, same  because we have to match all the things which is  
coming across here  So, okay, one more thing we  have forgotten  So, I will just delete the same,  
do it again because we have to work in the  colour exactly  We have to work in the colour  
so that's very important, okay  So, now, we have  to define the colours  That part we have leaved   
Now, both of them selected by holding Control  merge layers  And if if you go this part,  
this is the blending mode  You can just switch,  and just use your arrow key, you can blend   
I think this part looks quite well and use the  opacity, little down  And also, one more thing you  
have to do  I will just select this part, isolate  the same  By holding Alt, you can click over here,  
all the things will be gone  So, I'm using the  Lasso tool and now I will increase my feather by,  
okay  Press Enter  I think, we  have to scale it a little bit   
I think five because we need some  amount of fader at its corner    
So, what happens? So, I will just remove  this part like, selecting all the parts like  
this random movement  Okay  You don't have to  work accuracy  If you are cutting the clouds,  
you can also have a random movement, okay   That would be fine, no problem  So, I will  
okay  Let's have a look, how we can fix this   Yeah, definitely we have to fix this  So,  
I will just remove this part because,  we don't need this part  And now, I will  
Yeah, it's working quite well  So,  
let's switch to the next  session because we have to add  
Now, what I will do? Right click, Rasterize  Layer, press Control, and click over here   
some more images here  I think one tree would be  fine and after that, we have to define the colour   
And the, yeah, the foreground thing would be  much more contrast and have darker colours and  
Control D, I just move it some over here   So, okay, control press and just go to  
the Levels, but at first, just off all  them  And we'll go to the Levels and just  
<?>repressing</?> Alt, which is same,  which we have did it earlier 
And, we'll take the colour like somehow here and  we'll take this colour to somehow here  Okay   
And we'll go to here and just move it  somehow here and just select both of them,  
merge layers  As you can see, these  layers has been merged  And  
After that, when we have done with placing our  images then we will do the renaming purposes   
in this matte painting  So, let's start   
So, what I have here, I have the clouds, which  is this one  So, we'll move one by one and just  
okay  I think, here this would be fine  and we'll move this like this way   
So, I'm stretching it, okay  No problem,  so I have to move the cloud like this   
So, we'll go to Eraser and at first, Rasterize  the same and will decrease the Opacity  
and we'll just randomly use  my Eraser to just randomly  
software  And this part also we need one cloud   So, I have another cloud, both are different  So,  
will decrease the size and we'll put somehow here,  
okay  That thing has the opacity level high   So, what I will do? I will just duplicate it,  
Now, what I will do, I will just go to my previous  folder, which we have taken the matte paintings, a  
control Z, only two times,okay, merge  layer  How you can duplicate? By Control J,  
you can duplicate easily or by clicking  and dragging into this copy layer and  
you can duplicate the same  So, there are  couple more different things to duplicate   
So, right click and duplicate layer   Here, you can have the duplicate  Okay   
So, like this way you can duplicate  I prefer  to duplicate with control J, this would be fine   
Okay  Now, what I will do? I will turn  the Opacity little bit down  Okay, fine  
and we'll go to the Eraser and we'll erase the  same, little bit of it, little bit of fadedness,  
no problem  This part needs, good and this  part need to be work, okay no problem  Okay   
Now, so we have this thing, this one  And  we will just put some trees over here 
So, what I will do? I will just go to that in  particular one and just put it one tree  I think,  
images which we have downloaded, okay  Now, I will  just select this part and we'll move to Photoshop  
this would look quite well  I think, if  I put it like this what happens? See,  
if I want to put like this  Is it work or not?  Let's have a look  Rasterize, remove all of them,  
control clicking, so I am doing the same  thing which we have did it many times,  
okay  So, we'll select the colour manually  that would be better and just going here,  
okay and no  We'll just drag this  down, we'll move this little bit    
So, we’ll ON all them, that would be  fine  As you can see, it's quite merging   
Make Merge Layers, Control S for saving   Now, this time we'll save in next version,  
which is the another version  So, Version is very  important  If you have just doing something and  
just your file gets crashed and you can go to the  previous version to have that particular data    
So, you don't have to work from starting  If you  don't make any version, if your file get crashed,  
and we'll keep somehow over here  So, what I  will do? Right click and flip horizontal    
everything will be gone  So, make sure that  you will make two or three versions  More  
than that, it would be better for you   So, so this way we have made and what else  
we have to do? I just want this part to be little  bit of fade, so, I will just, that means it just  
ejected from this mountain, like this way, okay   So, it's looking quite well now  And, we'll do  
one more thing  We’ll just put this castle,  and somehow here  So, we have to work out for  
Now, rasterize the same  And, if you have the  auto selection, then you can click any of the  
image it will directly go to that particular  layer, okay  If your auto selection is not on,  
that thing never worked  See, we have  selected this cloud  If you click,  
it will not go to that particular layer  So,  Auto selection by clicking and checking this,  
So, we'll press shift and just scale it down  a little bit  This would be fine, and  
you can just directly go to any of the  layer, okay  Otherwise what you have to do,  
right click the thing which come at the top  which that particular layer, right click  
level two, so like this way you can work  So, I prefer to work in Auto selection,  
that would be better  So, okay this part so, what  I will do? I will just go to the Lasso tool, by  
holding your left mouse button you can switch to  any of the tools by holding left mouse button    
So, I am going to Lasso tool  As this is a freehand  tool, as you can see, you can work like this   
Control D for de selection or if you are working  in polygon, that would be hectic if you have  
irregular shapes like this mountain   So, I prefer to have the Lasso tool and  
we’ll go and have the feather to around one,  so that its corners would be faded and have a  
good result  So, right now what I will do?  I will just off this castle for a while and  
we'll move it like this, and we'll rotate it    
go to lasso tool and just select this part like  moving like this  And what I will do now? I  
will just go and Control J for the same, but at  first, I have to select that particular layer,  
Control J and move it upward   So, as you can see, we have moved upward and  
the castle is hiding and what else we  have to do? Just move it somehow here,  
okay, that would be fine  And now we have to do  the tweaking  So, I will use the eraser and just  
work in the Opacity  So, we'll  just work in the Opacity   
So, I'm erasing in this part and after that what  else we have? We will just ease this part also   
Okay now, colour correction, we need to work  in the colour, that's very important  So,  
for that, what else we have to do?  This part is fine, oh that's creating  
double thing  So, we'll move it okay fine  And  now, we have to work in the colour correction   
So, as you can see, this part need to be work  out so Control T again  For transformation,  
So, we'll off all this  Only this one  is fine and we'll select this one,  
okay here we have the problem   
Control Alt Z, because we have just moved this  one also  So, we'll select this layer and just  
move it  Erase the same and right click twelve, by  holding Control again, we go to the same process  
Level  And by holding alt, click over here   Now, darker and lighter colour, click and just  
go to that particular colour, no problem   Select, go to that particular colour,  
I think mashed and okay fine  So, we have to work  in this part  So, what I will do? I will just  
erased this and Control S to save it again   And now, I will use this moon, so we'll drag this   
press shift and just move it  Okay, fine   As you can go here, your cursor changes,  
As you can see, this is not a PNG  image, because we have the background   
So, what else you have to do? We'll just keep  at the top and for a while Rasterize layer and  
we'll use this Ellipse Marquee tool, so with no  feather  I am using this Ellipse Marquee-tool    
If you hold shift, you have a particular and accurate  circle  If you leave your shift, you have a oval,  
yeah oval shapes, by holding shift   And, in space, where you can move your  
marquee tool by holding shift and spacebar,  okay  So, like this way, okay  Now,  
one more problem we have  If I delete this, then  the centre part will gone, Control Z  So, what I  
have to do? I have to do the inverse delete  So,  for that control shift and I  Control shift and I,  
and after that delete the same, control  D  So, we have do the inverse delete  So,  
I will put somehow over here  That would be  fine, I think, that would be work quite well   
as you can see, that's for rotating  purpose and just put it some over here,  
﻿Hi everyone  So, in this session we will  put some more images and will seriously work  
according to your need, or you can go to Window  and if you check, then that panel will be  
open here, okay  So, as you can see all the things  are here  If you just close this Render Coil,  
and if you go to Window and just open this,  it will directly come to your screen  Okay   
Paragraph, this is basically  for managing your typing thing  
into After Effects  So, it has some sort of  layouts and also it has some sort of parameters   
Effects and Pre-sets is very important, whatever  you want to take Effects  If you want to work in  
colour and if you want to work in 3D or even  blur or distort, you can go directly to here   
This is basically for typing purposes  So, this  will work with this one, basically paragraph   
Like this, you can just edit your  screen, have some more space, okay   
These are the tools and these are the  sub tools, which have all the things,  
okay  So, we will select both of them,  Rasterize layer and we will merge the same 
whatever you want to make in After Effect  Now, what happens? See, if I call all my images,  
I will just call all my images  And I will drag  this in After Effect, directly put it over here,  
you have to put it in the Project Window  So,  you can put all the images in the Project Window,  
or even the video, or even the Files, Compositing  files, After Effect will directly can take the  
Photoshop file also  So, it supports the Photoshop  file  So, you have all the layers and all the  
things  So, here you have the Effect Control, so  you can control your effects from this panel    
Now, what I will do? I will at first select  the Ground, so I know this is not my base,  
but I will first select the Ground  It's not  showing over here, because you have to drag on the  
timeline and now it is showing  As you  can see, whenever you just put it here,  
it form a new panel  This is for a sequence  This  is basically for sequence and composition    
So, we have both of them which has been merged and  now, we will select this by holding Control    
As you can see, here also you have the option Create  a new composition, that is the sequence and  
composition  So, it will just play like this   So, now it's playing two thirty seconds  If you  
hit on Spacebar, it will play  If you hit Spacebar  again, it will stop or you can go here  Okay   
By clicking away, it can play  like this you can go per frame,  
it will jump to the last and it will jump to  the first, okay  So, if you want to increase the  
timeline, so what you have to do?  Go to composition, here you have the  
composition and here you have the composition  settings  So, as you can see, we have width  
four thousand eight hundred pixels, and height  two thousand seven hundred pixels, okay   
You can change it according to your need  So, you have  the Pre-sets, you can work in HDV high-definition  
video or HDTV or even 4K or 2K  So, that's same  as that of premiere, but it has many panels  
Same, we will go to Level and just put it  the Alt and click it over here and just go to  
as compared to the Premiere  So,  if you're familiar with Premiere  
you can work in After Effect, quite well  So, I will show you the main features of the  
After Effect, because I will compose this scene   So, I will make this particular thing which is in  
2D form in Photoshop  So, I will just add some  depth camera and just put layers one by one, so  
you can see all the things  So, here,  you have the frame rate which is thirty   
Thirty frames per second, okay  Twenty-nine point  ninety- seven, you can decrease this according to  
your need, but that's the by default value  So, duration is thirty seconds  This  
is the time code and as you can see, this Zero  stands for frames  This particular section stands  
for seconds, this one for minute, and the last  one for hour  You can see over here also, okay   
Now, as you can see, we have Thirty  seconds  You can increase this  
find dark and lighter colour, so like this  way change the colour according to our need   
or even decrease this  If you need two minutes  thirty seconds, so now if you drag this, you have  
two minutes and thirty seconds   So, if you select any of the layers, it will  
highlight into lighter grey  As you can see, it's  only travelling two thirty seconds and after that,  
it will go on  So, what you will do? Click over  here, you can drag this like so  So, that's the  
feature of After Effect  So, by default I will  put thirty  I think, we don't require thirty  So,  
I think thirty would be fine, okay  You  can decrease this value, okay fine and we  
will just drag this to thirty   Now, I will just put at the ground  
I will just put this sky at the back  So,  you can see sky has formed  So, I have just  
go to the section  So, in After Effect also, or in  any other compositing software also you have to do  
the couples of adjustment  So, as you can see, so  I have just opened it for a quick look and now the  
And we will put some lighter colour over here   
mountain  So, I will put one by one, okay,  
no problem  So, my sky will go  little bit of above, I think here,  
this would be fine  So, I will do some  more adjustment later-wards  Okay   
Now, make sure that you are saving your file,  that's very important  So, I will save in Desktop   
I will save it Comping underscore Zero  Zero one  This is basically compositing  
tutorial  So, I have just putted the  mountain  Now, what I will do?  
I will just put the clouds, both of  them  At first, we will put this moon and  
so as you can see, whatever you  take, it will preview over here   
Okay  So, now we will click on  Okay and Yes, the darker colour,  
moon and the overlapping cloud  
just above the moon   So, as you can see, we have set up this scene and  
if I drag this, you will found all the things  lined up in a good way, in sequence way,  
okay  So, save it again and there is one more  switch  This is Toggle Switch modes  If we click,  
you may have the blending modes  As you know,  we have worked in blending modes many times and  
that's the blending mode  If  you want to go to this 3D view,  
toggle over here  Now, you have the  3D view  3D layer allows this layer  
to be manipulated in three dimensions   And also, you have the Motion Blur Effects,  
okay  Here, you have the Motion Blur Effects,  and this is the adjustment layer, okay  So,  
you can toggle your switches  This is basically  for Blending mode  If you blend this front tree,  
much more darker and just select both of them and  just merge layers  Control T and increase this  
it will definitely blend with the side rock  If  you blend the side rock, definitely it will blend  
with the cloud  Let's have a look  This is the  front tree  As you can see, if I click this, that  
part is selected and you can move easily at any  side of your screen, okay  And if I click over and  
go to screen now, you can see it's just blended  to the last one or it will show all the things   
So, by default normal would be fine and this  is basically for matte purpose, so we are not  
using this okay and this is basically for  linking purpose, that means parent to child  
this is basically linking  So, you have to  just drag or link any of them  As you can see,  
if you're dragging, there would be a message,  okay, click and just link any of them  But,  
we are not using  We will maybe  discuss it later-wards  Okay   
So, in this tutorial, we don't require these  types of things because we will work in 3D  So,  
size and after that, what I will do? I will just  erase this part  So, we will take the Eraser and  
I will just toggle the switch  So, you  can toggle your switch or even you can  
use your f four button on your keyboard  So,  you can toggle easily and switch your screen   
Now, we don't require to go to this particular  section because we don't need blending mode  
and matte things, track mat and the linking,  okay and also the parent linking   
So, we don't require it because we will work in 3D   Now, as you can see, your scene is being set up  
and what we will do now? We will just take some  more space  So, right now, we have to produce the  
camera  So, what I will do? Right-click, New and  Camera  So, as you can see Pre-set is fifty mm,  
fifty millimeter  If you click over  here, you will have all the Pre-sets   
So, I am using fifty millimeter because I need  the screen to be in straightway like this    
As you will go to fifteen millimeters, it  will produce some bulge effect  If you go  
to two hundred millimeters, it will produce some  curve effect  So, I will put fifty millimeter,  
which is by default angle of view  thirty-nine point sixty  Okay  We  
don't require <?>the depth </?>and  lock to Zoom, okay fine, okay   
It's showing the warning because camera  and light does not affect 2D layers   
Now, these all are in 2D  I will put never again,  okay, no problem and we will put all the layers  
into 3D  So, as you can see, we have created the  camera and at first, I will save the file 
Now, at the top we are in Selection tool  So,  we will go to Camera, okay click, okay   
Now, with the help of your  left mouse button, you can just  
rotate  So, you have a dedicated Rotation tool  also inside your camera  If I click over here,  
you have this Orbital Camera tool  So, you can  orbit your and if you go here, by click over  
and we have to focus on the back part   So, I will just select the Level one, click over  
in this particular section, which is the  background  So, I will just put some much  
here you have, Track XY camera tool  Okay  So, as you can see it's buffering quite well   
So, that's why what I will do? I  will just set this full to quarter   
So, it will just have some pixelate value and  after that you are satisfied with the work,  
you will directly switch to full, okay  So, what  it will do? It will pan up your whole scene  Okay,  
and then, we have track Z camera, it will  zoom in and zoom out  So, that's the main  
thing of camera  Okay   So, right now, I'm using this one,  
Orbital Camera tool  So, as  you can see, no problem, okay   
So, as you can see, if I go to full, then it  will buffer because we are in full resolution   
If you move little bit, then also it will buffer   So, instead of using full, I will go to quarter  
and when we are done with it, then we will switch  to full and have a render  So, what happens now? I  
here and make a new layer and just put this colour  in this one control D and we will change the  
will just delete this camera again and just  make a New Camera, okay, rest is fine    
And now, instead of having one view we will  go to two view or you can have four view  But,  
that would be confusing  If I click over here, you  have all the things in 3D way like Maya  So, this,  
you can say this is the Perspective, this  is the Top obviously, this is the Front,  
this is the Right   So, we required only two,  
so that would be fine  So, we have Top and Active  Camera  So, what I will do? I will just give some  
depth between them  As you can see, this is the  Camera View and this is the Top view, okay  So, I  
will just select this sky  As you can see, we have  to access, this is the Z and this is the X   
We will put this sky at the  back  Later-wards, we will manage  
the size  This is the ground, so we  will just put the ground at the back,  
mode to, okay  We will turn  the opacity down little bit,  
the overlapping cloud, we will put somehow  here  This is the mountain, go to the back   
This is the cloud, goes somehow  here  This is the second cloud,  
put somehow here  This is the side rock,  
okay and this is the front tree  So, we will  just put somehow here, this is the front tree   
Now, as you can see, we have set  up the gap between them and we will  
just press shift and select all  of them and we will move further   
Okay  We will just move it downward little bit   Now, if I select My Camera,  
as you can see, we have selected my Camera   That's the camera, and that's the focusing point   
So, what I will do? I will select my  camera  Instead of moving from here or here,  
what I will do? I will go to  here and just drag Z camera   
Click and move  As you can see, it will just  produce some amount of depth between them   
So, right now, what I will do? One more thing,  I will go to zero second and what I will do?  
I will just open this, you have the Transform,  click over here  If you just drag this, you will  
find that position is changing  Okay no problem,  it would be changed  So, what I will do? I will  
click over here  This is for animation purpose   Click, now particular key has formed and in  
fifteen seconds, even in ten seconds, ten  seconds would be fine  It will go to   
So, make sure that the black region will not  come  It will not look good  So, we will just  
drag this, okay  So, as you can see,  now you have some amount of depth   
you can do it from here  Just zoom it and you can  have that frame  So, you can go directly and just  
zoom out a little bit   So, one more thing you can do, you can select your  
key and just move  If you want to move, you can  move to fifteen seconds or even more, if you  
need  Or even if you select both of them,  you can move directly like this, okay   
Control Z and because that would be fine  So,  I think we have to switch to the next session 
let's have a look   So, I'm using the Arrow button,  
will turn the opacity down  We  will put this thing here also   
So, I'm making a new layer, Alt  Backspace Control D and Linear dodge,  
I have to match the background  So,  that's very important  Same with the tree,  
more darker colour and will just select all  the things which is at the background and just  
So, we will select both of them, we should  decrease the colour intensity  We will select  
this and decrease the colour intensity and  also decrease colour intensity here, okay   
Okay rest is fine  I think rest is fine  We  have to work for the same  Now, as you can see,  
part to be little bit of more darker   So, I will go to the Levels  This time,  
I will just move this little bit, and you can find  that it's affecting quite well, okay, no problem   
So, we will select both of them, merge layers   Now, we have to merge the layers which we have  
created like this particular colour   So, we will select both of them, Merge   
So, we will select both of them, Merge  Okay  And now we will just  
use some dull colour  So, let's start   Now, what I will do? I will just go to my  
do one more thing, Rename the same  So,  this would be Sky  This would be the Ground,  
and this would be the Mountain  centre and this would be the Cloud,  
So, okay, we have to merge  these things to the Tree also   
Merge and now, we will merge the  Castle, followed by this part   
So, we will select all of them, Merge the  same and we will just move it over here   
We will Merge the same that would  be a particular thing, okay    
So, Mountain, fine  So, this would be the side  part and this would also be the side part    
folder which we have kept  So, as you can see  here, we have some sort of trees also  So, I just  
‘m o o n’ - Moon, and this would be the Cloud,  
overlapped cloud  And that  would be the Tree, front tree   
So, I will put this tree over here  So, what  I will do? I will just select this tree,  
and put it over here  So, as you can see it's  hiding  So, no problem, we will select both of  
them  Merge layers, so we have this thing and we  will just select this one, overlap Cloud and Moon  
and we will put some more at the last, okay   Not so last, but I think here  Okay   
So, one more thing we have to  do  We will just select the  
Eraser and just remove some of these parts   So, define, and just select this part,  
move, okay fine  So, as you can see, this would  be the Front  This would be the Side front, this  
that's the Ground and that's the Sky  So, we have all the things which we have make  
it  And now what I will do? I will just select  each and every part and we will start doing the,  
yeah, we will start rendering one by one in  PNG, so that you don't have the background,  
you just have only the images  So, the  background would be transparent    
Now, what I will do? I will just  select one by one and just move   
So, I have this sky, so one more thing I have to  do  I just put this Sky like here, and we will go  
So, that should be in JPG, because it's an  overlapping image, no problem  Okay, fine   
Now, we will take the ground of this, okay   Make sure that you will off all the things  
not work  So, I will take it, another one  So,  I think, this one which we have take it    
And one more thing you have to do  We have to  do some amount of tweaking in our compositing  
software also  That means we have to play with  the opacity in our compositing software    
That would be the centre mountain,  it’s saving right now  So, Mountain,  
PNG,  
few more to go,  
Save As, Side rock   
So, we have to take the PNG, Save,  and last one this one, Front Tree   
So, as you can see, we have saved all the  things in PNG and we have this thing in JPG  So,  
So, we will just change the Flip Horizontal and  also, we will put it somehow here  Okay   
you can say images, but I'm using that amount of  images, as you can see  We have some bushes also,  
you can use it according to your need  But I think  that would be fine  So, now, I have just rendered  
this  As you can see, we have all the data which  is rendered in PNG except this one  This is the  
JPG and now what I will do?  I will open my After Effect,  
okay  So, now I will compose my shot in the  After Effect  So, I'm using After Effects CS6,  
and what I will do? I will just call each and  every images one by one, and we will start working  
in the After Effect  As you can see, the After  Effect has been opened, and you are watching the  
graphic user interface of the After Effect   So, this is by default the graphic user interface  
of the After Effect  So, whatever you want to  make, it will show on the Compositing screen   
This is the Composition screen, and here you have  to call your projects or images or even videos,  
So, now what I will do? I will just press Alt  and just move it here  So, have duplicate copy  
okay  And this would be your timeline and  it's a layer-based software like Photoshop   
That means Photoshop has the layer like  this and same After Effect have layer    
So, we will discuss this and this step basically  for render, that means final output, okay   
We will have a look in this also, and here we  have the Effect and Pre-sets  You can drag this  
and you found more things, this is for Preview,  Play Forward, Play Backward, Play per Frame,  
Go to the last, Go to the first and that all   So, this is the basically, Colour mode and this  
is basically the Audio Channel  So, After  Effect is not basically for audio editing,  
it's basically for compositing  But, still you  have the freedom to examine your audio    
But you can't edit the audio  You have audition, Adobe  Audition which is completely different software  
and it's only working audio  Okay  So, you can off any of the panel's  
and we will Flip horizontal   Let's put some over here,  
What is look development?
of lighting the director’s mind 
Regardless, once in lighting try to separate the light setup in the passes as long as have
the light sources 
It will save up a lot of time doing multiple iteration very quickly without having to re-render
the whole scene 
Lastly, start simple and keep it simple as long as possible 
No need to overcomplicate setups, if you are able to get the desired look in simple ways
of course, it varies from production to production 
However, the aiming should be on getting desirable looks in shortest amount of time 
If you achieved keeping it simple, then the next department in pipeline will be really
Have direct relation to each other helping to deliver the mood and emotion into the audience 
grateful to you 
Thanks, hope you understand the same, let’s switch to the next session 
If either of them changes, it affects the look of the other one 
Generally during this stage is sign or asset could go through many <?>alliteration</?>,
such as change in color refraction, different lighting setups, so on and so forthly 
Finally, it is the ones director hands to select a look among all the provided option 
What is covered inside the look development?
Let’s consider two main look development phases 
The 2D and the 3D, as they complement each other, because each one is done easier in
certain ways, while serving different needs, during the 2D process which take is prior
to the 3D one 
In the live action VFX or CG productions, there is always a need to explore potential
It is important to experiment with different color, shapes, atmosphere and placement of
lights searching for various mode, that together can help telling a story 
Nevertheless, one thing to keep in mind in shot continuity while doing look development 
Eventually, it defined how mood shift from one scene to another a single shot, or as
it could end up having multiple painted versions which is shown in the direction to the director 
So, that he or she can better emphasize certain looks and then decide which way to go 
The More the look development process, the more delay it can be get 
Let’s say from overall tools all the way to atmospheric effect such as haze, volume,
rays and et-cetera, causing a look development gradually getting developed 
Through this stage the details should be just enough to convey the ideas and the feeling
looks a scene or object could have to ensure the final product in both story, and aesthetics
without getting to elaborate 
Moving to a 3D look development, it is commonly began by experimenting with asset shading 
This is where the different materials for different part of the object get constructed
and evaluated, under various lighting condition 
Thus, having real world references is keen in achieving possibly result 
It can be images or actual footage of a certain material to be able to study in more detail 
Finding out its characteristics- there are many brief models out there, the popular one
of those is CG effects distributes, where does a <?>3:32</?> specular deals happen on
real world metallic 
Material as an explanation establishes shader setting for a metal material, which is reflected
will look its best 
described its physical behavior 
Not only required set to have a proper brain model, but also does it need to be <?>led</?>under
a decent environment to accurately get evaluated 
Similarly, just like 2D work flow, the texture and the shader only need to have enough general
details, to illuminate the feeling 
The idea is simply doing multiple illustration quick in order to explore different potentialities 
Now, this can get extended to lighting to complement the look development process 
The previous work both on 2D and 3D would get sent to lighting and all according to
that the couple of exploration, and revision take place to visualize possibly mode and
emotion through lighting 
Look development could have different meaning in various <?>pace</?>, but it is the notion
Words mentioned all this look development phase can go faster enough to have the development
process, getting circulated inside the team rapidly 
When should somebody start a look development on a project?
As soon as the director shares the thought and the concept act on the look of the project 
Be in the film or the game or the commercial with them to be team look development department
would get together to start 
Brainstorming ideas how to achieve the director’s vision and be able to provide <?>5:12</?>
her with early design as soon as possible 
It is essentially to find the right time with manageable team timeframes to assure every
revision and update and can get delivered in time 
of how the project will look and feel like in the end 
Having said that during early stage it is mainly the 2D team that is unity, 3D model
and create and refers provide to be sent to the 3D team 
Once provided with the 3D model different shades variation gets created to be shown
to the director 
Likewise, the same process is valid for lighting 
At first glance, it may seem like a sequentially process which is corrected for initial phases 
However, by the time all pre-request are prepared such as early concept, models, shade and so
on 
The whole look development would be able to have quick back and forth internally, in order
to refine output as much as possible 
In fact, anything in production that rapidly interact through faces of achieving special
Supposing, the director is happy with the latest progress and general look over different
shots; the material can be finalized by the <?>more</?> focus department, such as the
shading and the lighting team 
Each studio tends to do the different for instance one place rather final shades gets
established right with the look development, because they already considered look development
as a shading team 
Another studio has decided shading due which zero in on the texture, color and material 
When somebody do the look development process, the first thing to keep in mind is color space 
It is much product topic but to just hint it at, it is critically the colors space be
strength the whole time is change in pipeline color space in the middle of the road 
look can be called look development 
Whether the scene referred or display referred could cause many issue, and sent incorrect
look to final product 
The least thing to do is refine all the texture and shader for matter are in linear space
before fade into the render 
Renders calculate and such calculation never consider nonlinear inputs 
To further emphasize previous points, it is necessary to provide various versions rapidly,
ensuring everything is going on the right track constantly 
Otherwise, you may find you yourselves speeding in a lot of time and energy creating something
that may eventually get ruled out 
Continuity between shots definitely need to be high importance as well, a transparent
It could range from speeding painting ideas on paper, all the way to <?>rapid</?> explanation
object might work well under certain lighting 
But, the exact same material might fail to deliver the right look due to lacking certain
parameters being work on already such as glass roof all through the material are getting
tested under varying lighting condition 
Please sure you are consider all sort of possible lighting <?>senior 8:06 </?> are going to
be set in production 
This will help you make shader more stable and accurate through the production 
Regarding lighting continuously factor can get plenty help from 3D look development to
a large extent 
Because, those one have already passed direction approval and pretty much represent the type
of 3D models shading which is more common known as look development and lighting 
﻿Hello everyone  So, in this session we will  do the more blocking into Autodesk Maya  So,  
already implemented into the character and  all the things is being renamed quite well   
So, whatever you does, you will go to the channel  box to have a particular section of your view  okay  
So, like this way you can work quite well and  also make sure that whenever you are working in  
a particular scene or any data you should always  use to do you can say some version saving   
So, that if something went wrong  you can go to the previous version  
to have an update of the same  So, this is the  belly region of the character, move like this and  
also we have some sort of translate Z value,  just move like this and this is the feet region  
and also move here somehow here and after that  you have the character proportionate which is  
also been seen into the reference  You can say the  larger part which is at the grid is known as the  
full controller of the character  If you move the larger part from the  
start and end key which is twenty-four  frames per second and also we just have  
grid definitely whole character  will move from its mean position  Okay  
Like this way you can work for the same and  
timeline, twelfth frame, you can have the leg  region and also here the all minus twenty-two  
and you can just change the value because  it’s getting distorted, so like this way  Okay  
So, right now I will just go to the toe lift and  here we have just putted some values into the toe  
lift which is just below the computer screen at  the right side on your screen into the channel  
box  So, at first now I will just go to the  downward region as you can see  If you just move,  
the foot region will remain in its own  position because we have just setted the  
I K and F K that’s why and you can just select  this controller and just go to this stretch,  
one X of height and four X according to  your need  So, you can change the timeline  
so you can stretch it easily  As you can see its just moving  
into the scale value with the help of  stretch you can just have the values,  
you can just putted the value into the stretch you  can have extra manipulation key  And also you have  
the heel lift so you can just easily lift  up your heel into your model and also  
you just have this part which is the pelvis region  of the character  So, you can just give the weight  
because if weight will not been there it will  not look realistic, so much of more realistic   
So, this heel region which is the heel part  so at first as you can see the heel region  
have the translate value and also  have the rotational value  So,  
you don’t require the scale value, right now  we’ll just put some values into the heel lift   
So, as you can see we have just putted zero right  now, and just putted zero to its mean position   
parameters with the help of preferences  okay, So,  here you have the key thick sizes and you can just  
Because if you just have  the minus value it will go  
upward because it’s going against the gravity  So, minus happened only when you are just putting  
the value into the gravity  As you can see  there is a jerk between the footsteps  So,  
we have to just decrease the jerk level because  we have to add certain key frame  So, that jerk  
will never been produce and also we just have to  manipulate few of the curves into the character   
As selected the character which is the  rotate y axis and we’ll just putted  
some amount of minus value which is a shift  with the character to its mean position   
And rotate minus x four will be  there at the rotate x and also  
we have the value of Z which is zero  So, now  the character is facing towards the front   
As you can see its moving constant so we  don’t require the constant motion    
increase the value accordingly and also you can  just have the all values which is the increase  
So, what if else we have to do, we’ll just  putted some of the values into the  
So, right now I am just focusing on the top part   So, this is the shoulder region and  
this all will just by holding control and shift  you can just have a particular right click paste,  
you can paste your key frames into any of the  particular part, you just have to just select that  
part and you can just paste it accordingly  okay So,  right now as you can see the shoulder region and  
this part especially attached with the shoulder  curve, so if you manipulately rotate this section,  
it will definitely just have a particular  look at your just like this way  Okay   
So, you can just manipulate the curvature of  the model and also you will just move it like  
this and also you will just select and just move  it like this  So, like this way you can manipulate  
pending frames  So, like this way you  have this part which is activated and  
the full character and also you just look at the  character and if you just look at the reference,  
you will find a huge amount of changes also  But if you just have a video sequence that  
would be much more better because if you just  record yourself with a camcorder or mobile,  
if you just put that video into your  computer and just look at around and just  
do the animation, followed by a video, so that  will generate a huge amount of you can say  
realistic into your animation  So, like this way  you just have to animate it accordingly  Okay   
Now, again it is stiff because we have to do the  blocking, so we don’t require extra keys but yeah  
still you can work for the same at few frames you  have to do the correction, you have to work hard  
for the few frames, after that you will do the  cycling or the looping step  okay So, that means  
a few frames will be the hard method or you can  say the manual method, after that you will just  
key ticks and the channel box   So, you can select between key ticks  
put the cycle loop, which will just allow you to  just animate that thing in a particular loop   
So, like this way you can animate all the things  inside Maya software, so you have to just have  
the reference, you can have the idea  If you are  immature or if you are a beginner then definitely  
you need some references because if you just  look at the reference, and animate the character  
accordingly then it will be much more better  So, if you are professional, you can use your own  
idea that which part is moving and which part will  not move, which part will go against gravity or  
with the gravity, so like this way, if you are a  professional definitely you can do it by yourself,  
otherwise you can take the reference  or you can just record yourself for  
animation purpose and it would be much  more better that you can record yourself  
and have the animation on your computer   So, here we have the ball lift and here we  
channel box and activated and here you have  the key text sizes  So, you can increase the  
have the translate  So, I'm just putting  seventy-five into the translate, hundred  
would be fine and I think one twenty-five  would be better and after that we’ll just,  
as you can see there is a mistaken, so we’ll just  move this controller and also this controller    
So, now you can find that the mistake has been  gone because that thing is getting distress, so  
if you just move this thing the mistaken  will be gone  So, now I just select the  
whole character and just move it somehow  here and copy the thing and just paste the  
remaining key frame into the last  one  And after that if you just switch  
definitely you will get a huge animation because  the character is following the loop  And if you  
paste any key definitely the character will behave  as your key, whichever you have just pasted   
So, now here we have the translate  which I will just put it hundred   
sizes or decrease the sizes, so I just put it  to and here you have playback  Playback would be  
No, not needed, I think translate Z would be minus  hundred  So, the rest position will start from  
here and also we’ll just go to the graph editor,  so graph editor is very important as we have also  
discussed in the bouncing ball that graph  editor and dope sheet is very important,  
it has all sort of curves which is situated at  the top as you can see these are the tangent,  
these are the tangent, which have some amount  of curvature in it that will allow you to  
work in a detailed animation view  So, graph editor is very important and also it has  
point that will allow you to just give the curve  to its key frames  Between key frames you can add  
extra key frames in the graph editor also  Okay If  you are not using the timeline, definitely you can  
use the graph editor to add some more key frames,  okay like this way you can work for the same   
As the character is moving forward and I just  open the graph editor, here the line is linear  
continuous, no problem and after that you  have the oscillation and once, so there would  
and it has two key frames between you can add  or you can also manipulate through tangent  
changes  So, as you can see the character is  moving in one second which is the twenty-four  
frames per second, which is in PAL  So, right  click and just click on the slant tangent,  
it is moving in a robotic way as you can see  Okay The character which is not forming the any wave  
kind of motion which is robotic motion and after  that if you just do the curve into your tangents,  
definitely it will form some amount of naturality   So, we’ll look the graph editor in a detail way,  
so at first we have to check the animation,  as you can see we have in between frame,  
which the two are the blocking and this  is the you can say refinement  Okay  
So, refinement is very important in between frames  you have to just put some amount of frame, so that  
the blocking or the robotic motion will be  gone and you will have a detailed animation  
be a real time, so I just using twenty-four  frames per second which is the real time   
as you can see we have the character and after  that we’ll just start the blocking process  
you can say animation view  Okay, With the help of  this you can change your character animation 
So, here we have the undo and undo infinite okay  fine, and these all are the panels which came  
across in the preferences  So, you have to look at  one by one into each and every panel, so whatever  
you want to change you can change from here, it  will directly updated on your view port  Okay so,  
rest are fine I think display animation is okay   I will hit on save so the part has been saved   
So, right now we have the setting inside the  timeline and also you have the character,  
so here you have the new shelf and I  will just do the enter new shelf name,  
so I just put it the name of the character Mary  and after that we’ll just do one more thing is  
that we start working on the tweaking process  So, just select this part and here we have  
we have the all selected thing which is  been added inside the self menu of our  
inside Maya software  So, right now we will  just do the blocking inside Maya software and  
scene  So, each and every panel have its own  <?>important</?> value  So, right now what I  
will do, I will just go to the character setup,  as you can see it’s moving forward it has the  
dark region which is the left leg you can say  And now we’ll just follow this animation  
as you need the reference if you are working in  the animation  Inside Maya you definitely need  
the reference, so here would be the top view and  here would be the front view and here would be  
the left view  So, reference management is very  important, you should need at least references,  
okayay so that nothing would be getting problem,  so you may have a good and refine animation  
with the help of the references   So, we’ll select both the shoulder region  
and you can rotate it accordingly, as you can  see each and every controller is being defined  
with the polygons quite well okay  So, as you can  see just drag this into the downward region and  
we will just manipulate each and every part  one by one  So, right now what I will do,  
after that we’ll select the feet region and here  I'm just move it little bit at the back region, so  
right now I'm just starting the blocking process  as in the right hand side in the channel box you  
will found the transparency which is minus, I'm  just putting minus twenty-five, okay fine   
So, this part, this region which is the left  leg, so just put it the translate Z value  
So, inside the perspective viewport,  so I will just rotate the step  
and after that we’ll just select this part and  just see that it is working quite well or not,  
yeah definitely it will work  And as you can see the left, right leg  
and we’ll just have the channel box where you can  have all the things which is renamed properly, so  
renaming is very important and you have  to look at the reference one by one  
I have the timeline which is set to one twenty,  I will just decrease the value to twenty-four,  
so that whatever you will make, you will have a  good and refined animation into your reference  Okay  
With the help of reference, you can achieve  a proper and good result that is much more  
beneficial to work with the reference  So, as you can see this leg is moving at  
the front area and we have the ball lift and  after that if you just go to stretch and you  
can just put the value of stretch and you can  just put it some amount of stretch value, so that  
it will just stretch your whole animation  process  And also all things is renamed  
properly that means we’ll not get any confuse  So, renaming is very important in your animation   
So, if you are renaming, well you can have a  good animation, so you will not get confuse  So,  
whenever you are saving a file or doing  something, you should have a proper rename  
of your animation  So, with the help of this,  you can have a toe lift and also you have the  
so I will need only one, one second    So, right now it is in PAL and if you are  
values, you can just manipulate it  Okay  So, you have the heel lift, you can easily  
lift the heel like this way and also by  middle mouse button you can drag the values,  
So, you may have the idea, how you are just  putting all the values into your character  Okay So,  
after that when the blocking process will be over,  we will start working on the graph editor which is  
very detailed and we’ll discuss this graph editor  laterwards  It have some sort of curvature,  
tangent and points  You can easily manipulate  all the things inside the graph editor   
So, with the help of like this way you can just  put it your animation in a very good manner  
every controller had to be animated because this  is the character and if a character is moving,  
each and every controller has its own  <?>importancy</?>, so with the help of  
working NTFS definitely it will go to thirty, thirty frame  per second  So, this is your timeline and you can  
Select all these fingers and just move it  like this and select this one moving like this  
and select this, this region move  it like this, this and this one  Okay  
With the help of this one you can  have a proper flow of your animation  
and this finger would be like this because  this is an organic character and each and  
every step has to be animated quite well  So,  you have to just animate it accordingly   
And after that when the animation gets over,  you have to just do the play blast which is a  
dummy render or you can say the rough render, so  we will discuss this play blast in laterwards,  
okay like this way you can just manipulate  all the things inside your Maya software   
And as you can see the hand region is rotating  quite well and also we’ll just select all the  
just run across your timeline and you can just  decrease the value or increase the value according  
things like having animation  like rotating along its axis and  
also we’ll just select this part and just  move it like this and just rotate it   
And also we’ll just select this part, move it  like here, select this part move it like here, and  
the proper flow of animation can be seen into a  reference, if you are working into a reference,  
you can have a better look at how you are just  manipulating all the things inside your software   
So, with the help of this thing I can just move  quite well, okay little bit of more space to have a  
clear look and also we'll just select this part  and just move it forward and also just do the  
contrast region and here  just move it like this  Okay  
So, these things should be bend and  also these things should be rotate  
and after that we'll select this finger and  just move like here  And also we'll just the  
to your need  I just opened the auto key, so  that each of every key will be automatically  
torso region which is the shoulder part, we’ll  somehow here  So, the proper rotation is very  
important into the character, that means if  you are working into the character walk cycle,  
you have to just work in the particular  character each and every part okay one by one    
So, moving like this and also just select and  just rotate like this way and also the palm region  
shoulder and just move backward, just select this  particular shoulder panel and one by one you just  
have to just move like this  okay So, the proper  movement of a particular character according to  
the timeline is very important, you can just move  it like this way and also you just follow the shoe  
region which you have manipulated  So, that means the character have all  
the data which into the curve, that  means you have the curve data which  
generated and here you have the preferences  So, now the time slider which is the animation  
﻿Hello everyone  So, welcome to this course of  animation  So, as you can see we have done the  
for a while and also this one  So, as you can  see now we can change the part of this hand  
into the rotate Y, so at first we’ll just off  the translate values into slant  So, we don’t  
require curvature into the translate value, but  in rotate Y can have the manipulation of points   
So, select and rotate Y and just  select and just move it like, like this,  
so that it will form a particular curve loop  Select this and move it somehow here and also  
select this and move it somehow here  So, as you  can see it is forming a particular loop into your  
graph editor, and also just move it somehow here   So, little bit of shipment is very important,  
that means you don’t have to shift like this, just  look at your animation into the timeline, just  
proper flow to the timeline and also check out  each and every part is moving quite well or not   
Then after you need something to do into the graph  editor, you can shift the points accordingly  Okay  
working into the walk cycle or any of the  character animation, you need the curviness   
So, with the help of this, you may have the idea  how you can just change into the graph editor,  
and how you can just manipulate it each  and every process into the graph editor   
Put it like here and also will just select  this hand, select this part and move it here   
Select this one, move it at the downward  region, and also this part need to be  
rotate Y, I think rotate Z would be fine   And this part which is the rotate X, and  
the head region of the character,  
the neck region,  
click all the curvature, and minus fifteen  So, it’s just gone down as you can see a  
That means if you add the curviness, it will  produce some amount of more realistic    
this way is important, and also we just working  in the rotate value as compared to the translate  
one  So, we are working more into the rotate  values because whenever any character is moving,  
the rotation value will have to be changed well   okay So, this way you can have the proper idea that  
how your character is moving well, and also  how you can change the rotate value inside  
the character  So,  
the shipment of the graph editor and followed by  the timeline, whatever you does into the timeline,  
it will all show into the graph editor  That  means in graph editor you will have the detailed  
view of your timeline  So, I am in playblast  option, you can just have the custom display,  
and I think size would be reduce, because  playblast is only for having your rough view  
amount  So, six forty, three twenty is fine, scale  is one and frame padding would be four  Okay So,  
So, better you should have a reference and after  that if you watch to the reference, just copy that  
where you want to save your playblast file, you  have to just define your correct directory   
So, I will just select any of them and make sure  that whenever you are working in any of the file,  
you should always have to rename accordingly  So,  that if you have the proper rename, you can go to  
your file easily, okay so rename is very important   And also whenever you want to save your file,  
please make sure that all file will save  in a particular folder of that particular  
scene, which you are creating into the Maya  So,  you don’t have to put in each and every drive,  
you have to save in only one folder  So,  that whenever you are working, you just  
call that particular drive  So, as you can see we have  
yeah we have just opened the playblast window,  which is floating window, and also when your  
same animation, you will just get little bit of  more realistic  So, there should be a weight on  
will minimize the same and will go to the  perspective  Each and every time I am working  
more in perspective, because in perspective you  can easily change your screen, or you can rotate  
and you can watch every every you can say every  angles  So, instead of having in all the view,  
you can also work in the perspective if you  need, but, you have to check in every view  Okay  
So, checking in every way especially in  front and the left view is very important   
After that you can work manipulate your  animation into the perspective, and again  
you have to look at your perspective Sorry you  have to look at your left and front view  Okay So,  
changing of your view is very important, you  don’t have to fix in only one view  If you  
want to work in left view, if you have worked in  left view, definitely in front view or perspective  
view things will not been matched  So, each and  every time you have to switch on your view  Okay   
the feet, so that when character is moving  forward and it’s just tapping to the ground,  
So, whatever you have done in front view,  you have to look at in the left view,  
and after that you have to manipulate all  the things into the perspective  Because in  
perspective view, you may have the camera,  you can easily rotate the camera around the  
model  So, as you can see graph editor we have  opened the graph editor and just selected all  
the panels of this particular character, as you  can see its gets messed  So, like this way artist  
gets confused because if you open all the things,  you can’t work  So, instead of having opening all  
those, you can have only one thing at a time  So, as you can see I am just does the post  
infinity, so that the cycle will happen, each and  every time your thing will be into animation    
So, post infinity, linear or you can use this  cycle, so like this way you can work 
So, that your animation will follow one by one, one by  one in each and every frame by itself, you have to  
some amount of weight can be seen  Okay  So, that means we have to manipulate the  
just make sure that you just putted the frames  into the first few numbers of the timeline  So,  
just put the keys into the first few frames and  after that it will just have a cycle, cycle loop   
So, as you can see the red line  
inside the graph editor is showing that we  are currently in that particular frame   
So, you can just move it here  and change the particular point,  
like this way you can have a proper flow of  your animation  And also by simple tweaking  
of something you can have to achieve a  good result inside Maya software  So,  
make sure that whenever you are working, don’t  have to focus in one part, you just have to  
focus from head to toe to legs to feet  And each  and every part you have to manipulate it  okay  
So, that would be much more better and it will  also form some amount of realistic animation  
points through the tangent, or we have to add or  maybe we have to delete the point  If you just add  
as compared to the normal animation  So, having reference is also very important,  
you can shoot yourself inside a room or in  the garden with a camera, or with phone   
After that you can just import that video into  your computer and just look at each and every  
frame  And you can just work in Maya to copy your  animation, that would be much more realistic  Okay  
So, having reference is very important  especially especially in animation,  
you can also have reference in modeling   If you don’t have how can you make,  
but you can also sketch things in modeling  And after that you can use in Maya and just  
model the same thing, but you have to sketch   But, in animation you can’t use your imagination,  
because if you use your imagination, definitely  the animation will not be in superb as compared  
to the realistic one  So, if you are experienced  then it would be okay, but if you are a fresher or  
extra points definitely some amount of jerk will  came  So, whenever you are adding onto your model,  
newcomer definitely you need some reference  Okay  So, having reference you can easily easily  
manipulate your character or change your  character, okay so that is very important   
Like this way you can just work on the  timeline, move to the perspective to  
just have a particular look of your character,  that it is working quite well or not  okay,  
I think rest is fine, so just putted  some value into the channel box, so that  
you may have the idea how you can just  manipulate the things like here  And to lift  
little bit of liftment into the toe,  so we have just putted few numbers  
going to translate Z  And you  just move it like here okay and  
between these two points here also,  we just need to just lift the toe  
and also the heel region of the character  So, will just move it somehow here, and as you can  
the points into the timeline or the key, you have  to think about that  If you need maximum point,  
see the Z value which we have just move it, and  having the particular weight into the character   
okay So, like this way you can have weight with  the help of graph editor, and weight into the  
character is very important  If you put weight  definitely your animation will look some much  
of more realistic  So, in next session we  will have a detailed view of our animation  Okay 
you have to just undergo through a very  very amount of corrections also   
block process, and now in this session we  will do some amount of tweaking inside the  
Because if you need maximum points, definitely  jerk will came, so minimum points you can adjust  
through tangents, because all the tangents has  been given  So, as you can see we are in channel  
box and just delete it and the manipulated, the  translate Z value, which is minus ninety  And  
we moving frame by frame, so that you may have  the idea about how you can put it in each of the  
frame  So, in character or in any organic  especially we don’t require this scale in maximum  
cases  Yeah you can use this scale value, but  translate and rotation is quite fine for me   
And now I am using the translate and rotation,  because we don't require this scale here   
And again and again you have to  switch it to the graph editor,  
so that you may have a proper look of the point  flowing into your graph editor  So, as you can see  
we have all the values which is situated here  and also we have the translate Y value, which is  
Maya software  So, as you can see we have  the timeline and also we have the panel  
now I am manipulating into the graph editor   So, moving forward and selecting this one,  
moving upward just select the tangent and just  take the curve, and after that translate Z will  
be happen  And as you can see the graph  is going from downward to upward region  
is that, when you are just working in the tangent  X, translate X, the curve value will form  Okay  
So, like this way you can work quite well  and also you have this region, which is  
here, and also move forward and just  go to in between the key frames  And  
just select this part and go to rotate Z and just  have the manipulation, select this one, and just  
make a curve which is the slant curve  And also  this part need to be little bit of like this way,  
like ease out  So, here we have extra points  which we have just putted the key frame   
which is situated at the channel box  So, we just  select any of the file and just put it the value,  
So, right now I will just leave this  and will just go to translate X only   
Because if you just open all the values which  is X, Y, Z, rotation X, Y, Z you will get the  
confused  So, you will open one at a time that  would be much more you can say beneficial for you   
If you open all the things, you will get confused,  so rather than having all the things to be open,  
should go for having only one at a time  Okay  So, as you can see we are forming the curve  
which is generated inside the graph editor, and  also we will play around the timeline  Because,  
whenever you are working in animation,  you have to keep on playing your timeline,  
so that you may have the proper idea, how  your character animation is growing  Okay  
So, as you can see we just putted  the two point which is at the top and  
moving little bit of higher value  And I think we  should move this part at first, then I will just  
which is the right side corner of your screen   So, as you can see if you play frame by frame  
go to the zero part, which is the first frame and  move it  So, I just putted one value move upward,  
so that we have the proper flow of the particular  curvature, and also will just move now here   
So, reason behind moving to different because  at first we have to focus at the mid frame,  
then after that we have to focus on the first  one  So, like this way you can just move point  
one by one, or you can easily move points  You can have the group of points, select all  
the points in a single way, and just move it up   Because you have to just make sure that you to  
do the animation proper in the few frames  After  that you will do the cycling which is the looping  
inside Maya, and after that each and  every step, the animation will be  
duplicated  And again and again the character  will move or walk in the same way  Okay So,  
that would be much more better, so that you may  have the idea about how your animation is flowing  
which is the shoulder recheck and rotate  Y  And here we have the curvature,  
select this curvature, delete the  points, which we don’t required   
And also we just move it here and also just  select this and just move it down little bit,  
Select this one and just move it somehow here,  select all the points and now we have a slate  
which is this one, this too and this part  specially this one, which is the twelfth  
frame  As you can see on the graph editor  timeline and here we are in fifteenth frame so  
we have to just switch to the frame by frame  That means in twelfth frame we have this point,  
at your timeline that would be much more fine  And as you can see we have select this part and  
and in fifteenth frame we have the another one   So, I will put the curvature which is following  
the twelfth frame and just easing out into the  fifteenth frame  So, that’s matter easing in and  
easing out, if you know the process of ease  in and ease out will have a good animation,  
as you can see here we have the same process  From  zero frame the animation is going upward and from  
fifteen it’s going the downward  So, like this  way you can have a proper loop of your animation,  
so now I am focusing on the feet region  So,  as you can see we have this frame which is  
the sixth one, translate Z at the value   We will just move it little bit of forward and  
also we just move it little bit like this  And  also just select the tangent and just move it  
happens next  We just have the loop which is  following the character in a straight way,  
will just go to the graph editor, because  whatever we will do, we will just have to  
and after that will just select the hand region,  
and will just move it  So, as you can have  the idea that each and every controller has  
its own key feature, which we have added in the  previous session  So, if you need any correction,  
you just select that controller and put it into  the timeline, and just work for the same   
So, the animation which you are doing into the  character, you need to work on the controller  
well  So, like this way you can have the X, Y  and Z axis and just putting the slant curvature  
into your graph editor, and also this one  the shoulder part  So, as we have used the  
shoulder pattern also we have animated the full  character  So, one by one you have to just select  
the particular curve and do the animation, or you  can <?>define</?> the same  So, whenever you are  
working in any inorganic or organic especially  in organic, you can say living thing    
manipulate inside the graph editor  So, will  just put this point so much of little bit of  
So, you have to move each and every part from its  mean position, okay that means if you don’t move,  
then it will just form so much amount of robotic  animation  So, if you need natural animation,  
you have to just select any of the curve and  move accordingly, so, each and every part have  
to be moved  Okay If you go forward, then each  and every part have its own slant curvature   
As you can see this shoulder need to be  worked quite well, and also just select  
this and manually and just change the position   And the graph editor that point has gone upward,  
select this part, and also we have  to do the little bit of slant   
Select this hand region and after that  what happens next? Will go to rotate Z,  
lower, as we need some amount of curviness  into the animation  As whenever you are  
Hello everyone, so welcome to this course 
So, that motion of the hand and also we will rotate it and also<?>8:34</?> few of the points
so will decrease the crease value by moving it into the downward region 
And after that will select the hand, go to the rotate Y and just select this point 
And which is the forward point which will help you to start, okay, so, will down the point 
As you can see whatever, we are doing, it also updating in the side one, because we
have just increased the loop area 
You have to just make sure that you have to work hard at the first few frames, after that
you will have continuity 
The legs are moving quite well with the help of timeline, you can just drag down at the
Because whatever you will do in the first frame, it will generate the loop, so, make
sure that wherever you are working, we will work properly 
In the first few frames <?>9:40</?> use the loop, so that it will follow the loop and
the animation 
As moving along the timeline we are in front, also we have to just manipulate the hit region 
So, that the flowing of the character would be natural, some much more natural, so each
and every step we have to follow according to the difference 
And make sure that whenever you are working you put the S button on or the auto key on,
so that you will don’t have to put S button at the time of just putting the keyframes 
Just put the auto key on, so that whenever you are changing, it will automatic update
reasonable speed 
the key on your timeline 
So, the retardation of point here, as you can see in the graph editor, it is performing
<?>reveals long art</?> 
And also follow along the timeline up and down motion of the a particular section, and
will just off this 
And <?>11:59</?> that what we will do?
Select this part, forward and just go to bounding box 
We will have the <?>12:08</?> 
If you are working in the bounding box, definitely the scene will be so happy and you work quite well 
So, renaming is very important, if you are working in Maya, you have to make versions 
After that, when you are satisfied with your work, just make sure that you will work on
So, that whatever happened in the current version, you can go to the previous version,
so your file will never been corrupted 
So, as you can see, we are in bounding box, also we have using the character, which is
in the perspective <?>12:36</?> 
So, as you can see here, we have NURBS and Curves we will off for a while, <?>retest</?>
animation and after that will go to the few of the panels we have to manipulated 
At first what we will do?
Let’s have a look we are in perspective and all the view has been on 
So, let’s on this NURBS and Curves, so that we will have a proper view of all the curves,
the plain <?>grass</?> 
which <?>13:18</?> 
All the things has been getting into in and all, so that whenever you are working, you
will get all the things <?>13:26</?> 
If you can just select that part, you can easily manipulate the same process 
So, renaming is very important, you don’t have to find it along in your channel box, sorry 
<?>13:40</?> and use the property name, function inside the Maya application 
So, whenever you are saving any file or manipulating any of the file or forming any file inside
Maya, or any other 3D or 2D software 
You have to give proper rename, so that whenever you call the file, you just put that name,
and after that your file will came 
As we have focused on this part, the foot is moving quite well, we have the controller
So, renaming is very important as whenever you are working in your file 
So, this point will be manipulated at the top, as you can see, the proportion of the
character is getting changed, according to the shifting of the points 
Maximum time we are using the perspective because perspective, if you rotate the same,
all the views which is in the loop, in the perspective form 
So, maximum time we are using the perspective, and after that you can also go to any of the
view, to have a proper check up at the section 
be down little bit 
And we are moving at here, and this section would also been down 
which will attach at the feet region 
I think, this part would be fine, so proper shipment of the points is very important,
which is shifting the points in a very well order 
Like this you have to animate one one in each each every point, which is forming along the part 
So, this point would be in the down region and this point at this both of <?>been</?>
is slantly, so that the animation which is formed would be yeah, the fine and smooth 
the curves, which in the rigging section have been formed 
This part would be down little bit and this part will also be <?>16:56</?> here to have
So, we will have extra freedom, so that we can move our feet quite well in a single order
a curvature look at our animation 
And <?>17:02</?> that it will just, I think we have to manipulate this section also, because
if this would be slant little bit of curviness will form along the shoulders of the character 
<?>17:33</?> proportion and the shoulder 
As you can see here 
As after block you have just to put some amount of points in between them, because if blocking
have playblast, play speed which is in quick time 
Or you can also use the real time, so right now I am using time for a while 
as you can see, so, we will just manipulate this part only 
And after that I have changed the playback speed from the timeline, and after that I
am focusing on the toe region of the character 
And select X, I think we have to manipulate, as you can see it forming the cycle because
So, these are the leg region and we have to just follow, because as you can see the L
box each and every step has been in quite well 
And you can put the value, if you are clean you have the side, you have toe left and all 
So, whenever you are working in the action step, you have to follow the process, which
is very important 
Because, if you have the rename process well, you can animate your character quite well,
At the first we will rotate the same because we need some much more details into the feet
because you don’t have to confuse 
Because, all the thing has been renamed quite well, you just have to put the value of <?>lead</?>
in the channel box and attribute editor, which is very important 
So, renaming is very important, if you are working on the particular complicated character,
which has all the parts, which has different parts, and also you can just manipulate the
graph editor 
Whenever you are manipulating any point in the graph editor, it will <?>20:18</?> some
amount of curve, and also <?>rename</?> the graph editor 
It will show all the names of the parts 
So, you will not get any confused, whenever you are working in complicated character like this 
region 
So, in this course we will learn about refinement process of our <?>0:10</?> and the animation
As you can see, the animation process is leaning quite well, it has some amount of freeness 
And also it has some amount of weight on the ground, so you can add extra points like 
So, I am in playblast option and will close for a while, because <?>20:54</?> right now
and go to render settings 
And here we have <?>presets</?>, so right now I will use the low preset, which would
be HD ten eighty P  This would be full HD, you can also go for 4K and all 
So, right now I am just using this one, and at point<?>21:12</?> or you can use the photo
version, which is also jpeg <?>21:18</?> okay 
Setting, scale, frame padding would <?>21:23</?> and rename process is again very important,
where you are saving your file in directory 
So, that it will move quite well and after that when just move it in this controller 
Now, the render process will have happen, at first it will buffer the same, and after
that it will produce some amount of rendering step 
Whenever you are working, bone will connect to the controller, so that you will have a
extra freedom that means you can just work on controller and get all the things like
a natural animation, so, you need some references also 
If you watching the reference, you can just animate it quite well, it’s moving quite
well in the timeline 
And if you play forward and backward, we can see animation is working quite well, because
we have added extra key frames to refine the process 
At first you have just go to the blocking step and after that you will have to manipulately
put some amount of points into your reference, so I am manipulating the shape, and also we’ll
process of the upper body part 
just editing the particular parts 
we have done, the looping step in the graph editor and it following the same speed 
Because we have started the first frame and the first few frames inhibited the same in
all the axes like x, y and z, in all the translation like translate, rotate and scaling values 
So, after that when you are satisfied you can loop the same, which will just cycling
the process 
So, one more I have to say that we have used this translate and rotate, so scale is not
been possible for this 
If you need extra details you can just put this scale, but in inorganic like <?>bouncing</?>
So, with the help of this, you can have a look that we have just edited the model with
ball and all, you have to work with the scaling process also 
As you can see, we are deleting the junk keyframe, so that if you add very high amount of keyframes,
then it will produce some amount of jerkiness on your animation 
So, make sure that whenever you are working, you will just put as much as a keyframe as
per your need 
So, don’t go excessive or don’t put little bit of, because if you put little bit, it
will just produce some mechanical animation 
But if you produce or just <?>3:45</?> huge amount of keyframes, it will definitely create
some amount of jerk on your animation 
So, make sure that whenever you are working, you just put the keyframes according to your
a particular graph editor, and after that we have all the points, which is situated
need 
So, as you can see, we are moving along the timeline and also we are manipulating some
amount of points as per our need 
So, will select the top part and just move forward, we are looking at the particular section 
This one would be fine and if I go here or in between them, select this one and move
it downward 
So, that whenever you are working, you will have a proper look, that means open the graph
editor at the top screen 
And after that you just manipulate all the things one by one, and will just select this
part 
at the graph editor 
And I think we should move it over here and select this one, should move it over here
somehow here 
If you are working in perspective, then you have to go to the top or the front or the
left one 
So, that means you have all the view and after that you have a proper look 
That whatever you are forming, you will form in a correct way 
Whenever a character is move, all the body parts will move 
So, you have to play with the head, the shoulder, the legs, the hand and also with the fingers,
if you need a proper and a realistic animation 
So, with the help of a single you can say manipulation process, you can add extra things
That means with the help of a reference, you can have a clear look, that which part is
moving when a character is moving 
And always use this loop up and down, as you can see, this loop is up and down, that it
will form a curviness into animation, which look so much more realistic, as you can see 
Now, we will put some amount of <?>point</?> specific area, so that the animation will
look some much more realistic as compared to this one 
So, we are working in the playblast, at first the playblast will buffer, and after that
a small window will form 
You can enlarge it by dragging or use the maximize button, so you can see the playblast
is a dummy of your <?>6:25</?> all the frames at first for the same then it will produce
like if you go to each attribute editor, you have all the panels 
a frame you can say the video file, so, this is only for examine purpose 
If you are satisfied with a playblast, then you can have a render and all 
So, manipulation of points is very important, I am forming some amount of curve in <?>6:45</?>
section 
And also will just look at ground by moving forward into the timeline, that means you
have to do again and again to have a clear and better look for the animation 
so, the rotation y as you can see, all the values are changed, if you have three axis
which is x, y and z, obviously we are working in 3D 
So, the x would be red, y would be green and z would be, so that you will not get any confusion,
In channel box also which is the right side on your screen, you can just add all the points
when you are working on the graph editor 
So, this step will also followed in the <?>7:35</?>, if you have <?>dope sheet</?> which is opened 
And all the points will have different colours, so animation is very important we are just
working in the animation 
You know about the graph editor which is <?>7:50</?> point, because if you can work in graph editor
well, animation will be so much more smooth and realistic 
So, by working in the graph editor, you will have a proper idea and also you have to know
Moving along the timeline and <?>see</?> the hand region is it flowing quite well, because
we have to just go to the <?>8:23</?> and move it here some 
one by one at a particular section 
Hello everyone and welcome to this course of 3D animation 
And after that will open the NURBS and Curves also, and will off the grid 
Because we don't require grid anymore and we’ll go to 
So, that the character will move at the ground, and after that will just put it on here somehow
here, and will off the grid because without having grid we can’t apply the ground, because
grid is required for it 
And after that you will go to the first frame, so that will check the animation working quite well 
One more thing we have to define that whenever the character is walking, the foot region
will not go inside the ground 
So, you have to take care of it, you have to go playblast 
And after that run into the timeline one by one, so that it will form a good playblast 
And after that when it happened, you can check your animation on the playblast, that it is
working quite well or not 
So, playblast has been completed and a new window will pop-up which shows the animation 
And as you can see, the animation is working well because the foot region of the character
is not going inside the ground, which is not overlapping 
So, that would be fine because we have to take care that the foot region or any of the
character part will not overlap to its <?></?>  So, we have to fix all the things 
Like this way you have to define a particular frame that you have the idea, that how character
is move into the frame 
are working quite well 
And how it’s such generating some weight around its motion, which look so much of more natural 
So, when you are working in animation, you have unique some references, so that you will
look at the reference and just work on the same 
Which is very beneficial, you have the reference that would be okay 
I will just go to and we have the bookmark and we go to the edit bookmark, so that we
have defined camera 
That means if you have the defined camera, you can use the camera, otherwise if you don’t
want to use the camera, you can use bookmark 
So, that the scene particular section of your scene will just form, and then have the apply
and apply to shelf 
Also the body part which is also quite well, and after that will just place this and also
After that it will form on your shelf, so whenever you change your camera angle, you
can go to that edit bookmark 
This particular section, so as you can see, we are now goes again as to form all curves
we have into 
And after that select any of them, and go to the graph editor and change the character 
Animation and decrease the points and after that we’ll just edit the tangent one by
rotate this according to our need, quite well into the timeline which is very important 
And after that if the plane is being done we will generate the group and will just select
this part and will go to translate X 
will put at in this view, which is the left view and will go to main graph 
And we’ll just select this graph, we’ll just lower the value like this way 
One by one will just decrease the tangent and we have to generate the curve, tangent,
cover graph, graph sheet editor 
And will <?></?> timeline to have a look at the <?></?> it’s working quite well 
And after that go to the playblast to have a playblast, that means again and again you
have to just open the playblast 
And the buffer will form, so that you will have the idea about having playblast on the
on your screen 
And after that will just work for the same, because whatever you does it will all show
in the playblast 
That is a dummy animation viewport, so as you can see, this is working quite well, and
And after that just go to rotate Y and select all the points, will click the same generate
the curve 
And we’ll lower the curve value and will select this and will manipulate, and which
is this fine 
And also we’ll select all the points which is it, so will just increase this value one
by one and with this rotate Z 
and will go to this section of file, and will move in this view 
And as you can see we have all the points which is forming the same, delete the points 
Let’s say if you take any of the point the portion and the animation of the character
will change 
Now, you can see it is running quite well into the timeline, and also you can add extra points 
If you need to add some much more details on your character, that would be okay 
So, one by one you have to correct it and also you have to check it, is it working quite
well or not, okay 
So, this point you need to be shifted so much more at the top and if you go forward 
As you can see here, so here we have foot region of character which is working but cannot
check, but change it according to the unique animation 
And as you can see we are in left view and we just check the playblast and after that
Because if you have the reference, you can watch the reference quite well, and after
that you change it according to the reference 
So, as you can see, the foot region of character is working well and we’ll select any of
the other parts, which you can manipulate it easily 
You select any of the other parts, which you can manipulate easily 
Last playblast whatever you does, it will buffer the same 
And it will put a new playblast on your screen 
So that you may have the idea, how you have done the animation on your computer, now,
look at the playblast and just check the animation is working quite well or not 
it’s working quite well 
Yes, it is working quite well, all the body part is moving well in a proportion way 
And now you have idea how you can manipulate the animation of the character, and how you
can change 
So, as you have the idea, you can work the graph sheet and dope sheet editor and all 
At first save the file, hope you understand the same and let’s switch to the next session 
Because the character is moving quite well and just cut it and in this section which
is the perspective one 
So, in this session we will define, so we will use the graph editor in this session 
Where, all the controllers which is into the character and we have just played around the
<?></?>  And after that have the graph editor, which has some <?></?> and mesh, and will
animate all the translate 
So, at first will mute all, so that we will have a normal and proper animation, will just
take and manipulate it, which work quite well 
As we are running over the timeline and as you can see that select the character, and
just go to the graph editor 
This point which will have to be animated, it’s following the loop, so we have generated
the loops 
You have to manipulate the first section, after that you can manipulate it according
So, you can see I just drag over the timeline and also we will add some amount of points
to your need 
So, we have pre infinity and post infinity, so we’ll just put the post infinity and
bring it 
And as you can see the animation will generate its cycling and in manner if it does go forward,
it will just repeat the same 
So, you have to add it and after that it will do that particular frame, at your timeline 
So, the points which is generating in the graph editor, which is the animation key,
so you can change it through the dope, dope sheet editor also or the graph editor also 
Okay 
So, with the help of this you will have a simple animation and you can drag it around
into our scene 
the timeline 
But, just minimize for a while and will just off the NURBS, so that you can have a good idea 
How you can have the animation and go to the playblast, so that find your area, where you
want to move the file or where you want to generate the cache memory 
So, that you will animate and you will have the idea 
At first the playblast will buffer to a few frames and after that when it gets buffer,
the animation will run smoothly 
So, you will have a pop-up window, which will open on your screen 
As you can see, the animation has been completed and a new window is formed, which is just
open on your scene 
So, at first I will put the playblast and check if the playblast is working quite well or not 
And after that it’s just, with the help of this, you will have the idea that how much
animation have done on your scene 
So, we’ll just look quite well because walking is important, after that walking we will have
to generate the animation between the keyframe 
So, that your animation will look more refined and defined, and after that you will have
to add some more points on your animation 
So, that it will look more realistic, so as you can see, you have to play frame by frame,
so that you will have the good idea about having animation, which is just on your computer 
So, as you can see 
So, frame by frame you just have to add the playblast, and this window as you can see,
With the help of this NURBS, you can easily manipulate your character, which we have discussed earlier 
And we just selected only one point, that’s why the graph editor is showing that particular curve 
Which is in x axis, because x <?></?> one, so just select and just go to the right section
of your screen 
You will find that controller 
So, you can move it according to your need 
And in this name we need a little bit of correction and this frame also 
If these manipulate the curve, definitely the animation section will change and the
character section will also change 
After that select one by one point, you can have the easily manipulation and as you can
the window has been pop-up 
see the graph generating quite well 
will change the same 
Because, we don’t require this and we’ll put the value on that, if you add extra points,
definitely jerk will gain 
So, right now as you can see I have just recall this point and I need this, this two one point
to be deleted, and this lowering value 
So, that you have to check it one by one that they whatever you have done, it is right or not 
And after that I will just manipulate this point also, because we don’t require this
And also it has the playblast feature and the character is been quite well 
point and after that if you just run the timeline on your screen, definitely it will show some
changes on your viewport 
We are in x, y and after that we have the three axes x, y and z, so three are just forming
into different colour, here the axes 
And all the curves are slant because definitely we have done the axes like this, and you can
see value from upper panel section 
<?></?> and after that you can put value 
Okay, and after that select this point, so it will delete the same, because we don’t
require that amount of 
Like this way you can check the reference work, because taking this value and also to
So, with the help of the render tool, you have understanding of how you can change,
manipulate curves and all, which you have formed into the animation 
So, we have three at the timeline, in that it working quite well or not 
Okay 
One by one the plane into the timeline and also the curve just go to the all the curves
will change, because it is forming the cycle, loop on the screen 
And after that if you just say see the animation, it is working quite well, like this way you
can put some points and also you can change the curve on your   
And after that you just check on playblast just whatever you have done into the screen,
you just follow the right manner or not 
Is it working quite well?
or how the animation you have done in Maya software 
﻿Hello everyone  So welcome to this session of  Maya two thousand eighteen  So in this session  
this epi curve you could just select the hair  go to the channel box and make a new layer   
Right click and add selected objects,ok no problem  click over here so that it will not select your  
hairs it will just produce reference,  this is for reference, ok this is  
n hair and the bottom one is the, your lines which  you have formed  So I will just select this line,  
see a dramatic change will there we just select  this, if you move definitely your hair follicles  
will move as you can see whatever you will do   Your hair follicles will move so that’s a plus  
point for there, you can easily adjust this   That means you have to just keep on playing  
with all the things like settings and all, after  that you can do whatever you want to do whatever  
style you wanna achieve you can do for the same,  ok, that means you have to just keep on exploring,  
you can change the color, you can change the style  and all  ok, You can also work, at first you can  
work in fur after that you can implement the hair  so like this process you can work for the same   
Make sure that whenever you are working  we have discuss many time that you have to  
work on versions so it’s very important to  work on versions whatever you have done,  
if you something gets missed you can go to the  previous version for the correction and all ok,  
like this way you can work for the same  Whatever  style we want if you don’t want to this amount of  
you can say the curliness you can change it  from there and you can also have a render   
You just click over here make sure that you  render using will be Maya software because  
we are not using any of the Arnold, Arnold’s  you can say textures and all, shaders and all,  
Arnold light and all, so don’t require this,  only Maya software is fine just have a look  
as you can see the hair follicles are quite  large you can just decrease the value it’s not  
see we have to center pivot so because the pivot  is forming at the downward region  So I will go to  
selecting because we are in reference mode, just  click over here go to the attribute editor    
And now you have the n hair and all the things  which come across for the hair system  So you  
change the bend follicles and clump width like  this way you can just work for the same  There are  
many more things like you can increase the sub  segments height and all which is very important  
or also you can play with some of the as you can  see the segments are in low quality and that’s why  
hair per clumps if you need  to decrease you can decrease,  
if you need to increase definitely you can  If you don’t want to display so much of hair  
into your view port, you can just decrease the  value or so now here we have the clump width scale  
you can decrease the values or increase  according to your need  If you go down,  
you find all the things like collisions and all,  so as you can see we have the color and all  If  
modify and here we have the center pivot  So now  the pivot has been centered aligned and after that  
you go to dynamic property you will get all the  things like if you want to change some of the  
properties of the hair you can do it well  You can as I wanna show one more thing  
I just selecting this and going to the channel  box and I think we’ll just hide this for a while  
D you can change the pivot easily  Control D and just rotate the same  
shift D to have multiple copies select all  this and right click add selected you can also  
just work like this if you go to you can play with  different styles and all, definitely it will work   
we’ll go to the left view and else what happens we  will just select this pencil action tool and just  
As you can see if you select this and  just go to channel box, make a new layer  
right click add selected, reference this  so that it will not select by mistaken   
And select any of the spline or multiple  spline by holding shift and right click and go  
to control vertex you can control the vertex  definitely your hair will change as you can see   
So you can play with clump and you can  play with the style of the hair and all  
it depends on you, you can also change the  color,ok  So when you are working in hair,  
if you working in any animal  if you need to generate the fur  
that time whatever you are focusing just open  only in that particular part, don’t have to open  
the all the parts of the body  Because sometimes your PC may get  
hang up because each and every hair has its own  poly and it’s all been calculated inside your  
if you press B and drag your left mouse button  If you just press B and drag left mouse button,  
PC  So make sure that whenever you are working  you just focus on that particular part, ok   
So right now I am deleting this this hair  because we don’t require this right click  
so in hair, hair system shape you will get all  the details panel whatever you want to make,  
whatever you want to change  And you can also just  have different style it depends on you, if you  
use the epi curve tool in a very good order  definitely your hair will look like this,  
with the help of simplification of the  panels you can achieve a good result, ok   
So here we have the maximum self-alliteration and  all you can just decrease the value if you want  
to do some, some amount of changes definitely it  will work on the same ok  So like this way you can  
you can decrease or increase the brush  size, ok  So I will paint this like,  
play around your values to achieve a good result   If you want to just add some beard I am deleting  
this for a while because we don’t require and  also I think it will delete these hairs also,  
this one, ok  So, we don’t require then delete  from here, definitely the things will be deleted  
not this one and not this one, delete   
If you want to play with the beard definitely you  can, that means you have to give more time  If you  
can give more time definitely  it will have a good result, ok   
It’s not showing,  
here it is, no problem because character is  at the center so we have to shift this and  
G to repeat your command W G Again  
like this as you can see its painting  quite well  Just paint like this  
Center pivot  
time taking thing you have to  just keep on adjusting like this   
At some part we have to adjust this manually  because if you can manually adjust definitely  
things can work quite well   
So if you just put like this no that  doesn’t work you just select this  
and you just go to vertex sorry  
we’ll put this character in a  separate layer and reference this   
Now it will not select accidentally, so  you have to just wrap this like this   
Definitely it will take some time  but you will get a good result   
so I have just painted in a rough way you can  do it fair but I think we don’t require  ok, no  
So I am just skipping this part and just  showing that particular part and this one, so  
select all those right click  we have to make one more,  
This is the problem as its getting  random so to fix this you have to just do  
few things like just go over here right  click add selected reference the same   
And go to spline and just do some amount of  tweaking like, this will not been look like  
random because if you just adjust  this definitely it will not look  
Select all of them, control vertex, select this,  move it somehow here, select this, control vertex,  
problem So what else we have to do we have to just  extract that part ok  So right now I will just go  
You can rotate this or just put it  inside the, so you can rotate this,  
ok, so this is the main concept behind hair  and fur inside Maya application  That means  
if you have time you can just manipulate  this according to your need or you just  
put it like having a reference and just look at  the reference and just put accordingly  So one  
more thing, see rotation is very important as you  can see its just standing like this control vertex  
select all of them and rotate the same  One selected at a time  
and just rotate the same and just insert it  inside the polygon  So it will look more, more  
natural  So that means you have to just adjust  this, make here and just duplicate the same,  
you have duplicate copy, duplicate special and  duplicate the same, whatever you will do here  
to here and here we have the extract feature,  here you have the extract click over here   
we will learn about the CG grooming which  is also known as hair inside Maya software   
it will directly update here  So but sometimes  you have to do manual tweaking because  
hair and moustache and beard that’s are not  similar in both the side  To keep on just  
doing some random tweaking  So hope you understand  the same let’s switch to the next session 
Now that part both of them has been separate with  each other and go to object mode and just select  
this part or just delete this part now this part  is being extracted ok  So here we have the extract  
feature select this part no problem  We have  some polys because this very high poly model  
if I go to press one definitely it will show  the harden view but also you can see it is so  
high poly that it’s just smoothing the process  If you press three definitely no cancel operation,  
we don’t require to hang up my PC, so right now  I will just work like this so I will select this  
part press one and now again we have to just  center the pivot as the pivot is been centered,  
no problem  And else what happens now I will just  make some dummy here at the top base of the model  
ok  Just press F this would be the top base just  adjust like this you can just put some amount of  
texture so that some hair will look like hair  And also you can and also you can add some normal  
So let’s get started, as you can see we have  just imported this model and also this model  
bitmap so that if you have the hair image you can  just put it  Because right now I am using this,  
this tool which is the epi curve tool which  is inside curve surfaces and I will just drag  
random hair and after that we’ll  select all the hairs and just put  
extend which is inside Maya software  So we are  in modeling tab we have to switch to FX ok   
But later wards when we will switch to FX we have  n hair and now at that time we will use this make  
selection curve dynamics, ok, we’ll go to its  setting but at first we have to just make the  
curve so that we will just  put some amount of hair   
Ok, I am just making some amount of curves here,  
G your last command will repeat right now I  need to delete this as I will form again   
is a very high poly  So we will not put the  hair all over the model  What we will do  
Now as you can see the hairs has been formed and  now what I will do select this hair all of them   
And go to modify and here we have the centered  pivot, control D to duplicate the same  
and control D again to duplicate the same  as you can see we have to adjust the hair,  
align it properly as it is going out  So we have  to adjust like this, so this will take some time  
if you have patience definitely you will can  do a good result, you can achieve a good result  
definitely yes and this will  take some tim, No problem   
And just select this and  just move it somehow here   
So what else we have to do, the vertex in a very  good order like this  ok,So, each and every thing  
you have to look, right click control vertex and  just control Z sorry I will select this part and  
we will just duplicate this model control D to  duplicate it and just move it somehow here ok  
just move it somehow here, control vertex select  and move somehow here, make sure that each and  
every hair is connecting to your surface, ok   That means hair will not look floating into the  
air, so make sure that just select all of them  just move it somehow inside the head region  
D and move it somehow here  Right now I have to  just manual, manually do the correction process   
Whenever you are working make sure that you  will save your file  So I will save my file   
Now here underscore zero  zero one, saved my file    
You have to make the version so that if something  gonna happen you can just go to that particular  
version and just do whatever correction you want  so version making is very important if you are  
working in Maya you have to work in the version   So the version making is important inside Maya  
If I want to make the hair at the top, I will only  apply in this part  ok, So I will only apply in  
software and also just I am just doing one more  thing is that just duplicating all the thing   
After that I will manually do the correction  as you can see some of the hairs are floating,  
floating inside some are just into the  air, so we have to just manage it   
It will take some time otherwise it will not look  so good so that means you have to give some time   
like this I just putted some of the hairs  
and also here we need some amount of hair   Now what I will do I will select all the hairs  
control D and just move it little bit,  we’ll select all the hairs control D  
just move it little bit here control  D and move it little bit here   
So that would be fine you can  add more hairs if you need but  
this part and I will make some random hair  After  that you can have the idea how you can just make  
right now just for example I am showing you  some of the features of hair inside Maya   
Now what else we needed we’ll just go to  the channel box and here we have the hairs  
not select the model and the, this base model  we’ll just make a new layer and right click  
right click add selected   So rename this hair save   
Now save your file again make sure that you are  saving your file which is very important   
Now what else we needed we’ll just select all the  hairs not this mesh, we’ll just select all the  
mesh hairs sorry not the mesh one  So make sure  that only the hairs are been selected control Z   
Now save file again  We are in FX tab  So we have  in FX tab and here you have the n hair, n stands  
for nucleus as we have discussed many times  Here  we have the make select curve dynamics so I am not  
implementing this particular part  And just going to its settings here we  
the hairs  ok, So now let’s get started, as I am  going to the front view and I will turn off the  
have the settings, make sure that you will just  reset it and because all the values will change  
internally and now we don’t required the NURBS  and curves because this is hard to manage   
Yeah you can do it well but you don’t have so much  of properties as compare to the paint effects,  
with the help of paint effect you will get all  the panels which is present inside the n hair  
it will came to the attribute editor  Paint effects I will not using the  
make curve dynamic just putting apply ok  Now  as you see the hairs have been applied and  
we have the brownish part which is the hair,  we’ll go into the attribute editor and here you  
have all the things which coming across for the  hair  We have the hair system shape, pfx hair,  
hair system, nucleus and time because  this is n hair, n stands for nucleus all  
the things will generate from the nucleus  So we have the clump and hair shape you have  
grid from here for a while and what I will do I  will just right click hold your right click go to  
the hair per clump you just increase the value  definitely we’ll see some of the changes  Right  
now we don’t have some changes as you can see  your hair gets smooth  If I zoom as you can see  
Here is the clump width  So you can change  your hair from here and there are many more  
panels, we just change your hair  Ok, And here we have the  
clump width scale so as you can see  
whatever you want to do you can do it from  here  And here is the hair width scale,  
we have to just keep on exploring whatever you  want to do ok  You can just put some amount of  
fur over here the little bit hair, ok   If you want to change the vertex of your,  
face and just select the back region the downward  part and delete we don’t require this part   
﻿Hello everyone and welcome to this session  of module number forty  So, in this session  
from the interception help me immersively  towards this end  Finally, as you can see  
that we have just examined all the processes  of a particular 3D film  So, each and every  
created the alternate eye cameras with which they  shot the brief project, image data performing any  
required in painting to fill gaps in the image  data, that were exposed by the parallax   
Little attempt was made to make creative use  of stereoscopic depth  The primary goal of the  
process was to provide a comfortable viewing  experience for the audience and towards the  
end  The dynamic range of the parallax was  clamped at a very conservative time limits   
Disney’s next animated film Meet the Robinson  released in March two thousand seven, push the  
integration of stereoscopic 3D deeper into the  studio <?>1:54</?> process  All through Robinson  
also alternate as a 2D film and was converted  to a 3D by an outside vendor  The studio kept  
the creation of the alternate eyes, cameras,  stereoscopic layout process in-house, in order  
to maintain creative control of the 3D depth  This enabled the depth to be scripted  
we will take a 3D movie and do the case study  on it, so let’s get started  As I have taken  
in a manner that were supported and  enhanced the narrative of this film   
Later, the use of the internal in act station  settings or default parallax limits  The depth was  
very dynamically to mirror the emotions content of  the film for a short period of time  So, the step  
of the integration of the stereoscopic process at  the studio is represented by the animated film   
Bolt is the story of a Hollywood dog, unaware  that he is starring in the television series  
about the canine superhero  Having been led to  believe the adventure and the power are real    
When Bolt is accidently transported across the  country, he must tried to make his way home  
with the help of alley cat and hamster  While,  coming to grab in the fact that he is a real dog,  
Bolt released in November twelve two thousand  eight was the form  Its intercept produced  
for both 2D, 3D theatrically exhibition   Now, we will discuss about the project philosophy   
the movie called “Bolt” which has came in two  thousand five  And we will discuss the process,  
So, stated simply our philosophy on Bolt was to  optimize 3D experience, for both in its immersive  
effect and the comfort of the viewer  While, using  depth as a storytelling tool, it seems that cinema  
for the matter storytelling is generally has  had a history of innovations that tends towards  
higher and higher degrees of immersive   Storytelling has evolved from the spoken  
words of the recount hurdle around the fire to  the stage performance, to the cinema of today   
Cinema interns has evolved from the silence  black and white to talkies, color widescreen  
and surrounded sound, each advance attempt to  place the audience more sequentially with the  
trick of the story  Feel amused and now digital  display technology had advanced in resolution, and  
dynamic range to make the alternative  reality being present by the filmmaker   
A more compiled illusion even non displayed  related film innovation, such as the zoom lens,  
each and every step from pipeline to  project to execution and to achievement   
or the steady camera represent a technology aim  at pulling the viewer deeper into the experience   
Now, the second process is the managing depth  So,  in the stereoscopic layout process the task of the  
cinematographer can be distilled to manage  depth efficiently  For the management of depth  
to be effective, the process had  to be aligned with the twin prongs  
of our philosophy, for making a 3D film enhance,  storytelling and comfortably viewing    
Now, the third process is the depth score   The commitment to using stereoscopic depth  
as a storyteller tool decided, that there must  be a constant plan for the application of depth,  
that somehow would mirror the narrative content of  the film  A depth score analogs to a music store  
is however is very crucial, if it reflect  the emotion content over time    
In order to guide the application of depth  through the score is a constant fashion  So,  
So, Walt Disney animation studio lastly animated  film Bolt represent another milestone for the  
the use of two somehow little visual metaphors,  the first was the emotion impact of the film  
content, was proportionally to stereoscopic  depth  Being presented the second was the  
emotion distance we feel from that what  we see transferring on the screen   
It’s proportional to our separate from in  a 3D space, of particularly significance to  
the emotion distance is the relationship of the  subject of the point of zero parallax  The screen  
at the depth the frameless defines a window  into the scene, that can be linked to the  
process art of the theater   The prescribe proximation of the audience is much  
greater, when a character crosses the frame line,  and the risk of the carrying the analog too far  
is of the audience <?>sider</?>  Following these  two rules provide the framework for a constant  
3D style for the film  This rule may not be  have unavailability psychology validity   
studio in the integration of stereoscopic 3D into  the creative process and production pipeline   
But, it is my belief that the audience  will unconsciously learn to ascribe,  
associate meaning of the particular <?>7:02</?>  choices made through the courses of a film,  
provided that they are present in constant  fashion  Display space stereo parameters  
is the fourth step, one of the techniques  that were invaluable in order to achieve this  
stereoscopic depth to follow our depth score was  the adoption of our 3D need to work within display  
space parameters  The actual <?>dis parts</?>  that were ultimised to present to the viewer,  
rather than concerned them themselve with the  conversional stereographic parameters, such as  
inter lacks distance or converging angles   The camera operator could be in the same language  
being employed by the depth screen  Only the  display space parameter of near parallax for  
parallax and screen position were  needed to configure this stereo  
Disney lead to the charge into digital exhibition  in two thousand five with the release of Chicken  
rig  Software would automatically mapped  the parameter to camera space, distance  
and then configure the inter lacks distance and  conversion angle to confirm to this mapping    
So, the fifth process is the composition  shifting, the first technique of the  
fact that the <?>insta</?> of the  <?>8:22</?> pipeline was the multi  
layer rendering  This approach has been adopted  to the studio, because of the flexibility  
afforded in controlling the look  of the final composite image   
What is the mean of 3D was the <?>8:40</?> to  just the placement of the depth of individual  
render layer through a horizontal offset of the  final composite  This allow us to take a shot that  
has been composed with the telephoto lens, and  set the parallax well beyond our comfort limits   
So, the fact that a degree of blur or deep  focusing is related to depth has been used,  
Little in the Disney digital  Chicken Little was  turned as a post conversion of the monoscopic  
as a means of adding back the third dimension  to monoscopic photography, essentially making  
depth of field a type of synthetic depth queue   By controlling the effect within a short track  
focus was created <?>9:20</?> with the  sharp focus that a depth plan where the  
viewer’s eyes would be covered  The use of depth of field has become  
such a standard part of the grammar of the film  that even in computer graphics and the animated  
where we are free from the physical  constraint of real lenses  Depth of  
field is often simulated in order to provide  this photographic depth used to the viewer    
So, the pipeline overview is one of the most  primary in design criteria for the Bolt pipeline   
Was that we would to be delivered two version of  the film, one for monoscopic exhibition and one  
for the stereoscopic exhibition  To optimize  for store and rendering requirements, a goal  
film from an outside vendor  Disney supplied the  CG scene geometric and monoscopic camera as well  
was established to use the main or monoscopic  camera, as the left eye of the stereo camera  
led to the majority of shots  For shots where the needs of 2D  
and 3D could not been recount a unit left  eye would be build for the stereo pair   
Such process between the two version of the film  was occasionally by depth of field adjustment,  
which required the generation of a new left eye  imagine with matching focus or when to reduce  
probability  We were focused to paint out a  feature appearing in only the left eye    
So, finally what we have concluded through  the use of the techniques that I have  
outlined  I believe that we succeeded in  creating Bolt into a stereoscopic film,  
that delivered a satisfying immersive 3D  experience, yet, avoided the eye strain that  
is too often associated with the medium   The fact that every <?>store</?> was 3D form,  
as the rendering image level, that were used to  create the final composite image  The vendor then  
Hi everyone 
up my model 
what I will do, I will start posing it according to the reference and so as all the things
are there if you just look at it 
so let’s start 
Now, what I will do I will just off the grid and we’ll select this part and will press
So, in this session we will do the posing, so it is part two and as you can see I have
new material and Lambert 
Now, our problem has been short outed, so what I will do, I will just go to file and
make a copy save scene as, just select I think this one is fine, especially this one 
So, if you select this controller at first what I will do, I will just select the body
and we’ll go to channel box and we’ll reference it so that I will not select the
body in accidentally so select the controller and just move 
taken this reference and also we’ll choose any of the action pose and we’ll do the
So, here you have the controllers which has been formed 
button and move here 
As you can see it’s moving quite well 
And we’ll select this part and rotate this 
the feet 
posing, so let’s continue 
like if I select this firstly this part I will rotate 
I will select this and we’ll go up to here, I think this would be fine 
same select this, move by dragging middle mouse button 
So, as you can see we have just make the pose and I will just do another posing so we’ll
select any of the files 
So, we’ll not select from here, we’ll have another reference so I will save a reference 
What I will do, I will just make a new plane and after that we’ll select the plane, press
So, in next session we will discuss another difficult posing inside Maya application 
So, let’s switch to the next session 
W and after what I will do I just don’t need the segments so I will go to <?>0:40</?>
and here you have the ten which is one and minus five 
So, I will select this and we’ll go to front and we’ll just rotate the same so I will
rotate it by ninety degree and okay fine 
So, we’ll decrease the size and we will put it over here 
﻿Hello everyone, so in this session  we will learn about the bouncing ball,  
will break it tangent and will move further   So, what we will do will break the tangent again  
and will move like, so it’s not possible to tell  each and everything, each and every panel    
So, you have to keep on experimenting things, if  this would be possible, you can do it    
But, these are very simple as you know that each and  everything will be applied on your particular  
vertex  And to break your or to attach your or  to change your tangent point into the keyframe,  
which is also called vertex and graph editor   So, you have to just experiment the same   
Now, as you can see your ball is behaving  better as compared to the early, so  
here we have high velocity  So, I select this  point and you can decrease this a little bit,  
as you can move from holding your middle mouse  button  I will do control Z control Z  If you want  
to move any of the tangent points, or any of the  vertex, or any of the keyframe, you have to select  
and press F for focusing your object and you  will keep over here  Make sure that you will not  
it  And by holding your middle mouse button, which  is also known as scroll button, you can click and  
you can move easily  So, that’s a main thing and  selects this tangent, will move like here   
So, as you can see I just press the  spacebar, it’s forming irregular shape,  
so what we will do just click on the move  middle mouse button and move little bit   
your view is being highlighted  As there is a  light grayish colour line, and if you select this,  
your view will be highlighted  So, if you select  your ball and just press in this view, you can  
update and you can see the updates also   But, if you press here and just click it over here,  
you can see the updates, and also you  will find some much more difficulty   
collapse, if I press four you can see, now it’s  getting collapse from here  And it is not good,  
So, that’s the main thing you have to just keep  the selective ball, and after that go to here  
and just play forward or play backward  So, now one  more thing is that I will just call all my views  
here and will update this laterward  So, I will  just press spacebar, right click, hold your right  
click, go to perspective  So, here you have the  bouncing ball and now you can have a look at  
how a concrete ball bounced  How a rubber ball  bounce, how a plastic ball bounce and or how a  
if the ball is iron, how it get bounced   So, you have to see the videos and work for  
the same, so reference is very important  If  you have reference, you can work quite well,  
because life example is very important in the  field of animation, in every field  Especially in  
modeling texturing, lighting, rigging, animation  and dynamics, so, if you have the reference that  
would be better  And one more thing if you go  to your timeline, here you have he timeline and  
so you should just put it over here somehow over  here, will press five and here is your ball   
right click  By right click, you have one  thing is that playblast  So, rather than  
clicking over here, you can go to here, which  is the setting and what playblast does?  
Playblast will generate a video clip and will show  you, that means if your file get buffered  Then it  
will produce a small video clip and will show to  you  So, make sure that your encoding will be in  
eight point two six eight four, which is a video  version, so we don’t require JPEG image sequence   
So, h one two sixty four as you can required,  you can use it, but for now I am using  
h one two sixty four  And also the size of  the video, so we don't require it right now,  
you can scale it or even you can have  frame padding  What is frame padding?  
That means it is of around four, so it will just  generate and also have a auto backup after every  
four frames  So, frame padding is there, if you  want to decrease, you can decrease  So, I will  
So, if you are dragging something on your  viewport, you find that all the things, all  
put around two, so click on the playblast, and now  you have the particular view  All the view has apt  
As it’s acting quite weird at the  last, so I have to sort out it and  
so I will off this  And will just go here and  
what I will do just select this part again, and  will go to the graph editor, and will change   
So, select this part and you should go to graph  editor to change, and to have a good result   
So, let’s switch to the next session 
the parameters will change  That means you have  to just freeze all the parameters which you have  
worked  So what i will do I we’ll  just select this ball and will go to  
modify, and here you have the freeze transform   So, what it does? It will just put all the value  
zero and only scale value would be one  So,  freeze transforms now all the value is zero,  
I will select both of them, modify, freeze  transform  Now, one more thing is that  
and also we will learn few of the things, which  we have discussed earlier about timeline   
So, we have made the ground, okay  so if I press four, as you can see  
it’s lying on the grid and we’ll modify a freeze  transform  We will not animate this part will  
animate only the ball, so what I will do? I  will go to five and will select the ball    
And I will save my file at first, we have to save the  file, so, bouncing bouncing ball underscore zero  
zero one  Always make version that would be fine   If something happened you can directly go to your  
previous version, and just correct the same  So, now we have the scene all the transformation  
is zero  Now, what you have to do? just Select and  if you want to just give translation value only,  
you can do it well  But, I will just  on all the things because I have to  
work with scale or rotation, if I need it  further  So, what I will do just press S button,  
So, we will discuss in details about the timeline and  also about the bouncing balls, so let’s continue   
make sure that you are in one frame and how you  can increase the timeline  So, here by default  
which is one one twenty as you can see if you  drag this particular section, you can have  
the timeline, which is around two hundred  So, you can zoom this like so it will zoom, so  
after one frame two frame will came, three frame  will came like this way, so you can just drag   
If you want to increase the timeline number, that  maybe the duration of time, and click over here   
If you need five hundred, just press five hundred,  Enter, so it will convert into five hundred 
So, like this way if you are in a one eighty six  frame, click over here, you can go to that  
particular frame  So, I am in two nineteen  frame, so I will zoom this like this way   
You can zoom and focus inside  the frame, it will just  
zoom it, so, by default which is two hundred, so  I will make two hundred, so will enter it    
Now, what will do I will just go to polygon and  here you have the ball, so if you click the ball  
So, one more thing one more thing is that here you  have the auto key  So, will on the auto key,  
because if you are not using the auto key  Each  and every frame you have to go, and just press  
this S button on your keyboard  So, that it will  update or just put the animation key on that  
particular frame  So, we will not use it, we will  only use the auto key  At first, I will press S  
as button on your keyboard, as you can see  the thing has been animated in first frame   
And all the translation, rotation and scale value  is been animated  Now, what I will do I will on  
the auto key and now I don’t have to press S all  the time  So, what I will do it’s start from this and will take  
three, four, two, three, four, so we’ll take three  block as you can see these are the blocks  So,  
we’ll take three the blocks of times and will  just jump like here, and will move further   
And make sure that don’t put like here,  
always just put it over here  So, one, two, three  and will have four, so I have two two blocks  
of the ball gets down  As it move forward  and after that sometime it will just stop,  
so we’ll go here and we’ll go here  and will go further  And we’ll go here  
will one, two, three, we’ll go here, go,  
we’ll go here and we’ll keep  the ball and then go further   
I will go further, so I will increase the  size, I think you have to shift this forward   
side view, this would be fine and will move,  we’ll go to front, I think front is fine  Okay    
but it’s not looking natural   So, what we have to do?  
Select this and will go to  one sixty frame, and will put one sixty,  
so after that it will follow the loop   So, it’s not looking natural, as you can see  
it’s not acting natural, it’s not looking natural   So, what we will do as we will perspective and for a time I will  
turn off the grid  So, what I will do? I will  select my ball and will go to any of the view   
I think perspective, press spacebar and right  mouse button, hold your right mouse button    
So, as you can see you can change your view, so I will  go to front view, so here is the front view  
So, I need some more space, so I will just off this  view by dragging it, and will off this view  
also by dragging it  And after that we don’t  require this side view here, what we will do will go to panel  
We are in front view and what we will  do? So we’ll move little bit like here  
and in panel you have the panel  And in panel you  have the graph editor  You can also open through  
window animation editor and here you have the  graph editor, but, it will float like this     
So, we don’t require to float because we need to  fix its position, either you can just drag like here   
But, that would not work properly because all  the section will be smaller, and you will find  
difficulty to manage  So, I will just close from  here, or also you can go to window and just  
work here, because if we are comfortable,  then you can work from here  So, now I will  
go to panel and I will go to the panel and  here you have the graph editor, where is it?  
Here you can find  So, now it’s change and  if you want to go to your previous panel,  
how you can just right spacebar, right mouse  button and you can go to any of your view   
So, that’s very easy if you want to drag your  view, you can drag  Now, I will not require my  
and we’ll make a new box, and just click this box  and move it somehow here  We’ll increase its size  
another view, so I will just put like here and  
will change the panel  And will go to the  graph editor and now if you select your ball,  
what you are getting? You are getting  two translations  As you can see  
the ball starts from its initial position,  which is one, and if its goes as you found  
that in fifteen frame, we have the key  So, we  have to manage this key particularly this one   
One more thing is that, if you press shift and  
and holding your alt and right mouse button  You can just zoom it according to your needs, so  
if you want to zoom, you can also zoom by scroll,  so like this way  So, I will, if you select the  
key, if you move forward, as you can see it’s  going up  If you select this key which is here  
and go downward, see ball will follow it  So,  we’ll select that particular section, and here you  
and we’ll increase its size like  this and we’ll keep it like here   
can see it’s showing the white part between the  two vertex, or you can say the two keyframes    
So, here you have a break tangent click over  here, now you can easily break, so what  
happen see  If I just make the curve like this  as you can say this is an inorganic thing    
So, you have to make like hard hard  structure or hard shape inside your  
tangent, and inside your graph editor   So, I break the tangent over here also,  
as you can see what happens next? Here we  haven’t updated the same  So, will update,  
but at first let’s check is it working  or not  It’s now getting tipped  
here you can found its getting tipped,  but after that it’s getting behaving like  
weird  It’s quite behaving weird here,  because we haven’t changed this  So,  
we will pause this for a time, and I will go  up to here will change this particular section,  
So, now as you can see our box and ball both  are formed and I will just keep this ball,  
﻿Hello everyone, so welcome in this session   So, what I will do I will go to the great angle  
You can press Alt and middle mouse button to  have a panning, and will select this part,  
let’s have a look   
It’s not touching,  
will zoom this, I think its fine   So, now the problem has sort outed, as  
you can also just click this part and just move  little bit forward, and just go up to here   
here  So, now you have the problem  which is sort outed as you can see,  
of and will go to the graph editor  So, go to  panel and here you have the panel feature and  
So, now you have the idea, how you can animate  simple objects and how you can change the  
tangent into graph editor, and how you can just  work in the graph editor for handling the tangent  
and all  So, in next session, we will discuss  about you can say the poses and also we will  
just follow some references for that particular  pose  So, let’s meet to the next session 
graph editor, and after that we have to adjust  the last section  So, press spacebar, right click  
and front view and will select this part, and  after that you get all the features here    
And so now what I will do I will say go  here and just play forward, let’s see   
So, it is too far, so press your middle mouse  button, you bring it little bit of near   
And also you can just add extra extra key  points here, so but we don’t require as we  
only have this amount of frame  If you want to  work quite well, because the auto key is on,  
on you just you can animate further  So,  like this way you can work and, now see   
What I have to do? You decrease  the size little bit, and  
Hello everyone 
If you are working in light you have to check through the render tab, but if you are currently
moving around your viewport or if you are examine anything particular section, you can
press four because, see, the scene is getting lighter 
But if I press seven, what happens, the scene will be heavier 
So, by pressing four, you can go at that particular place 
Now, one more thing is that, if you select any of the particular object and if you go
to Arnold and in lights, here you have the mesh light 
So, what mesh light does, if you click here and I have press the seven, now you see, it’s
converted into a light 
Now, as with the help of this, you can also go to your additional parameters 
So, in previous tutorial we have learned about the Arnold physical sky, but in this tutorial
Now, you have all the things which suits and which you can change according to your needs 
So, now, it’s converted into mesh light and you can also change from here the light
visibility 
For a test, I will just render a particular image 
So, at first, I will just check all the things are in low quality, ok fine 
Now, I will just make a test render and what we will get, will get nothing because that
light has, you can say, vanished 
So, what we will do, here you have light visibility 
Maya, this is transform attributes 
we will learn more about its and we will add some more lights from Arnold render engine
So, we don’t require this 
So, here, you have the show original mesh, no, we don’t required mesh 
Colour is fine 
So, you can go over your intensity, just play around your intensity 
I will just on the <?>2:56 </?>  If you want to change the colour of your light, yeah,
definitely you can do it well 
If you see the leaves, the lower part is getting shadow as compared to the upper part 
So, you have the idea about how you can change the light and all 
So, here we have another most important thing which is IES lights 
and also we will look at some of the additional parameters inside attribute editor 
So, here have a couples of different presets of IES lights, which is available in Google by free 
So, you can go to any of the website which provides IES light and you can download for
max, Maya or any other three D software 
So, you have the IES lights, as I just open any of them, okay now you have the both IES light 
Its file extension is IES file and it’s very small in size 
So, now, what I will do, for IES lights, you have this photometric light 
So, this will allow you to create some IES lights 
If you click over here, now your photometric light has form, where it is, here 
I will press four for a time, go to here, press F, you focus this particular section 
Now, just put it over here 
So, let’s continue 
You can work in perspective if you are forming the light 
But make sure that whatever you work in perspective, you just have to just rotate around your axis
to see the correct position 
If it is going in the correct direction then it is okay otherwise you have to maintain it 
Or even if you are not comfortable in perspective, you can go to any other section, that is front,
side and top 
Or even, if you press shift button and right click button, by holding shift and right click,
you can change any of the view in your Maya 
So, that’s a very much freedom as you are not comfortable in perspective 
So, to have a look at each and every lines 
So, what we have?
So, if you select, we don’t required white colour because already we have so much of
white colour lights 
Now, I will change it to any other colour 
So, I will just put some amount of lighter green <?>5:10</?> lighter blue and all 
That’s good 
White, back of it is white, no problem 
Just focus in this <?>sactioust</?>
Change it through attribute editor and there is a problem in selecting, you can go to outliner
and here you have all the features 
If you want to select this point and you can’t select it because there is a mesh also 
We have this scene 
Make sure that you have to rename each and everything properly otherwise you will be
in problem laterwards if you have very much thing inside your scene 
So, you can also change your letter from here 
And one more thing is that, there are much more options, if you select this light, specially
this one and go to attribute editor and here inside this panel, we have so much more panels
like sub surface scattering, diffuse, specular, indirect or volume which is by default present
in your render settings also 
But these are different and these are different 
This is basically inside the light and this is basically when your scene will be rendered,
after that it will apply the same 
So, for a purpose I will just press four 
So, if you can keep increasing its value then also it takes some render time 
So, now what we will do, will just use some of the normal lights here and we will start
render with it 
Four is basically for wireframe 
So, it’s very easy to handle the wireframe 
Hello, welcome to this module thirty six ‘Science of Color’ 
I hope you will enjoy the session and will be benefitted 
So, let’s start this module thirty six that is ‘Science of Color’ 
Hope you must have enjoyed the earlier classes discussing the various aspects of ‘Science
of Animation’ like 3D modeling, texturing, shader, lighting, etcetera 
Myself Doctor Arjun Singhal, Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science, Banaras Hindu
University is going to discuss the Science of Color, which is essential for developing
a high end aesthetic sense in animation design 
Color plays a vital role in computer graphics and with the recent technological advancements
it has become an essential part of the science 
In this class we will be discussing the elements of design, color theory, primary colors, secondary
﻿I will delete all the lights one by  one and I just have only one light  
we need so little bit of bounceness over here and  will put some lights like this and after that,  
what we have, we have the back part  So, will select this light only  
and control D, will move here and  just move here  And what I will do,  
just simply grab this, press R for scale and will  scale this  And will tilt it, so that its position  
is just straight of it  So, just press seven and  have a look that if this is quite well or not   
I think it’s quite fine and okay we have to work  in the omni because you can select from here   
You can work in the omni because  it’s bouncing so much, we need  
a little bit of bounceness, not this amount  of  So, will just decrease the intensity by  
little bit of lower and what happens  if you have negative value in light?  
If you have negative value, it will just  absorb the nearby light's intensity  So,  
in this particular section of light  So,  let’s quickly set up a particular scene  
will not put any negative value  If you can, you  can have inside a particular big large screen   
In studio, the artist use the negative  intensity to absorb nearby light intensity    
Also you can put some of the small lights  here or you can use the spotlight or even  
the directional but directional will  change your whole scene so will not use   
You have the area light which is same as this  one  So, like this way also, you can have  
more lights  We have proper lighting  I  think this one is fine  This we have to work   
We will use some amount of omni here also   And we will also shift this omni downward  If  
the omni will shift downward, then it will  fall the whole surface here  So, we don’t  
require any light here because it’s already fine  and what we will do, will just select the omni,  
move little bit of down and what we will  do, will increase the intensity little bit   
for our lighting  So, I have just erased  all the lights and we have only one light  
Now, what else we have, select this, will  go downward and all the things is fine   
So, will go to render settings and will increase  the camera AA by eight, diffuse by, I think six,  
specular, exactly we need specularity, so I think  six  Transmission level, will not just increase  
it very much because it needs RAM power and sub  surface scattering instead of using transmission   
So, it will produce some amount of glow   
In organic character modeling, especially in human  modeling, we use sub surface scattering in skin   
But we have mushroom in this section, so we  will use this sub surface scattering little bit  
so that it will just illuminate the  light in its corner and in the top   
So, volume indirect, volume  indirect will increase by two   
Ray depth, we don’t require ray depth  And here  also we have specular, but we don’t require ray  
here and one more thing is that, if you want to  erase this light you just do one more thing, then  
depth because we have just work in the sampling   Now, what we will do, will go to view and go to  
bookmark, camera view  So, I will just pause  this video and will show you the render image  
and you may have the better idea that how we  can adjust by few tweaking the light and its  
you just select that particular section, press  delete  Now, your mesh light will be deleted   
And now let’s quickly set up a scene for our  lighting  And what I will do, I will just go to  
the seven view and just put some of the lighting   At first will go to six, control D and will put  
some lighting over here and have a look and what  we will get after that, let’s have a look    
Will set the colour and the intensity laterwards,  but will adjust the light  At first, will go to  
render tab and here we have the point light which  is omni  Will put some of the point light because  
﻿Hello everyone  So, as you  can see, we have rendered this  
you can say the gamma value  which is zero point ninety  So,  
we have this scene which we have rendered already  setup in Arnold  We have used the lights and  
so the textures are simple which is  basically mental ray textures   
And so, as you can see, all the things are in  soft, producing very soft and I am going to  
the render settings as we have discussed also  the camera AA value is eight, diffuse is six,  
specular is six, transmision four, sub surface  scattering three and volume indirect will be  
two  If you increase this, ten, it will produce  more smooth result  So, the points points like  
structure which is cranes will not even  happen here  So, that’s the main reason   
That’s why I just put it eight and yeah it  will take some time to render the same   
And this is the quality which is HD seven twenty  P  So, if you are working in ten eighty P, it will  
particular model and after that as you can  see, we have some soft bounceness over here  
take maximum time and if you are working in four  k, so it will take huge amount of time  That’s the  
main reason  So, I have rendered this in half HD   And okay so, you can change each and everything   
So, right now we are in Arnold, so better to have  Arnold render because you know the parameters  
of lighting of the Arnold  We have the skylight,  half of the thing will be done in skylight because  
it’s a global light and it will produce  some sort of bounceness and after that  
to fix the particular part, you have to use the  area light or even the omni or even the you can  
say IES lights which is photometric light  So, with the help of the Arnold you can also go to  
normal rendering tab, here you have and you  can use all the Maya software lights like  
directional light, spotlight, area light or  even point lights  So, like this way, you can  
work quite well and also, you can work with the  Arnold light  That means you can work in both   
and also from here  So, we have some lightness  and the sun shadow which is producing here and  
If you are in Arnold parameter, you can work in  normal rendering lights and also Arnold light   
So, you can combine both of them  But if you are  in this particular thing, that means if you change  
your render settings to Maya software, you can’t  work in Arnold because all the parameters will  
set to the Maya software  So, that means you have  to go to the Arnold, so that you can use both of  
them, this rendering tab and also the Arnold  feature  So, that’s the main reason behind it   
So, now you have the idea how you can  produce some sort of smooth light with  
the help of Arnold and also we will combine  that thing with the Maya software lights    
So, that’s the morning light, you can say, and  I think you understand quite well  So, these  
things you can adjust by yourself, it depends  on you, how much value you want to take   
So, I think, we should switch to the next session 
this area is contrasting well  So, we  have used the physical sun and sky   
And all the things is bouncing here  So, as you  can see, we have more features like this one,  
which is the exposure and the <?>gamma</?>  So,  you can just grab this to have a clear look   
As you can see, so like this way you can work  quite well  If you are satisfied with this result,  
you can do it or you can also go it  here and just change the values if you  
need some much of lighter as you can go here   And also you can just put it like this   
So, that’s totally depend on you  I just put it the  exposure value which is one point sixty three and  
﻿Hi everyone  So, welcome in this course of baking  texture and light in Maya  So, baking is very  
texture into medium or low quality, according  to the need of the director in the game   
So, we have this convert to file texture and UV  range is by default and one more thing is that,  
as we have discussed about the shadow of the  light, if you increase the shadow, definitely the  
shadow would be smooth, soft  If you decrease  the level, it would produce raster and it  
will form some blocks and same in this also   If you need your texture to be very much detailed  
in high quality, then you have to just increase  the resolution  So, I will increase by one zero  
two four, you can increase more than that   But I am using zero two four  So, I will just  
enter it  If you want to increase three thousand,  you can increase that would be the texture would  
look very much detailed and all  So, JPG file  format, we have chosen the JPG file format  
and will go to convert and close   So, if you converted, it will automatically  
but at first, I will do one more  thing, will just select this part and  
close this panel, this particular one  So,  let’s check each and everything is fine or not   
Transparency, we does not have  any transparency object here,  
so will not choose that one  So, right now,  I will just go to convert and close  Now,  
it’s converted and as you can see,  new textures has formed here  Okay   
So, now, what I will do, as you can  see, it has lowered the quantity,  
quality of the texture and if I increase by  two thousand more than that, it will definitely  
work quite well  So, as you have know  that we have <?>13:43*</?> opened the UV,  
you can open the UV and just put the texture, so  the texture will not stretch like this okay     
So, no problem, we have to focus in the baking  of texture, as you know how to open the UV,  
how to implement the texture in the model  You  have to select each and every part at first   
object mode, control g to group it and will  go to window and here we have the outliner,  
So, at this time, we have just closed this  one and will select this part  This is the  
top and bottom  Select by holding shift,  
edit and same  Convert to file texture  Maya software  Convert and close   
Now, new texture has formed  Will select  this part  So, this is the Lambert six and  
will go to edit and here we have the convert  to file texture Maya software, click here  
just select this part, go to ground because we  need the light, we need the shadow to be bounce  
into here because we have a ground  So,  will go to edit, convert to file texture  
Maya software, click here, convert and close  So, right now, we have converted, as you can see,  
the shadow has formed here  So, the shadow has  formed and right now what else we have to do, just  
rename this  After that, will select  
close this part and now we will go to the  render settings and in render settings, we have  
this features all render using   Now, I will change to mental ray   
As we have changed to mental ray, I will go to  features and just see that global illumination  
caustics is off because we are baking the  texture  And if we increase this or check this,  
definitely the time will increase  Render  features and all, so I will just check each  
and everything is fine  Here, we have to just  open this one, including the shadow and contours,  
we will go down, let’s see  Rest is fine  Now, I will just go to indirect lighting,  
make sure that I will just off this  global illumination and final gather  
as it will take maximum time  So, I will just  off this and now, what I will do, I will go to  
this panel and will change to rendering  So,  after getting to rendering we have a particular  
this group and will scale it down, okay scale it  down and will just put it over here  So, press f,  
section called light and shading  So, will go this  panel and if you are not selecting anything in the  
model, no problem, we go to light and shading  and in light and shading, here you have the  
particular section of batch bake mental ray  So,  will not click here, will go to its settings   
So, when you click the settings, here is  the setting and we have object to bake all   
If you have selected something, you can go to  selection, but we will bake all the objects and  
one more thing, bake optimization, multiple  objects, okay fine  We need to bake the shadow  
because we needed the shadow because we  have used the light  Rest are fine    
Now, it will take some time, as, if you click  on convert and close  It will take some time  
and after that, it will, right now it is  calculating and it’s done  Now, you can  
delete the light  If you delete the light,  it will not affect your scene because  
so we don’t have to collapse it  We will just  put somehow like this  So, now, what we will do,  
your scene is now become the proxy and will  render the same data  Let’s have a look  
So, as you can see, it is baked and  now, if you increase the size of the  
shadow, definitely it will produce some more good  result  So, right now, as we can see the shadow  
quantity is not fine here, but in rendering, it  is not like that  As you can see, if you delete  
the light, then also your shadow, your texture  will be there  So, like this way you have to just  
work and make sure that whenever you are working,  if you select any model, open it UV at first  
and then apply the textures  If you have some inorganic thing,  
like particularly the bike and all, you can  use shaders as well and if you are using any  
character and all, you have to open the UV, then  you will just put the texture and do your baking  
of texture and lighting in it  So, we will discuss this more,  
will just select the plane and also will go to  the polygon tab and will add some random edges  
but in next tutorial I will take a high poly  car and will lower it’s all the settings like  
the shadow settings and the texture settings   So, we will form a proxy model of that car  
with the help of baking of texture and light  in Maya  So, let’s switch to the next session 
like this  So, as you can see, we have just added  some random edges and will move here, right click,  
object mode, select the plane and will go to the  mesh and here you have the smooth  So, now, your  
plane is been smooth and also, what else we have  to do? I will just select each and every part and  
put some textures  So, this would be the sword  At first, there is the history  As you can see,  
important, if you are working for a game project  or if you are making some game models and all,  
there is a lot of history  So, I will select  the model and will go to edit, delete by type  
history  As you can see, all the history has gone,  only three things are there  So, I will select  
this part and right click, assign new material   So, before assigning, I will go to the render  
settings and make sure that it’s in Maya software   We will not use mental ray right now, we will  
switch it to mental ray laterwards  Why this going  to happen, we will discuss it in the session   
So, will select this part, right click, hold  your right mouse button, assign new material  
and here would be the Blinn and we have some  textures also  So, I will go to colour and will  
just put some texture from here  Will have the  file and will click over here and sword texture,  
have the steel texture as, if I press six  button, you can see the steel texture   
So, now I will select this part  and will rename this, blade region   
you have to bake  What is baking? That means the  lights you use in the Maya and the texture you use  
Will select this both, right click, assign new  material and will use the Lambert because this  
would be dull and will use the colour, go  to file, click here and the elastic part,  
so, we will not open the UV because we have  to just discuss about the fundamentals,  
so we will not focus on the UV  You can do it, well, if you press one, you can  
just open the UV, but we will not use UV in  this because we have to just focus on the  
fundamentals of baking of textures and lighting  because UV we have already discussed about the UV  
in a previous class  And also we have  make some separate tutorial for UV   
So, will select both of them and will rename this,  
top and bottom  So, rename is very important   If you go to window and here you have the  
rendering editors and in rendering  editors, you have the hypershade  So,  
in the Maya  So, after baking the light and the  texture all combine in that model and the light  
if you don’t rename your model, you will be get  confused  So, we will use the hypershade  So, if  
you renamed it that would be fine  So, select this  part and will assign new material and will use the  
Lambert itself and will create the colour   So, I will put some jute texture here  So,  
you can put it as per your need  So, I will put  some jute texture and will rename this handle    
So, now, we have this sword and after that will  select this, will go to assign new material,  
will just select the Blinn and I will put  some normal texture so I will go to colour   
tiles or any other checkered type of texture  So,  now it has been applied, as you can see, so it has  
been applied, so here it is the default container  has come, so, no problem, now we have these,  
and it’s shadow, it’s intensity and all  the parameters of the light will behave  
Now, it does not casting any shadow and  all so, what we will do, will just select  
any of the lights from the rendering tab,  here we have the lights  So, will just use  
a directional light  You can use point light  or even spotlight, area light and the ambient  
and all  So, I am using the directional light  and if I just increase the size of the light,  
if I go up to here, will move here, will move  somehow here, and will press seven button   
You can see this  The model is getting  light, the light is casting into the model,  
if you rotate the light, definitely your  model will just have the light and all  So,  
I just put it over here  If I look at the  model, what we are getting? Let’s have a look   
Okay fine   So, now, what we will do,  
at first I will just decrease the render size  because right now we are in testing mode  So,  
as a texture in that model  So, let’s have a look  about the baking of texture and light in Maya   
what we will do, will select this light and  in light, you have directional light shape   
And in light, you have shadows  So, we have a  very simple model and the model is also very  
low poly and we don’t have any other model in  this scene  So, our scene is quite lighter  So,  
you can increase this shadow by use depth map  shadow and can increase the resolution   
Now, if you look at your shadow, you will find  that there would be some noises, as you can see   
This is because to the resolution is five twelve   If we increase this by two thousand, what happens?  
Your shadow would be not so pixelate  So, if  you increase this, if you have a heavy model,  
definitely the render time will take much  more as compared to the lighter model    
So, make sure that you will have a good PC, you  can increase this resolution and also if you have  
the good PC, you can work in this particular,  which is filter size, bias and all,  
So, for that, what I will do, I have some  models  At first, I will select this part,  
shadow intensity  So, these  are the features of shadow   
You can increase the filter size  That will  take some time to render, obviously yes   
So, now, as you can see, it’s getting little  bit of faded at the corners  If you increase  
the filter size, definitely it will effect  So,  right now, we have the sword and the directional  
light  Only one light I am using, you can use  two or three lights according to your need   
So, what I will do now, as I will go  to the window and here we have the  
rendering editors  So, in rendering editors, we  have the hypershade  Hypershade is just like that  
of, if you select any object and just press right  mouse button and just go to its property just like  
assign new material  Whatever you get in  here, you will all get in the hypershade    
So, if I click and just drag, you can see, these  things are same in your assign new material  So,  
which is the sword model  And I will just go to  Maya files and have this model to be imported  
that means hypershade has more freedom to  manually select all the things one by one   
So, if you want to select, you just have to  click and just go to its attribute and select  
the same  But hypershade has these features  also which is the sub features of hypershade  
as you can have different things here  So, that means if you want to work more  
detail in texture, you can have to understand the  concept of hypershade  So, now, will just select  
the model at first one by one  Will select  the model and as you know that we have just  
renamed this blade region which is <?>fong</?> I  think  So, here you have that particular one    
So, I will select this one, shift select  this texture which is been implemented to  
it and what else we have to do? Will go to  edit and in edit you have very much panels   
But we will focus only in one panel right now   So, here you have the convert to file texture   
So, convert to file texture, Maya software  So, am not using this one  I am using its  
settings  So, I will go to its settings   Now, a dialogue box has opened  So,  
make sure that your anti-alias will be  off  We are not using anti-alias  So,  
it would be off  That means it will take maximum  times  Now, background mode is a shader default  
and fill texture seams, okay this would be check,  bake, we have to bake the shading group lighting  
and we need shadow to bake  So, after that, when  it gets over we will delete this light and your  
model will be lighted as compared to this one  That means if you have extra lights, if you have  
many more features like IES and all in the  light, you can just bake the light and the  
texture so that your scene would be lighter   That means, in gaming in gaming industry,  
the artist uses this baking system to have  high poly games into low and high quality  
what else we have to do? We  just have to make a plane and  
As previous we have discussed about it 
So, the texture would be in low quality, after when we just hit on convert and close 
The texture would change from this to have a low quality as compared to this one, because
we're using six hundred, you can use two thousand, three thousand 
So, to avoid the render time, I will just go to convert and close 
Now, we will focus on next part and as you can see a texture has been converted 
And now getting rusted, as you know about if you increase the value definitely, your
texture look quite well 
But now, it's getting rusted because we are in low quality and, we'll select this part,
but at first we'll move, we'll select this part, all of them, one by one, control Z 
One more thing we have to do, we'll select this part, control h, control h, control h,
So, we have selected all the body parts 
control h, control h 
We'll just select the seat, which is here, shift select, edit, convert to file texture
"Maya software" 
So we don't require transparency and convert, so now it takes some time to do the conversion 
And after, that this panel window will close, then you can revoke this, yeah it's done 
Select the ground, because we also have to do it, as the shadow will cast here only 
view and in rendering view we have this panels 
So, we'll just have to shut it 
And now what we will do, right click 
And one more thing, if I go to the direction light, we have decrease the value of shadow 
So, as you can see, if you increase the resolution size, definitely your time will take 
So, we have just using five-twelve 
So the shadow would be of low quality and the textures 
Okay 
You can just have one thousand or two thousand, if you are working in simple model 
If you have a good PC configuration, you can just increase the resolution 
As the shadow will provide smoother 
Okay so we'll not focusing in the resolution, because you have to just take the idea, how
you can bake the texture and light 
Assign new material, or we have the material which is "Phong" 
But you know about the depth map shadow, and also the Raytrace shadow 
So we have just of the Raytrace shadow, as it will provide some amount of transparency
and glossiness, because if this provides then definitely a scene will be heavy 
So, just click the depth map shadow and the resolution is five-twelve which is low 
You can increase it if you have a good PC configuration, and if you're working in a
heavy model 
You can go to one thousand or two thousand in between them 
So, now we'll not use this part as the shadow will provide, which would be rough and all 
So, no problem 
Let's select this ground, and what we will do, we'll just have a look at the ground,
Okay, no problem 
which is the Lambert 
As you can see, here it would be updated, as we have selected it and you can have a
better texture of concrete and all, but just for your knowledge, I just sharing all the
things 
You can just change according to your needs 
Now once again we have to click because, there is the big transparency, convert and close 
Now, it's just converted and what we would do next, so we'll just close this 
We don't require now, as if I just see the shadow because we are in low quality shadow
which is five-twelve, I think 
So as you can see, the shadow quality is not good, but you can change it as you have the
We can use, and in blinn we have "Car body" 
idea, how you can change it 
So, see this shadow quality is not good and you can change it quite well, you have the
idea 
You just have to just work and just select this part 
Inside attribute editor, in direction light shape, you have the shadow parameters 
So, just open the depth map shadow, increase the resolution 
By one thousand to two thousand 
Then it will produce a smooth and soft resolution 
Now, the next thing is that very important, which has go to render settings 
In render settings, we doesn't have any features here, because there are only two tabs 
So, I will rename so that, when we do the touching thing, we will never forget the same 
So what we will do, now we will just go to "mental ray" 
As by switching to mental ray, you have the feature parameter, feature tab 
So we'll select the feature tab and we'll uncheck all them, because we don't require
"global illumination" and "caustics", because baking is only for games 
Nowadays it's also applying in movie, but maximum cases it's done only for gaming purposes 
Few movies like animated movies, they use baking purposes for their shots and all 
But maximum times it uses in games, so shadow is checked on, fine 
And everything is fine I think 
Contours, let's see the contours 
In feature 
So as you can see, few parts has been left 
here, click here, in light and shading 
So in light shading, you have one more feature which is "Batch bake mental ray" 
As we are in mental ray, and we'll go to indirect lighting, at first just check global illumination
and final gathering is off 
If this will be on then, your render time will take two times more, as compared to the
without having this opened 
Okay that means if you open this, it will take two times more 
If you have a good PC configuration then 
So we'll just off this, Now, we'll just cut this thing, because we don't require 
So I will select one by one and do all the corrections and all 
And we have to go to the lighting and shading parameter, which is at the top 
And in that particular one, we have batch bake which is mental ray 
So we'll not click here, just go to settings 
Here we have the settings and in settings we have, object to be "bake all" 
If you select any object you want to make that particular, you can just go to select 
But we need to bake all the things here, now all the things is been bake 
And baked to texture 
That means your shadow, your light, your reflection will all form into texture, that means you
can delete your light, but your scene 
And also if you have multiple lights in your scene, your scene will be heavy 
Okay, so as we have selected this and we'll go to the colour, click over here 
So, if you're working for game modelling and all, you have to just co-relate the light
with the model, for baking and all 
And after that you can delete the light, your scene will be lighter 
Okay because in gaming mostly the model is low Poly and the complete model is very lighter
as compared to the movie 
So, now what we will do, we just go to bake to "texture", fine 
Bake optimisation, which is multiple objects 
Bake shadow, yes definitely we require shadow 
And bake to camera perspective, okay so, now we don't require this "keep original shading
network" and "use bake set override" 
Here is the file, so I have the texture of this Ferrari, so I will select the texture 
So, in this we will take another model 
Because this will take huge amount of time, and also it will not proper, because we have
already decreased the size of the shadow from the direction light 
And also, we have decreased the size of the texture, so we don't require this 
Rest are fine I think 
Now what we will do, convert and close 
So as you can see here, it's processing 
Hope you understand the same, let's meet to the next session 
We'll open it, so as you can see, if you press six, your texture has been wrap 
But, there is a problem 
So what we have to do, we have to flip the texture 
So I will select one by one, make sure that you're in Polygon and we'll go to edit your
<?><?/> and here you have the "Flip" 
Click over here, as we will open this option and will just check 
Nice!
So as you can see it's applied quite well 
And fine, now we'll select this part, fine 
Select this part, fine 
So, what I will do, I will take the another model 
Select this part, fine 
So, if I select all of them 
So, I have the same textures like here we have the same textures 
And we'll just right click, assign existing material and here we have the glasses 
Okay, so we'll just put it over there, and as you can see these are the "Shaders", so
I think we don't require it 
But yes, we have to just focus in the inside part 
So, we'll just select all them 
Control "h" to hide the same 
If I go up here go up here and drag it 
We'll select, right click, assign existing material 
We'll select the interior, so here we have 
I think it's fine, we can just have put it some textures, as you can see 
it somehow over here 
And in mesh tool we have "insert edges", so we'll put two edges 
Now we'll select this part, we'll move forward 
And let's see, if I go to mesh and here we have the "smooth" 
So, once again we'll smooth the same 
So as you can see, the part is been smooth quite well and we have this 
As you can see, our car has been imported in our Maya 
Now, I will select this assign new material, and we need the "Lambert", and we'll go to
the colour 
And I will just put file for just reference purpose, so only for reference purpose, Okay?
So now as you can see it has been applied 
Make sure that whenever you're working you should be in Maya software, after that we
will just switch to "Mental Ray" 
So, we'll just off this and we have this setup 
So now, I will use this direction light, and we'll focus it 
So, as you know that if you're comfortable, you can use three or four light and it would
be better to use three or four light, okay?
So at first, we have to do couples of adjustment 
So that would be fine, and if I press seven, what we will see, we'll see this part and
we'll just rotate this, like this 
And also, just rotate this like this 
Okay?
So make sure that we will make a new version 
So we'll go to the first, and we'll just make new version 
And after that, well shadow is not generated over here, so what we will do we will generate
the shadow 
And now what happens see, if I look at the render, I think shadow will not be visible,
see shadow is not visible 
So, I will select each and every part and we'll rename the same 
So we have to work on the shadow 
At first, I will just decrease the size of the image, and six forty four eighty because
we have to examine at first 
So, my direction lights been selected and we'll go to attribute editor, here we have
the shadow parameter 
So I will use "depth map shadow" 
We will not use Raytrace, because we have to bake the shadows also 
So I will use the depth map shadow 
We'll go to the window, and in window here you have the rendering editors 
And in rendering editors you have hyper shade, so this is the hyper shade 
So this would be class one, ok fine 
If you drag this you will found this thing, which if you right click, the thing which
came from here, assigning material or any of them it will always show up here 
So in Maya, one thing has to feature that means you can open like this way also, and
by this way also 
So, what I will do, we have selected this shape, and we have the car body 
So I will shift select this part and we'll go to "edit", and in edit here you have the
convert to file texture via software 
We will use this part, click, and you will get box "dialogue box" 
We'll select all the body parts, by holding shift you can select all the body parts one
So Anti alias is off, and background mode is shader default 
That would be fine, so right now as we have seen the resolution will very much effective 
If you increase the resolution size, the texture would be look quite well 
If you decrease the size, the texture will be rusted or it will be in low quality 
So, as we have many parts, to avoid it I will just use little bit of it 
We'll not use two thousand, one thousand or any other value 
We'll just put it, I think six hundred by six hundred 
So, I know that it will just ruster because we're using this value, but you know that
if you increase two thousand or three thousand, definitely your texture would be more smooth 
And also it looks like your JPG, which you have just inserted on your model 
by one 
In session number twenty or the module number twenty, we will learn about the Blend shape
that you just have to click all the particular one, and just of this the angry and the objects 
Like this way you have to just can use very expressions according to your need  That means
you can make more expressions, so then play with the settings, so in the channel box 
Like this way you can add different things 
So, as you have understand the concept of blending shapes inside Maya application, with
the help of animation and creative deforms, blend shape and in the setting panel  So,
now you can animate easily and you can also use expressions like this, can also use all
the expressions  So, with the help of this you can have a good result, and also you can
work quite well  And with the help of blend shapes, so you can have animation into the
facial morphing and all  So, I think we should meet to the next session 
will select the model and what I will do I will make this at first will rename this main 
So, I will just control D duplicate it will move it here 
Morphing means that if I do some modification here in the duplicate, it will directly automatic
update into your main model  So, I have to make as much as model as I need for reference
and for expression  So, if you are doing if you imply painting three or four expression,
you need to your four models  If you are implementing more than hundred expressions, you need hundred
around one, two, three, four four models 
You can do it five twenty, thirty, forty it depends on you  In studios in high rise movies
they use around one thousand, two thousand morphing in particular, so, will just focus
or you can say the facial rigging pipeline  So, in this session we will learn, we will generate the
on four, four types of expression  So, if you know the fundamentals, you can work with
many expressions  So, you should have a reference, or you can also watch videos or also can examine
yourself  That if you are wording something or talking about which muscle are moving on
your face, so that’s very important 
I will select this model and what I will do I will just at first you can rename this,
press B, because right now I don’t need a soft brush  If I go here, now I can need
soft brush, so you can press B, and you can increase the fall-off like this  So, this
to do  As you can see our soft selection has updated, if you press B, it will automatically
several kind of stylizations of face, and how you can morph that all Blend shape in
off  So, press B it will update, if you hold a B, and right mouse button and drag it will
just decrease the size of your brush and also the fall-off area 
So, that means if you select one one segments, it will automatically update all the segments 
If you of the B what happens? If you just drag like this, it will just create the point
of that particular vertex, so press B  Now, you can move it will move that whole area
by affecting all of them  So, now I will go to the brush will select this part, will select
this part, so as you can see
if we will not put any symmetry 
Because when we do some expression,
Maya application, we will learn in this session  So, let’s switch to the Maya software and
move it upward, move it here 
have look how you can work with the Blend shape in Maya software 
I shift selecting and will go to this tool, and select this part and also select this part 
just select this only area 
Now, we’ll go to this area and we select shock and
Hi everyone and welcome to this course of morphing inside Autodesk Maya  So, in this
And just forming its shape, so will select this part, and it’s have just look this
part  Move it so cannot <?></?> and
use the symmetry 
Because we are definitely our skin when just doing some expression and we are just talking 
session we will do morphing inside Autodesk Maya  So, morphing I I have model and I will
And now this would be I silent, so will change the name silent 
So, what I will do? I will select all the parts or you can also select by shift, so
I will select all the parts  And after that the last part which is the main part, I will
select shift, by pressing shift and click over here  So, as you can see this part is
the last part, I will go to the animation tab, in animation tab you have create deformers 
So after that you have the blend shape, so you don’t have to go over there, you have
to open its settings  So, in blend shape go to edit and reset, origin is local that means
it will access from local, local will and also envelope is one 
So, no problem, so you can increase this angle of blend by putting it one, so can you create
it, and after that it will just create the same  So, as you can see you have created
these shapes and if you click here and just go to the channel box, and you found input tab 
Here in input tab you have blend shape one, so you have all the parts now  A silent,
shock, angry, smile, so if I zoom this, as you can see I will just click in the silent
or I click here, it’s highlighting in blue  So, in the viewport if you press your scroll
button, and just move it like here or like here, now it’s changing 
Same with the shock select this by pressing your middle mouse button, move it here or
up here  Now, what I will do? I will just select this face and will go to modify and
which is also known a morphing  So, you have all the expressions like this  So, if you
want to animate, definitely you can just select all of them, or just select only one model,
press S  As you can see It’s been updated so I am in auto key mode, if you click this,
you don’t have to just put S every time  So, I mean auto mode so as you can see we
are in going to blend shape and I have just animated all of them  And if you go up here, you can
find that it’s affecting quite well 
So, over the help of this all, you can just have a good result by having animated all
of them one by one  You can have to find a new expression with the help of them, as you
can see so like this way you can work  You have to go to the input blend shape, and after
freeze transformation  So, as you can see all the values has turned into zero, so now
﻿Hello everyone, so welcome to this  topic of animation and timeline  So,  
points and all the coordinate system of our box  is turned into zero, now you can animate    
So, there are two ways to animate, one at first  you just have to set few of the keyframes for  
a particular animation  And after that you will go  to graph editor or dope shape for good animation  
view, or even good animation refine a purpose  So, that means at first you have to animate by  
simply going to the keyframe and put some  keyframes, and after that you will go to  
dope sheet or graph editor  For more you can say  for more refinement  So, there are very different  
terms in organic as well as inorganic animation,  but, the concept is same  So, if you have this  
box, if you want to animate, there are two ways   At first if you want to move in only one one axis,  
which is this one, just go over there, and  right click and key select like this  Or even  
if you use the shortcut key like S, it will key  all the things which is present over here   
in this session we will learn about the  basic concept of animation and timeline,  
Suppose, I am in first frame, I just select this  and put S  Now, all the things has been animated  
and now we are in animation mode  I will go to  twenty frames and will put here and press S,  
ok as you can see it will travel from here  to here, so as you go here and I will put E  
which is for rotation, and will rotate the same  like this, and will put like S  And after that  
it’s getting animated and just circulating   And if you want to only focus in only one part,  
you have to select this key select  But, now you have animated so that  
will not happen now, because all  the coordinate system has animated   
As if you just deselect it or just deselect the  animation, all the key frame will be gone    
So, if you want to select the keyframe here which is  select by shift clicking, if you just select the  
so let’s continue  So, here in modeling  tab you should go to animation at first,  
model, and after that the keyframe will be shown  over here  Right now we don’t have any keyframe,  
because we haven’t selected the model  If you  select the model, now the red lines which is  
the keyframe will be shown over here  By pressing shift and just drag all  
to the red and after that you may have the  yellow handles  So, you can just select the  
yellow handles, and you can move your keyframe  like here, if you want to display your keyframe  
here and there like this way  Control Z for back  and just select shift and just select all there,  
and if you want to add the distance between  the keyframe  Just click like this and you can  
move quite well, so, that’s the main thing  of moving your keyframe  If you want to move  
this keyframe from here, so you can have  this handle and you can move from here   
So, all the things will be done in shift,  by pressing shift you can do it well  Select  
after that all the panels at the top of your  list will change  Now, we have the animation  
this model, press shift, select any of the key  and you have the yellow handles, you can move  
your keyframe like this  So, you have all the  freedoms that how you can move your keyframes,  
and if you want to adjust, you can adjust it well  by this  If you select this part and press S,  
there is no any you can say there is no any  problem to animate all the things, because  
if you are working in detail animation of  obviously you will not work like this, because  
this is a concept and be very important  So, that you have to just select each and  
every key and do the animation, sorry, each and  every translation and just do the animation   
So, one more thing is that in window here you  have the animation editor, and here you have the  
graph editor, and dope sheet which is different  as compared to both of them  So, you can click  
the graph editor, if you click, there would  be a graph editor which is showing over here   
tab over here also and we will discuss this one  by one  So, for animation what we have to do?  
Now, it’s showing the curves, what is  this? We will discuss in next lesson   
And now what more thing is that if you animating  something like a particular object or particular  
thing  If you are moving like this, it’s  moving here and here  If you are not pressing  
S button, if you move forward, it will not animate  the same, see it doesn’t happen  If you press S  
and just move forward, then it will happen  So,  to avoid it what you have to do? Here you found  
one one of the most important thing, which is auto  auto key  Here you have the auto key  If you click  
okay here and you can animate your box,  as you will go, you don’t have to put  
pressing S  You will just click, as you can see  it is generating the keyframe automatically   
So, like this way if I go to just position and  like this it’s moving here, and in between them,  
it just gone the top  That means it will just  you have to slow, and autokey is basically on, so  
I will go to have a new box and make  sure that whatever you are animating,  
it will create a slow and after that it will go  to the ground  So, after that it will just go  
here and there and after that it will move at its  certain position  And if you want to scale this,  
well you can scale, scale this up and scale this   It will automatically scale this down, because we  
have the animation key which is set earlier  So, this is very important that means rather  
than I am going to anyone, and just click key  select, and you can do by pressing S  And after  
that all the things will be updated, and you just  click here for your animation view  So, as you can  
say it’s moving here and right click if you go  to by pressing your right mouse button, which is  
right click  And here you have the playback speed,  so, play every frame free  If you go to real time,  
then what happens? See, it will go to the real  time  It will just go to the real time and here  
you have the all the playback features  So, I will go to the playback speed and play  
the coordinate system should be zero  So, if you click over here and drag it,  
every in frame free  So, there is one more option  for real time, not exactly play every frame,  
maximum to the real time  So, this is the every  frame which is playing in to the real time   
So, by default you have played every frame, so  this would be fine  So, here is the playback,  
so it will go playing forward and as  you can see this speed has increased   
And it will go backward and after that it  will go frame by frame, one by one clicking,  
and after that it will go frame by frame  by backward, one by one clicking   
And this will allow you to move forward and  this will allow you to move backward, so,  
it will update slowly and as compared to  this one  So, now because its running into  
free if we and it’s running into real time, and  you have jumped to the last and jumped to the  
first  So, these are the basic basic parameters  of your playing button into your timeline   
now you can see its position changes, then  what you have to do  You just select this  
And now what we will do we will go in detail  into the next session about your timeline and the  
some amount of controllers  Because, here  also we have some amount of controllers,  
and especially we have one more thing which is  called display key ticks and all  So, we will just  
file and go to modify and here you have freeze  transform  If you click the freeze transform, all  
the coordinate system of our box will change to  zero  As you can see here if I click now all the  
﻿Hello everyone  So, welcome to  this course so I have modeled this  
should have one more contrasting part that means  that would be much more focused and like this   
So, as you can see here also so this would be  the contrasting part as it is falling down here  
and after that here  So, that’s the contrasting  part, so you have to examine your contrasting  
part so that’s the contrasting part that means  if you are working in contrasting part it would  
be in this center that means each and every  body have of a character or even everything   
If you are working in animal also, the front  facing part which is this side and this side so  
this would have the first look and after that  the whole body you can look at  That means your  
eye will go in this part so you have to define  that part  So, I have couples of more references  
as you can see that would be a good example  this leg, especially this leg is the main  
source after that we’ll see the hand part   So, each and every figure has its own you can say  
and after that I have just do the rigging  So,  in this session we will do the posing inside  
the main contrasting feature or the main  contrasting part that means your eye will  
go directly over here  So, in this you have see  this would be the part and here this is the,  
here this one, here this one, so your eye  will first go and one more thing if this part  
only one part there could be <?>two or</?> more  contrasting part as we can see over here    
So, we have taken couples of  references and what we will do,  
will go to Maya and select the references and  we will pose at least three type of postures   
So, as you can see this is the fight scene,  so will take the fight scene from here   
As you can see most of the figure,  your first view will go to its leg  
especially the legs  So, like this way you  can work and this is also a fight scene    
Maya application, so let’s start  Before  going to posing you should have reference,  
So, will take some amount of fight scene, it  doesn’t matter if the anatomy is not matching  
to your model, it doesn’t matter what you have  to see the joint, especially the joints  If you  
know how to just manage the joints  and all you can easily work   
As you can see this is the joint this would be the  bone and it’s slightly go over there, this would  
be the pelvis and there would be the leg  There  would be the joint like this you can follow    
So, it doesn’t matter that your anatomy  is not matching to your model, so  
we shall start the work  Now, what I will  do, I will take the reference of any of them  
and we’ll start working on the same  So,  at first I will take the simple reference  
as you can see most of the references are simple  here  So, we will start from simple and we’ll go  
so I have taken some references as you can  see here  So, I will pose like this and  
to the most complicated one like this  So, let’s continue, what I will do I will  
minimize the Photoshop and we’ll go to the pose  reference and what I will do, I will just select  
this and we’ll go to Maya and what I will do  one more thing is that I have to go to the  
front  And we’ll go to polygon and just create  the plane so just for reference I am taking it   
So, plane has been created because the interactive  selection is off, I will rotate it by ninety,  
we’ll put ninety and after that we don’t  required these amount of segments   
So, will go to inputs and here you have the  segments like ten, ten so I will just have only  
one because we only have to just set this for  reference purpose and we’ll decrease the size  
so I will just not follow the exact dimensions of  it because I just need the image to be over here  
and just do by looking at the reference  So, what  we will do right click go to assign new material  
if you see the anatomy, if I go to brush and  if you see the anatomy here you have the body  
and here you have the Lambert and in Lambert if  you go to attribute you have the Lambert here   
Here you have the color so as we have  discussed earlier in texturing classes,  
if you click over here  Now, you have the another  node which is called create rendered node,  
so now you have the file feature, click  over here now it change to file attributes,  
file one and inside it you have the image name and  here you have the folder, click over here and what  
you will get, we will get the dialogue box which  will just direct you to go to your reference and  
just select that particular reference one  So, I think we have just set it in,  
we have saved it  If you select you can see the  reference over here, just open  Now, it’s not  
showing  So, to see the reference, to see the  texture which is basically a texture press six,  
now it’s showing here and that’s good, it’s not  showing in the perspective so what we will do,  
which is you can say it is quit slider   And also you have to define the most as you  
will press six and now it’s showing  So, this  would be the reference so what I will do,  
I will just rename this ‘r e f’ ref and all the  things are there in my particular group    
As you can see here we have the model as  well as the connectors which is this part,  
you can say the curve parts which is over here  you can made it from here  As we have discussed  
in rigging sections  So, now I will turn this  off, we don’t require the outliner because  
we will work in the poses  And  we’ll select any of the poses so  
let’s start this is one of the most simple  So, as you have to look at your pose at first and  
what you will have to do, just go to the  perspective and just select the file like if you  
can say the most contrasting part of the  body as you can see this hand is one of  
So, at first I will select the simple or you can  say the <?>rick</?> the simple cut so at first I  
will select the simple reference, so this would be  the simple reference and you can work in the same   
So, what we will do or you also work in that  particular so I will just select the section  
of the controllers and just move like this  And after that we’ll select these controllers  
be like that and it will be like that little  bit of and now we have to work in the fingers   
So, this would be like this, so you have  to just look at the reference and just  
That means you have to work by looking at  your reference and just work for the same   
the most contrasting part and if you look at the  anatomy and one more thing is that in every part  
Now, it is little bit of tilted so I will  select this we’ll tilt this like and this  
we’ll also do the same   
Just select each and every joint, just  move while looking at your reference   
Make sure that it will not overlap like  this so what I will do just control Z  
or if you are in Mac should  press shift Z and after that,  
as you can see all the images  It has some  contrasting part as this is the T form  
and this hand belongs to that contrasting part   Same for this and this leg so each and every part  
Hello everyone 
will be smaller and we will find difficulty to manage 
So, I will just close from here or also you can go to window and just work here because
if you are comfortable then you can work from here 
So, now what I will do, I will go to panel and I will just go to the panel and here you
have the graph editor where is it, here you can find 
So, now its change and if you want to go to your previous panel how you can just right
space bar, right mouse button and you can go to any of your view so that’s very easy
if you want to drag your view you can drag 
Now, I will not require <?>mays</?> another view 
So, I will just put like here and we’ll change the panel and will go to a graph editor
See we are in front view and what we will do 
and now if you select your ball what you are getting, you are getting two translation 
As you can see the ball starts from its initial position which is one and if it <?>goes</?>
as you found that in fifteen frame we have the key so we have to manage this key particularly
this one 
you can just zoom it according to your need 
So, if you want to zoom you can also zoom by scroll so like this way so what I will
do if you select the key if you move forward 
As you can see it’s going up if you select this key which is here and go downward see
it will update 
So, we’ll move little bit like here and we’ll make a new box and just click this
So, control Z or as your the curve will also be like tipped and ball will <?>follow</?> 
So, we will select that particular section and here you can see its showing the white
part between the two vertex or you can say the two key frame so what we will do, here
you have break tangent click over here now you can easily break 
So, what happen see, if I just make the curve like this as you can say this is an inorganic
thing, so you have to make like heart, heart structure or heart shape inside your tangent
and inside your graph editor 
So, break the tangent over here also as you can see what happens next 
Here we haven’t updated the same so will update but at first let’s check is it working
or not, as you can see its now getting tipped, here you can found its getting tipped 
box and move it somehow here, we’ll increase it size and we’ll increase size like this
But after that it’s behaving like yeah weird 
It’s quite behaving weird here because we haven’t change this so what we will do,
we’ll pause this for a time and we’ll go up to here and we’ll change this particular
section, we’ll break a tangent and we’ll move further 
possible to tell each and every thing, each and every panel 
So, you have to keep on experimenting things 
If this would be possible you can do it but these are very simple as you know that each
and every thing will be applied on your particular vertex and to break your or to attach your
or to change your tangent point into the key frame which is also called vertex and graph
and we’ll keep it like here 
editor 
So, you have to just experiment the same, now as you can see your ball is behaving better
as compared to the early 
So, here we have high velocity so what I will do, I will just select this point 
And you can decrease this little bit as you can move from holding your middle mouse button
I will do control Z, control Z 
If you want to move any of the tangent points or any of the vertex or any of the key frame
you have to select it 
And by holding your middle mouse button which is also known as scroll button 
You can just click and you can move easily 
So, now as you can see our box and ball both are formed and I will just keep this ball
So, that’s the main thing and select this tangent we’ll move like here 
So, as you can see I just press the space bar, its forming so irregular shape so what
we will do just click on the move middle mouse button and just move little bit 
So, that our slope will be quite fine 
you can see your view has been highlighted as there is a light greyish color line and
if you select this your view will be highlighted 
So, if you select your ball and just press in this view you can update and you can see
the updates also but if you press here and just click it over here ok you can’t see
and press F for focusing your object and you will just keep over here 
the updates and also you will find some much more difficulty 
So, that’s the main thing you have to just keep the select ball and after that just go
to here and just play forward or play backward 
So, now one more thing is that I will just call all my views here and will update this
laterwards 
So, I will just press space bar, right click hold your right click, go to perspective so
here you have the bouncing ball and now you can have a look at how a concrete ball bounce,
how a rubber ball bounce, how a plastic ball bounce and or how a if the ball is iron how
it get bounce?
So, you have to just see the videos and just work for the same 
Okay 
So, reference is very important if you have reference you can work quite well 
Because live example is very important in the field of animation, in every field especially
in modelling, texturing, lighting, rigging, motion and dynamics 
So, if you have the reference that would be better and one more thing if you go to your
timeline, here you have the timeline 
And right click, by right click you have one thing is that play blast 
So, rather than clicking over here you can go to here which is the setting and what play
blast does, play blast will just generate a video clip and will show you that means
if your file gets buffered then it will just produce a small video clip and will show to
you 
Make sure that you will not collapse if I press four you can see now it’s getting
So, make sure that your encoding will be in H point two sixty-four, which is a video version
so we don’t require jpg image sequence 
So, H point two sixty-four as you can required you can use it but for now I am using H point
two sixty-four and also the size of the video so we don’t required it right now 
You can scale it or even you can have frame padding, what is frame padding?
That means it is of around four 
So, it will just generate and also have the auto backup after every four frames, so frame
padding is there if you want to decrease you can decrease, so I will just put around two 
So, click on the play blast and now you have the particular view, all the view has of and
collapse from here and it is not good so you should just put it over here somehow over
so now you have the video file, you can just check it over here 
short out it 
And so I will off this and we’ll just go here and what I will do, just select this
part again and will go to the graph editor and will change 
So, select this part and you should go to graph editor to change and to have a good result 
here 
So, in this session we will learn about the bouncing ball and also we will learn few of
You press five and here is your ball 
So, if you are dragging something on your viewport you find that all the things, all
the parameters will change that means you have to just freeze all the parameters which
you have worked 
the freeze transform, so what it does, it will just put all the value zero and only
scale value would be one 
So, freeze transform now all the value is zero I will select both of them, modify freeze
transform 
Now, one more thing is that, okay what I will do, I will go to the front view 
the things which we have discussed earlier about timeline 
So, here you have the ground so I will make a new box again and will make the ground as
you can just drag like here 
press four as you can see its lying on the grid and will modify freeze transform we will
not animate this part, we’ll animate only the ball 
So, what I will do, I will just go to five and will select the ball and I will just save
my file, at first we have to just save the file so bouncing, bouncing ball underscore
zero zero one, always make version that would be fine if something happened you can directly
go to your previous version and just correct the same 
So, now we have the scene all the transformation is zero 
So, we will discuss in details about the timeline and also about the bouncing ball 
Now, what you have to do just select and if you want to just give translation value only
you can do it well but I will just on all the thing because I have to just work with
scale or rotation if I need it further 
So, what I will do I will just press S button make sure that you are in one frame and how
you can increase the timeline 
So, here by default which is one twenty, as you can see if you just drag this particular
section you can just have the timeline which is around two hundred so you can zoom this
like, so it will zoom 
So, after one frame, two frame will came, three frame will came, like this way 
So, you can just drag if you want to increase the timeline number that means the duration
So, let’s continue, now what I will do, I will just go to polygon and here you have
of timeline, just click over here 
If you need five hundred just press five hundred enter so it will convert into five hundred 
So, like this way if you are in one eighty-six frame click over here you can go to that particular
frame 
So, I am in <?>two nineteen</?> frame so I will just zoom this like this way 
You can zoom and just focus inside the frame, it will just zoom it, okay so by default which
is two hundred 
So, I will make two hundred so we’ll enter it and one more thing, one more thing is that
here you have the auto key, so we’ll on the auto key because if you are not using
the auto key each and every frame you have to go and just press this S button on your
ball 
keyboard so that it will update or I will just put the animation key on that particular
frame 
So, we will not use it, we will use the auto key, at first I will just press S, S button
on your keyboard as you can see the thing has been animated in first frame and all the
translation, rotation and scale value has been animated 
Now, what I will do, I will just on the auto key and now I don’t have to press S all
three blocks of <?>capness</?> as you can see between one to five there would be two,
three, four so we’ll take three block 
As you can see these are the blocks we’ll take three blocks of times and we’ll just
So, if you click the ball and what happens it will just form on your grid so you just
jump like here and will move further in twenty-five frames it will go down 
here always just put it over here 
Okay 
So, one, two, three and we have four so I have two blocks here and we’ll just put
ball gets down as it move forward and after that some time it will just stop 
two, three, we’ll go here, we’ll go, we’ll go here and we’ll just keep the ball and
put it over here Okay 
we’ll go further, I will go further 
So, I will increase the size I think we have to just shift this forward <?>refine</?> so
as you can see we have the bouncing ball so if I play 
It’s not looking natural so what we have to do, we have select this and we’ll go
to one sixty frame and will put one sixty 
So, after that it will just follow the loop so it’s not looking natural as you can see
it’s not acting natural, it’s not looking natural so what we will do as you in perspective
and for a time we’ll turn off the grid so what I will do, I will just select my ball
and we’ll go to any of the view I think perspective press space bar and right mouse
button hold your right mouse button so as you can see you can change your view so I
Now, I will go to my side view this would be fine and we’ll move, we’ll go to front
will go to front view 
Okay 
So, here is the front view so I need some more space so I will just off this view by
dragging it and will off this view also by dragging it and after that we don’t required
this side view here what we will do, we will go to panel and in panel you have the panel
and in panel you have the graph editor 
You can also open through a window animation editor and here you have the graph editor
but it will float like this 
So, we don’t require to float because we need to fix its position 
Either you can just drag like here but that would not work properly because all the section
I think front is fine 
Hello everyone 
go to the attribute editor for your experimentation and all, for a good result 
So, it’s very important 
Now, I just selected the nParticles, have gone in the attribute editor, so here we have
the nParticles shape one which is by default open 
So, here we have a particular panel called collisions 
That means it’s get collide with each other 
So, collide, we have self collide here 
So, we will on the self collision 
If I press play, what happens see?
The particles getting collided with each other as we can’t see here but we will see next 
inside Maya 
we have the create panel 
Rather than dragging here, what I will do, I will just go to create and here we have
the polygon primitives 
So, I will off the interactive creation and what happens, it will directly create a box 
So, I will just create a box which is a cube and as you can see, it’s created over here 
I will press four, as you can see here, I will just off the grid by here 
Now, if I focus in this part, I need the box to be small 
So, we have two box, the p plane one, sorry, the p plane cube is one is the wall and the
p cube two is the small box here 
So, you don’t have to download it separately 
Press four, press five and press six, go to your smooth view 
one 
thing is that instance replacement  Okay 
So, we will just click over here and what we are getting, let’s see 
As you can see, all the boxes getting ejected out 
Now, our scene is getting heavy 
So, i think we have to change the size of the box because we need more small 
So, just go over it 
As you can see, these are the boxes which we have created 
I will go here 
editor and will go to emitter one and in basic emitter attributes, I will just off this emitter
system 
So, when it’s hit the wall, it will <?>become</?> back 
Now, it would be zero and set key 
So, let’s check 
You found all the panels you can go to nParticle, HumanIK, Mocap 
We need more couple of adjustment here 
is getting lost, because we have been animated this particular key in between them 
So, fifteen thousand from here to this one is getting zero and
set key 
This would be fine 
one and will go to the attribute editor and here we have the nParticle shape one 
We have work it many times here 
So, I had a emission panel, so let’s check 
So, we will focus on motion capture which is Mocap 
Emission attributes, okay 
So, I will open this panel and here we have inherit factor 
So, here is the inherit factor 
So, I will just <?>grab</?> this little bit  I think
two forty it is fine, let’s see 
So, I will go to window, and here you have a good feature and called playblast 
So, it will cache up your memory and just generate a video clip 
So, I will go to first frame, window and playblast 
Let’s cache the thing and they will produce a video clip of that thing 
So, let’s have a look 
So, I may have the run, run motion capture 
So, as you can see, it’s collapsing on the wall and will go to the first frame 
Now, as you have seen, it’s collapsing quite well 
Now, what I will do, I will just click on nParticles as have a look, is it the particle
is selected or not 
So, I think the particle is selected 
which is the rotation 
Here you have the instancer geometry replacement 
So, I will just click the data, press middle mouse button and drag into my viewport 
So, I think these are fine 
So, here we have the rotation option 
So, in rotation option, here we have the rotation and so here we have the rotation PP 
So, will change this 
Let’s check is it fine or not 
Instancer geometry replacement, inside instancer geometry replacement, there is the rotation
option inside it 
Here we have the rotation panel, so we have to check only rotation panel 
So, it will add random rotation axis into the particles, so I will go to rotation PP,
click over here 
Now, it’s been applied to the viewport 
select the character 
Okay, so, I will go to channel box 
Now, this is also important term and because we have to hide this character 
Okay 
and will press s 
As you can go to paints effects, you found all the things which you needed 
Animations_7784
right now because we have use it earlier and we have outliner which is open by default 
We have open it earlier 
And now, what we will do, will select the emitter one and will go to graph editor 
So, how you can go, is going to window, by going to window and here you have the animation
editor and inside it you have the graph editor 
So, it’s a very complicated but it’s not so complicated at its look like 
We have so much more panels 
We will discuss in animation but not in this topic 
These are the presets inside Maya software 
So, in this session we will make character particle dispersion 
We will use some sort of tweakness only  Okay 
Animations_7797
So now, I will select the emitter and we have to just tweak it into graph editor 
So, what I will do, I will go to window and here you have the animation editor and here
you have the graph editor 
If you click the graph editor, you see nothing 
But, if you zoom out by scroll, you see a tangent like this 
So, we have to adjust it right now 
So, what I will do, I will just select this particular <?>follow</?> and will move further,
So, will not focus in this, we will just focus on the motion capture 
let’s have a look 
No problem 
So, we will move, control Z, move this little, sorry, we just have to minimize, maximize
Now, you can turn this thing but we are not doing here because we have adjustment here  So,
to graph editor again 
So, we will go to visibility 
So, I just created this part by clicking over here 
Just put it over here 
Let’s check 
Now, it’s showing, okay 
So, I will press four 
Press five so you can see the character 
nucleus, if you don’t want to see its structure and all but you can see here, the hands are
going like 
So, as you can see, if I zoom, the particles, the size of the motion human is very high 
Okay 
Here you have the character now 
So, that would be a problem 
So, what I will do, pause this for a while 
and because we have on it visibility, if you off the same, it will follow its shape 
So, that would be a plus point 
think this would be fine 
Now, it’s ok 
So, what I will do, I will just scale this down and press F for focus 
It’s getting splashed 
Let’s see 
As you can see it’s producing the particles 
So, like this way, you can tweak your object if you want any powered like thing and you
can tweak through emitter, by going to, you can say by going to a graph editor 
Now, you can tweak, you have all the things here, so one by one you just have to do the
modification and it will generate different result 
So, I think this would be fine 
hang up so, as you can see, at first just produce the power and then it will move 
So, like effects and all, if the character is getting angry and it is producing the power
and will run through the same, you can also work like that and for that what you have
to do?
Nothing, just make sure that you will select the emitter and will go to a graph editor
which is here and will just turn both of them shift by shift  So,
we have just selected the emitter 
If you shift the top part, that means the front part, the first part, this one, if you
shift the first part then it will just produce the power and then move 
If you select this part and move to the back, what happens?
So, I am just selected the controller 
It will just still in stand position and it will just generate the power after going at
as you can see, it’s generating the power 
So, so now you have the idea, how you can create or modify things and just have to do
in the different terms and all into graph editor 
So, you have all the idea that how you can manipulate the things, how you can change 
If you change this what happens?
All the particles is going up and then the character will move and see the particles
is left behind 
Now, what I will do, I will go to a plane and will create a plane 
So, like this way you can tweak and have a good result 
So, you have to work in the graph editor 
That means just select this point, move forward and see the result, select this point, move
forward, see the result 
If you want to move it forward, just see the result what happens next 
So, you have to do a couples of adjustment, like this and if you just drag this down,
what happens, just see 
So, you need a lots of experiment 
Okay 
So, you need a lots of experiment and you also have to work with the character skin,
So, this would be the plane, press six 
go to your this particular part and here you have the small point which is its property
features 
So, you can change by middle mouse button by going up and up and going here and here 
So, it will just animate its visibility if you need more freedom 
From here you can go to graph editor and just have the tangent and all and you can animate
the same 
So, like this way you can add extra things according to your need 
And it’s all depend on you 
So, it is all on you 
So, you can just adjust its timeline and you can make certain key frames for more animation 
As you can see, if I go to hundred frames and now it start running and will hit to the
So, you have all the features as you can see, when it start it’s generating the particles
because we have shifted the you can say, its timeline here 
Okay so, like this way, you may have the modification, select this part, move up here 
Let’s see what happens 
Select this part, move up here, let’s see what happens, control Z and let’s check
the result 
So, you will get all the things 
As you can see, it haven’t generated the particles and because we have move so much
forward and if you move this backward, let’s see what happens 
Now, little bit of particles has been generated 
surface 
So, let’s continue 
Like this way you can work 
One more thing, in this tutorial, you have to examine because we have told you the each
and every parts of this tutorial, each and every panels 
So, you have to experiment one more thing, if you have just created the character and
the particles and the box and the plane, how you can just eliminate these particles, so
that it will not show up here 
So, you can do it 
Well, you have all the parameters known, so you can do it this thing 
This is very simple 
Okay 
When this is at the back 
This two points when at the back, control Z, sorry, the character has generated the
kind of particles and just move forward or when this is at the front, so we have a gap
between them 
So, after that the character run, few frames, then the particles have generated 
So, you can have the experiment 
Only two things you have to do, first select the skin, just move it 
You have the points here, experiment the same 
Make playblast through window and just experiment it and after that you just have to select
the emitters 
Let’s start to work in this 
Then you have the curve which is situated over here 
So, let’s have a practice 
Attribute editor is very important as we have discussed many times that you have to go through
the panels and all 
If you want to change the colour of the character and the particles, you can do it well 
I think orangish is fine  Okay 
Animations_7937
There should be a little bit of transparency 
Now, what I will do, I will just go to box, make a box, click and the man will hit to
Ambient colour should be hide 
Go to assign new material, so for examine I just put that particular colour 
You can put it according to your needs 
Okay, now you can change the colour of your character 
But, I don’t think so I can change over here because I don’t need it 
So, let’s have a look 
So, you can change the colour of the character and the particles, but I don’t think so
the box, and will start getting dispersed 
I need in this part 
So, now you have the idea how you can change each and every thing, one by one, step by step 
So,
you can do it well 
You have to go to the panel of attribute editor and all 
After that you can do the experiment 
So, that would be fine 
I want you to just compose this shot or like same 
You can compose it, render the same, okay 
As you can see, here we have the particles, which we have just click over here 
So, I will just put the box over here 
It’s rendered that particular image 
Now, you have the idea and make sure that whenever you are working, you should save
your file 
So, ASCII is fine, enter 
So, you can change the colour, you can change the character colour or you can even put the
texture 
You know how to rig, how to animate, so you can also apply on your own model 
That would be fine 
Let’s see is it touching it or not 
You can just make the wall more heavier by including the texture, putting some bump map
or even displacement map 
Just put some environment at the back 
Just give the lights 
You know the ambient light, you know the three point lighting 
You know the indirect base or image base lighting 
So, you can just put each and everything one by one and compose the whole shot 
So, that would be much more fine for you 
So, let’s meet to the next session 
Yeah, it is touching 
I think this is fine 
Okay now, what I will do, I will just select the box and will on the nDynamics because
we will focus on nucleus dynamics 
So, what I will make in this session, a character will run across the road and it will just
So, will go to nDynamics and what I will do, I will go to nMesh and here you have the passive
collider, create passive collider 
So, will same do with the ground also 
nMesh, create passive collider 
we will go to show and here we have the joints, so I don’t need the joints now 
So, I will off this thing and each and everything is fine, each and everything is opened, so
I don’t need the joint, because if I select the model, by default or by chance it can
select the joints also 
So, that would be problem if something happened with joint, all the animation will be gone 
hit the wall and will turn into particles 
So, make sure that you just off the joint I am going to show and you have the joint
system here 
Just off it 
And after that, I will go to window and here we have the outliner 
So, I will just on the outliner and will select the run, skin 
And now what I will do, I will go to nParticles, here you have the nParticle panel and will
Emit from object 
So, when I click into the panel, emitter is fine 
Emitter type, this is very important 
So, we will start making it 
So, we need the surface emitter 
So, I will put zero and will go to surface and rest is fine 
So, when you apply, as you can see, this is the particular thing and here it’s forming
the emitter 
Okay so, will close the same and if I check what we are getting here let’s see 
Nothing, no problem 
We will work on this 
So, I will just select the emitter and will go to attribute editor and here we have the
emitter panel 
Before making, I will just go to perspective and here we will go to window 
And in emitter panel, what I will do, I will go to basic emitter attributes 
So, this is the basic emitter attributes, as you can see, this is the basic parameter
property features of emitter 
So, in basic emitter attributes, I have rate particle per second 
So, now, it’s time to us to animate it 
So, I will just put somehow over here, okay 
okay, will select this part, right click, set key 
If you set the key, there would be a red line here 
That means, this particular frame has been animated by you 
So, in window, here you have many things 
I will take around fifteen thousand  Ten thousand 
Okay now, right click, set key 
As you can see, now it’s showing that it’s generating the particles, okay  So,
the nucleus 
Here you have the nucleus and in nucleus, here you go to the attribute editor which
is open by default because I have just worked in the particles 
If you go to general editor, here you found all the things but we will focus on visors 
So, here you have the gravity and wind and what I will do, I will just change the gravity 
So, here you have the gravity by nine point eight 
As you can see, some of the particles getting up, no problem 
And now, I will select the nParticles, so here you have the nParticles which is the
particle source and will go to attribute editor again because attribute editor is very important 
Each and everything what you have to manage, you have to go to attribute editor and do
the couples of adjustment for your own need and after that you will get the results 
So, attribute editor is very important in each case 
If you are doing modeling, texturing, lighting, animation, rigging, dynamics, you have to
So, you can have every presets plugins in visors it’s a stock preset plugin present
﻿Hello everyone and welcome to this session  of Maya two thousand fourteen so in this  
Just go to the attribute editor and do whatever  you want to do or animate the same  So inside hair  
system shape you will get all the things like  clamp, main thing is that and you can increase  
or decrease the values like just select and just  decrease the values  If you decrease or increase  
so like this way you can work for the same   
Now it depends on you that how much you are  doing the same, you can also just select this  
and go to the Lambert click over  here  And also you can change the  
value of the clumpness on your model you can  have good result ok, as you can see it is so  
high  And also the render time will take because  as the value get increased so like this way   
Definitely the fur has its own name because this is  a bear furs, so the bear fur is being written  
But we don’t require this amount, we’ll  definitely decrease the value  ok,  
Display quality would be fine,  hair per clump will be low   
Like this way you can animate,  if you just want to animate,  
animate the same of the grid select this  N seventy-four point x is going upward,  
N hundred <?></?> downward, let’s have a look  
you can use the fur you can use the n hair,  n stands for nucleus  So how you can manually  
just put the hair on a model with the help  of curve specially the epi curve tool we will  
discuss in next class  So hope you understand  the same, let’s switch to the next class 
over there  If now you just rendered  the same, what you will get let’s see,  
as you can see the fur is all over the  model  And now what happens next just go  
here and just have the preset, you can  get the bison, you can the dreadlocks,  
duckling, gorilla and all the things which is  coming across here, you have the color you can  
change the color from here, if you need to change  the color definitely you can work for the same   
So if you just have a look definitely the color  will change and we will get a greenish color   
So the base ambience color all the things are  depend on here, you can change from here or you  
can just have a look at how it is looking or not,  as you can see the fur is increasing quite bit   
You can just have a look so the fur inside Maya  you don’t have to just do a lot of modifications,  
session we will learn about the  fur which is present inside Maya,  
just only have a few tweaking so that it  will just wrap up on you whole model ok   
Now if you just decrease the size definitely it  will decrease, if you just decrease the length  
definitely it will decrease the length  as you can see if I just have a look  
at the render definitely we’ll see some  sort of changes  If we increase the length  
definitely it will produce a huge amount of fur   So fur is basically if you have a whole model you  
can just apply the fur on that particular model  as you can see its taking some time to render  
like this way  Because each and every fur  
which is creating here it has some sort of texture  which is just contracting over default light,  
so it will calculate huge amount of time  So  that’s the thing so I just decrease the size,ok,  
and here we have the length and here we have the  bottleness  We increase definitely the quantity  
so let’s get started  As you can see here  we have the fur panel but fur will only  
of the hair will increase  It is the roll, if you  want to roll it you can roll it, the polar if you  
want to change the direction of the fur   ok,This is the tip opacity, this is the tip  
width and all the things which is come across  the fur this is the clumping and all  ok,  
So beside fur there is n hair  We don’t require  right now n hair you can just paint n hair if  
you need to paint over the fur, we don’t require  n hair right now, I will just have to decrease the  
fur clump shape if you just have like this and  all the things which comes across here    
So you can change from here you can change you  have the n hair you can have all the things which  
is come across the hair and also you can use the  fur  So fur is basically for animal or you can  
use in the hand or the leg the small hairs  You  can’t do so much of modification with the fur  
select this just go to the fur and just  we have three features which is the fur  
apply into the polygon for any of the spline   So for rough purpose I just using a sphere   
feedback and the fur feedback  shape and normal fur shape    
Segments is very important, if you just  decrease the segment only line can be seen  
if you just increase this segment the you can  say the curviness can be seen on your screen   
This is the offset value if you want to  just increase the value, if you want to  
increase the value definitely you can work  for the offset  So like this way you can work  
so we need segment we have increased the segment,  we have detail, you have base color if you need to  
change the base color you can work  for the same, you have the noise  
And also we have many more features inside  you just keep on dragging and just see  
is it working or not like this, many more  things you can just change from here, just  
have a look that how you can change  So this  is the basic tutorial cut so this is the basic  
So here is the sphere if I go to the renders  setting, sorry we don’t required the render  
video that you have the understanding of how  this thing used inside Maya software  And,  
ok, here you have the map width and map  height and here you have the base   
So if you are satisfied with your result you  can bake the same  Right now I am not baking and  
there are more features you can just use  this right now I am just deleting this  
and if you have some shape like  if I just use this sphere and  
just for rough purpose I am just painting some  of the vertexes I think face would be fine   
I am just painting some of the face   ok, This is only for rough purpose  
and just delete the same  Suppose this is the back of the head, you  
can use the fur from here click over the fur click  at first select the whole model and use the fur  
and after that using the fur you just see  your, enter view that what the result you are  
setting, we can directly render the same  We’ll get nothing only the sphere but if we  
getting you are getting like this  So if I just  right click and right click assign new material  
Lambert  In Lambert I have just changed the  color so that will match or you can also use some  
amount of bit map into the Lambert image file  So that it will look so much more natural to you   
Just have the render let’s see as you can see, you  can use the… ok,Now select this fur as this is the  
deadlock fur you can have the same  feature which is present inside the bear   
You can have the base color ok, by default  I am giving this and you have the length,  
shorter length or you have the clump and  all which is in seen by you, you can see   
So you can animate this right click right click  right side key  And just increasing the value of  
you can say just going to forward of the timeline  I just going to the backward of the timeline,  
check the auto key you can animate history  ok,For  it while I will just off the grid because it’s at  
just select this sphere and just go to the fur  and here you have the fur features which is  
the center at just we don’t require the grid right  now we have the clump and all just have a look  
at you can also make some amount of  beard or mustache with the help of this  
fur  Make sure that whenever you working you  just have to select that particular section   
And after that you can apply the same  otherwise it will apply on your own model, ok,  
moving it up and edit delete by type history   We don’t require the history select and so  
here we have the n hair, so this is the n  hair create n hair create n hair option   
Click and you have the beat effects create and  U count  If you increase the U count definitely  
that amount of hair will produce  Right now I am using twenty,  
just click as you can see the process has  done and it is just forming the twenty  
present inside this but at first I will just go  to the edit and delete by type history  So that  
and now I am just increasing the timeline by two  hundred or you can three hundred enter  And if  
we just play the button definitely the hair will  fall as you can see the hair will fall  And also  
stop it and just see the timeline what  you will get definitely you will get this  
so if you are not satisfied with the hair you can  also use to paint some of the hairs like this   
ok,So that would be much more fine and just  go to the first frame and just all the things  
here you have the all the features which is come  across, the clamp and all  Increase the value  
segments, thinning and Lamberts  we increase the value definitely  
it will capture  The main moto for the  hair is that if you working in hair  
you have to select that particular part  Then the hair will form which looks good ok,  
it’s the history which is forming over the channel  box or attribute editor it will all erase up   
otherwise it will just wrap into whole model  right now it has done the same so if I just play  
as the simulation is very high because we have  increase the value and also the quantity of the  
hair, that’s why the simulation is very, very  high as you can see  Just pause for a while and  
select the hair just go to the  attribute and just decrease the hairs   
And as thirty frames is going  over here press S what happens see  
clump width and all it will just cover the whole  area, right now I'm not in increasing because  
definitely the system will get hang up  You got  the points and if you want to do some random  
modification definitely you have to go to the  attribute editor select that particular thing    
I just select this and make sure that you just  click only one time and a fur will generate   
﻿Hello everyone and welcome to this course  of Maya two thousand eighteen Arnold,  
So in the next session we will just learn more  about this light and more about this settings,  
okay but first I wanna show one more thing  is that when just you render the same  
okay as you can see we have rendered  the same so here we have a setting bar,  
click over the setting bar you will get the  gamma and the gain which is the exposure   
So you can change the exposure from here it  will effect your scene definitely it will  
produce more dramatic result so here we have the  exposure and gamma value, we just rotate the model  
definitely it will update on your scene  So you  can change from here to have a look and also here  
if I go to the render settings, we have the  camera AA diffuse specular and transmitter  
and sub-surface scatter volume indirect   So increasing the camera AA value will let you  
smoother result, so in the next session we will  just use this, use the camera AA value and also  
So we just putted the model into smaller size  in between the grid and now we’ll just select  
we’ll use the sub-section-surface scattering  because both will work same and also both have  
the good correlation with each other  So  specularity if you need more shininess you  
can increase the specularity which is present  inside this and you have the diffuse also   
So and the transmission like his way you  can change and also you have to go through  
many various properties from the attribute  editor, so in next session we’ll looking all  
the property features of the attribute  editor of Arnold inside Maya software   
So I think this part has been captured by you  because it’s a very simple and you know the basic  
fundamentals of Arnold which we have learned in  this session  You can just use the same thing on  
the model and here we have the render setting,  so in render setting we are use to change the  
render using Arnold, by default Maya software  will be there because Maya software is by  
default and you can change to Arnold  So, all  the panels will be changed, you have Arnold  
renderers system AOVs, diagnostic and common   So maximum time we will use this Arnold render  
especially in sampling because we have camera  AA diffuse specular transmission, sub surface  
scattering and volume indirect  So what are  these values we will discuss this in later wards   
I will just cut this off and if I don’t render  the same, so I am rendering it from here  
so you can see its forming nothing  because as we have not using the Arnold  
shader because we are in Arnold render  engine so we have to use the shaders   
so in this session we will understand  the Arnold process inside Maya software   
So I will just select the whole model and now  what I will do right click and here you have the  
assign new material  So in assign new material  you have the Arnold shader  So, I go to shader  
and here you have the all the shader which  comes around Arnold  So we will discuss the  
shader later wards but at first this is one  of the most basic shader which Arnold have  
which is aiStandardsurface, you can change any  of the property shader through this shaders   
So I am just using the shader as when the  shader is been implemented all the features  
has been came on the attribute editor right side  of your screen  So we are not changing anything  
right now we will change it later ward but not  right now  We’ll just put the colors somehow into  
little bit of greyish like nature and you have the  weight you can increase or decrease the quantity  
So let’s get started as you can see that we  have imported a model and this doesn’t have any  
render settings so what I will do let’s change  the color little bit of it and also as you can see  
we’ll just do one more thing here we have the  Arnold panel  So I will just click over here,  
you have the interactive render view if  I just click over here whatever you do  
the changes it will update on you view  screen so right now it’s now showing   
No problem right click, assign new material  again and shader aiStandardsurface   
And so for a quick examine  purpose let’s just start on this  
it not showing no problem we’ll show this into few  minutes  So here we have some of the lights which  
Arnold have so I am just forming the area light  if I just click and just drag it over here   
Just select this light and if I just go to the  setting as you can see your model can be seen  
decrease the value you rotate definitely  your render view will also update    
texture  So right now what we will do, we will do  the Arnold render engine and also we’ll understand  
So if you rotate definitely your view will rotate,  if you just off this nothing will be happen   
So this is very good in Arnold as you can see  small grains forming on your model because this  
is due to the camera AA value which is set into  three  If you increase this value definitely your  
render would be so much of more smoother and also  it will take some time  So maximum value you can  
put to eight to ten okay not more than that  otherwise it will hang up your whole scene   
If you have a good PC configuration  then it would be okay, otherwise  
you can use eight nine okay so no problem right  now I will just off this  If I just form a ground,  
so I just form a ground I just select this light,  move it somehow here as you can see let’s select  
this ground right click assign new material  Arnold here we have the aiStandardsurface,  
let’s have a look if the reflection is  coming on the ground, we don’t have to  
few of the property features of Arnold   So at first I will just select all the model and  
render in this view, you can render but right  now I am not using I am just avoiding it    
And we just go to the Arnold tab and here you have  the interactive render settings click over here  
you can see the model is showing  here also it has some sort of shadow   
When model is in the air because  there is no any contact between the  
ground and the model  So I just put the  ground to be somehow like this as you can  
see light is bouncing quite well  So if you  want to change the color definitely you can  
just have to go to attribute editor  Here we have the color so you can change  
the color according to your need so just  change the color and you can select the slide,  
you have all the features like having the Mental Ray   all you can just have all the features like  
intensity and all so instead of increasing  the intensity I will just duplicate the slide   
just go to edit and here we are into delete by  type history  So all the history will be erased  
move it somehow here  You press seven  you can see the light inside the Arnold   
So at first you are in six, if you press  seven definitely you can see the light   
No problem so I will just rotate the slide little  bit like this way you just put it somehow here  
and change the color of the light no problem  definitely you can do anything inside Maya  
software  So it’s just zoom in the character  and just see is it working quite well or not   
As the intensity of the light is very  low this is not showing properly,  
if you see the reflection of the blue light is  forming just below the over there  Okay    
Just select the light and increase  the intensity if you want to increase  
definitely you can click over here and just  click intensity would be ten  Let’s have a look  
is it working well or not as you can see now  you can see the proper texture of the model  
and the model is between the grid and make  sure that the model is in you can say low  
and you can also see the reflection of the light  which is forming at your model  If you just rotate  
this, you will find the blue bounciness  which is forming on your model  Okay    
As you can see here and the background is darker  because nothing is doing there in the background  
and also the light getting fade off because  Arnold blend smoothly inside your software so  
that means if you have to change the each and  every part definitely you can select this part  
right click go to assign new material and you have  the aiStandardsurface  You can change the color  
from here or even one more thing is there you can  use any the image file or any of the bitmap file  
which is present inside create node tab  Okay  I like that of the Mental Ray version  
and as you can see body is combined in one  no problem right click assign new material   
So now I am not focusing in all of them I  am just focusing the aiStandardsurface you  
in size because if you increase the size  definitely it will take the huge amount of  
can change the preset from here you have  the preset, you can change the preset   
If you need glass you can just have the glass or  just if you need the Frosted glass, clay, chrome,  
anything if you want to need definitely you  can change from there  Okay  No problem    
Just have a look what kind of texturing is formed  here as you can see the glass we have just change  
the preset of the aiStandardsurface to glass  and it showing the glassiness of your model so  
it is quite little bit of naturality as  you can see  We haven’t use any kind of  
different thing we have use only the Arnold  few modifications and also two light with  
low intensity  So we haven’t modified the same  we just used and just putted on the scene   
So as you can see its working quite well  and also the reflection properties are  
quite natural and okay if you need to do some  amount of modification with the attribute editor  
render time  So if you can decrease the model  size definitely your scene will be lighter  
definitely your result would be so much of  good  I am skipping this and just closing this,  
select this and just go to the aiStandardsurface,  you just go over there all the presets have  
you can say the inbuilt property  If you  change the preset just using the bubble,  
all the property will be  change, definitely yes   
This would happen you can change the color  from here right now I’m not using the color  
as you can see it has been implemented  on your model  So like this way  
if you want to add some amount of texture  definitely like in Mental Ray you can also just  
select that part go to color click over here and  just put any of the texture if you want to put  
definitely you can  So it depends on you  what type of things you need to do  Okay    
So as you can see we have just use two Arnold  lights and one simple material into the scene   
and also your model which you are making or  just forming inside Maya it is a vector   
﻿Hello and welcome back to the animation  course on Swayam platform  In this session,  
It is an art that is often display and celebrated  in the film festival all over the world   
It is also used commonly for educational purpose  as it has a big place in the learning and  
instructional application  To really understand  the size of 3D animation, you must understand the  
mathematics behind it  3D animation consists of  varying properties of a three dimensional scene  
defined in a numeric quantities   A 3D model can change properties such as position,  
rotation, scaling and the surface <?>*</?>  An  animated 3D scene is a defined by the change  
of this scientific properties through time  We  can do the animation with several methodology   
Some are traditional animation  In traditional  animation, illustrators draw picture on a  
straightforward bit on a paper, fit it on to the  light box, utilizing by the color pencils    
Animators usually test animations with rough  drawings to see how many frames they would  
we will learn about the Production Pipeline of  3D animation using Autodesk Maya application   
need for the animation  The animation  process of traditional animation is time  
taken and expensive also  Once the drawings and  clean ups and in between frames are completed,  
the production would move on to the capturing  each individual sketches  But, nowadays  
traditional animation can be done on a computer  pen tablet and it doesn’t require the photography  
of each and individual frames   There are several application  
available into the industry which you can use for  the traditional animation purpose  For example,  
TV Paint  It is a free animation software   Second you can use the Toon Boom Harmony   
Toon Boom Harmony offer a user friendly set of  animation program that has capability for advanced  
rigging system, the frames and also camera  tools  You can use the Adobe Photoshop also    
Usually photoshop is often overlooked  when considering as an animation software,  
Animation is a field of art or science  that has the capability to impart life to  
but it is really powerful drawing capability  which makes it a great choice for frame by frame  
Disney style animation  Second methodology,  you can go with a 2D vector based animation   
The 2D vector based animation is used when  referring to the traditional hands on animation  
with integration of computer vector animation that  adopts the technique of traditional animation    
2D vector based animation means the computer  generated 2D animation  It uses the same work  
flow as traditional animation  But it gives  you the benefit from the lack of physical  
item needed to make the traditional 2D animation  with availability to the computer interpolation  
to the same time  You can use the Adobe animate   Earlier the Flash software or Toon Boom Harmony  
were 2D vector based animation    Then third option of animation could be  
motion graphics  Motion graphics is a quite  different from the other type of animation   
non-living characters  Basically, it is based  on the phenomenon on persistence of vision  
It is not character or a story driven animation   It is the art and the science of creatively moving  
and animating the graphics element or text  It is  usually for visual presentation or a <?>*</?> video  
or the commercial advertisement, or it could  be used for the promotional purpose also   
Adobe after effect is the most common  software for 2D motion graphics    
But for 3D motion graphics, generally you can use  the cinema 4D or the Autodesk Mass application   
Next animation option could be the stop motion   Stop motion animation is also referred as the cut  
out animation or clay animation  Stop animation  is turned by taking the photo of the object and  
the moving just a little bit with a new pose  or position and taking another photographs,  
then process repeated simultaneously and when  the photos playback into the sequence it gives  
an illusion of motion called animation   And next and most advanced technology is 3D  
that allows the visual  illusion to the objects    
computer animation  3D computer animation is also  refer as a CGI or computer graphics imagery 
There is a famous quote by John Lasitar, computers  doesn’t create the computer animation and  
any more than pencil creates pencil animation   What creates computer animation is the artist   
The animation is completely different  than traditional animation    
The 3D animation require an understanding of the  same principle of movement and composition  But,  
they also require the technical skill while  traditional animation require you being an  
amazing draftsman but the 3D computer animation  doesn’t  3D animation is more similar to playing  
with a puppet rather than a drawing  There  are a number of other distinct process  
that require to produce a computer animation   Often, this must be accomplished in a specific  
order and this is called the pipeline  There are  three stages of animation production pipeline   
So in single line, we can say animation is the  illusion of motion  3D animation has become a  
First is the pre-production, second is the  production and third one is the post production   
In pre production stage, we do planning about  the story, concept, character, the pre-production  
team will take its time to make sure to tell an  engaging story with interesting characters    
So in pre-production stage, our entire planning  stage should be executed  After completion  
of pre-production stage, now it is time  to the production stage  So in production  
stage, we do create the 3D elements for movies,  games or video  There are seven main stages of  
animation production pipeline  First  is the modeling  In modeling, we do the  
model as per reference which we had created  into the pre-production stage  So by default,  
when we do any model in any 3D application,  usually its generate into the grey color    
After modeling stage, it requires to put some  colors onto that model and that is called  
vital part in film, television and the video  games  And it is becoming an integral part of  
the texturing  In texturing, with the help of  UV, what we do, we do wrap a texture into the  
model  And after completion of texturing, now  it is a time to do some light onto the model   
So in lighting a stage, there  are several lights available  
into the 3D application usually it is a omni, spot  light, fresnel light, point light and all    
So with the help of these lights, we create a  scene aesthetics look and feel development of  
our model  So, after completion of modeling and  texturing and lighting, now it is a time to do the  
bone setup into the model  So bone setup is the  process, or we can say the rigging is the process  
where we do add the bones into the model for the  movement of the character  When our character bone  
setup or the rigging pipeline has been completed,  now it is a time to move our character as per the  
requirement of movie or the scene   So, it is a call the animation   
other industry that may not have found it all  that useful at first, field such as medicine,  
Or in a simple term, we can say animation is  the illusion of motion any kind of movement,  
what we are seeing into the real world or we can  say into the television or the computer screen,  
it could be part of animation  After completion of  animation, now it is a time to add some secondary  
motion or we can say secondary animation   For example, hair and fur, clothes, water  
stimulation, fire stimulation and all  This are  a category of dynamics or affects pipeline    
After completion of dynamics, now it is a time  to convert entire 3D data into image sequence or  
into the video form  So, with the help of  camera available into the 3D application,  
we convert entire data into the image sequence  or into the movie  After completion of rendering,  
now it is a time to post production  stage  So in post-production stage,  
we do merge the 3D elements for the movies,  games, videos to the live action footages    
architectural and even forensic  are now using the 3D animation   
There are two main stages of  animation post production pipeline,  
first is the compositing and last one is the  editing  So in editing stage, finally we do cut  
the movie, the footage as per the requirement of  the story timeline of the movie  Now it is time to  
get know about the Maya history, future and  their application using into the industry   
So in next session, we will  learn about the same 
In addition to use for entertainment purpose,  it is considered as a form of art    
﻿In this second module of animation, you will  learn about the Autodesk Maya history, future  
are much more easily prevented this way   Now, let’s move to the scientific animation   
Scientific animation is a field that is similar  to the visualization  In this field the Autodesk  
Maya is used for technical illustration   Maya also use Autodesk Maya application  
for their pre visualizations of a space ship  and the space related content creation also   
In many instances this involves to use cartoon  or technical rendering engine that produce clean,  
crisp and technical rendering   In general, these renderings and animation  
are highly accurate and very realistic,  look like original photographs  Autodesk  
Maya has all the tools necessary to address  this film to watch directly out of the box   
Currently forensic and reconstruction industry  is also using 3D animation tool Autodesk Maya  
for their purpose  Forensic  animation is one of the first  
Autodesk Maya also follows the basic element  of CG  Maya is a large and the complex program  
industry to make 3D graphics utilization   In this industry 3D graphics are used to recreate  
car accidents, <?>*</?>, or even  accident into the work place also    
In general, this type of animation are loaded in,  
but highly accurate in the timing of  the animation  Details keep out all the  
renderance to make them clearer and perspective  jurors and expert witnesses  Numerous new keys  
future addition and architectural enhancement  complement these three major initiatives    
It make Autodesk Maya an ideal  tool for 3D animation industry   
A highly tuned animation system allow artist  to bring their ideas to live with the most  
advanced tool for modeling an animated  characters  Currently web graphics industry  
and the animation industry also moving to the  internet also  Along with this gaming field,  
compared to the other 3D application and it is  a really really powerful to create 3D character  
a new field that it Autodesk Maya becoming a large  part of its graphics that is their graphics    
The 3D animation are used to create websites  such as realistic shopping malls where you can  
walk through a store, pick up the item, look at  them and eventually you can purchase them also  
through online payment methodology  Now, moving  to the product visualization  This is also similar  
to the architectural rendering  In that product  can be designed and tested in 3D software    
Then rendered to show the investors after the  design is drawn up, a 3D artist will create a 3D  
model of the product in the 3D design software  to test its construction  Then a visualization  
animation will be created to show how the  product will work and how it is assembled if  
needed  Currently it is time to augmented reality  and the virtual reality also the mix reality  In  
augmented reality and the virtual reality, a user  looks at the world, sees 3D elements as a treat   
animation  For example, if you have watched recent  movie like Transformer, Terminator, Harry Potter  
Virtual related technology and  developing a benchmark pace    
But, what challenges needed to become over for  the VR experience to fill truly emotion as you are  
actually feel there  However it is not impossible  to imagine a future where synthetic contents will  
be able to react to as an event interact with a  real world in the same way  Hope now you have a  
clear understanding about the Maya application  and their upcoming use into the industry   
and all, the maximum movie artist has used a 3D  animation purpose Autodesk Maya application    
In this session, I will describe the fundamental  to intermediate so that you can easily understand  
the all commands in detail  Maya was originally  a next generation animation product under the  
development of earlier research  It was based on  the advanced visualizer power animated and the  
Alias sketch  The <?></?> was quoted to the IRIX,  the coding process of code name as Maya later on   
Then it has been joint with the Wavefront  Technology and the Silicon Graphics    
Walt Disney futures animation collaborated  purely with the mass development during its  
and the application of Autodesk Maya into the  industry  Computer graphics, CG has grown into  
production of Dinosaur  Disney has requested also  that the user interface of the Maya application  
should be customizable, so that  a personalized work flow would be  
able to create it  This was the particular  influence into the open architecture of Maya  
and it also partly responsible for it  becoming so popular into the industry    
Maya was charging per sheet license that  was thousand of dollar per year 
Early in its lifecycle, Maya made  some stunning market expansions   
Maya one point zero was released in nineteen  eighty eight  Then it usually referred to  
the Alias Wavefront technology and  the name was Alias Wavefront Maya   
It has quickly won the high profile clients  also, such as Industrial Light and Magic and  
the Tippet Studio  They were previously  using the software application    
the include of creation, storage  and the manipulation of models   
But, after a stunning customizable option  with Maya application, they have shifted  
to the Autodesk Maya application  also  Previously that was Alias Maya   
In the early stage of development, Maya started  with TCL as a scripting language  In order to  
leverage a similarity to Unicel language  But,  after the merger with Wavefront, the scripting  
language is Wavefront’s Dynamation  It was chosen  as the basis of MEL, Maya Embedded Language    
A recent version in Maya like two point  seventeen, or two point eighteen, Maya  
support two programming language  First is the  Maya Embedded Language and second is the Python  
scripting language  The software was initially  released for the IRIX operating system only   
However later on, this would be available for  
Macintosh PC system, Linux PC system as well as  for Windows also  This support was discontinued  
Until the early nineteen eighties, the computer  graphics were very expensive due to the cost of  
in two thousand six, after release of six  point five version of Maya application    
And it was available into the market with both  name, Maya Complete and the Maya Unlimited   
Well it was turned into the single so Maya was  acquired by Autodesk in two thousand five   
Since two thousand five, Maya have been several  changes developed by Autodesk groups   
In nineteen ninety eight, Maya has been through  many iteration and some confusing with the names  
of Complete Maya, Unlimited Maya edition   It made its way for Windows and into a Mac OS  
version also  Now, the Autodesk Maya  settled into the single version   
On February eight two thousand eight, Duncan,  Johnstam, Julia and Martin received an Academy  
Award for Technical achievement  for the design and implementation  
of Maya cure systems also  So, Maya is a really  powerful application which industry use for the  
hardware  When the Voom PC was introduced,  the scenario was completely changed    
animation and the modeling purpose   Now before move to the further, we should  
know about the basic system configuration which  require to run the smoothly the Maya application   
Now, Autodesk Maya support the Window Mac and Lan  platform also  The recommended system requirement  
for the purpose of running the recent version  of Autodesk Maya smoothly are shown below into  
the table  Intel four i five or later version   Processor should be minimum of four GB of RAM    
The hard disk space should be a minimum of twenty  GB available for the Autodesk Maya application  
and your computer should add additional graphic  card support also  Either that would be available  
with motherboard or the external  Overview of  Autodesk Maya has been discussed earlier also   
Maya is an extremely powerful modeling  and animation tool  It combined all the  
necessary tool into the single user interface  that is easy to learn and easy to use    
Even after nineteen eighty, the small  industry could also think about to producing  
Maya is used in every industry, air view  pipeline and 3D graphics  The application of  
Maya are as follows  First, film and videos are  two most exciting and the fastest growing area  
into the 3D graphics world  The 3D graphics  are also used to provide many different type  
of effects from the virtual fire, to virtual 3D  character, to virtual <?>*</?>  Autodesk Maya is  
useful to pre visualization of shot in the  both of films and the video industry also   
If you have a scene of movie Matrix, the entire  pre visualization of Matrix movie has been done  
with the Maya application  Two primary type of  films are created in the 3D animation realm   
First is the fully 3D animated film, and second  is the live action integrated film  Sometime it  
called the visual effect based film also  In  fully animated film, all the visual elements  
are on screen and created into the 3D animation  software and then rendered and then we convert the  
the broadcast quality output  Because of the  growth of 3D, three dimensional computer graphics,  
data with the help of editing into the watchable  video version or the image sequence version    
Example of the 3D animation video movies  are Toy Story, Monster versus Aliens,  
Shrek, Up movie and so on  When we talk  about the live action integrated movie  
or the visual effect based movie, it typically  shot with the real character, but the background  
and the other effects are computer generated   For example, Transformers, Jurassic Park,  
Sky Captain, World of Tomorrows, Drone, these  are the some examples of visual effects film    
Recently if you talk about the  Indian visual effect industry,  
there are several visual effects based movies  have been making blockbuster into the industry   
Some of the names are Bahubali, Shivaay, Raone and  so on  Now, let us move on to the gaming industry   
The video game industry enable artists to  use 3D software to create virtual worlds  
you have affordable 3D content creation  options available into the market   
and the character that will be  played in a video game engine    
The industry is massively popular and it is  a profitable industry as like a film industry  
also  In gaming, Autodesk Maya is being used for  low polygon character modeling or the creation  
of areas and the architectural backdrops  In fact  nowadays people perform Autodesk Maya also to give  
content creation due to the flexible environment  of Autodesk Maya and their programming interface   
Video games created for a smartphones and tablets  typically take a few months to develop    
But, when they develop a large program such  as Gear of Wars, Prices might it will take  
two to four years to develop the entire game   Many of the tools available in Autodesk Maya,  
that have a special hook in they specially for use  by to the game developers only  This make it easy  
for game developers to work with vertex, colors,  expert animation data and their game engines   
You can create camera based modeling, plugin and  the autonomous characters and you can generate  
It is also really very useful to create low  polygon model to use into the game engines    
We can easily convert our quad model into tries  and with the help of Maya polygon options,  
we can restore the try model into the quad also   Now let us move o the architectural visualization   
In this type, each and every person want to  see their dream home before construction   
So architecture visualization help them to  watch everything before entire completion  
of real project in real environment   Architectures have been using computer added  
design CAD software since nineteen eighty to  help the create and better more stable design  
for architecture pre visualization  With  Autodesk Maya, architects design engines  
and film artists can show their clients  exactly how their project will look in future   
This saves not only time and money, but  makes the clients happier as design flaws  
realistic, hyper realistic quality content also,  like for example, Hulk, Transformer character    
﻿Welcome to third module of  animation  In this module,  
right, up and down   So, when you have to work into  
the orthographic view or the viewports that  is called the few dimensional viewport also   
It shows the four side which help the top, the  side view, the front view and the back view  
of any object  It is used to move a line, rotate  a scale of the model into the 3D environment   
It has only two shortcuts to get  navigation into the orthographic view   
First is the alt and the right mouse  button, in shortcut you can say the RMB  
plus alt also, to zoom in and  zoom out the viewport    
And you can use the MMB, middle mouse button to  turn left, right or up, down of the viewport   
For centering your object, you can simply  click the F button to focus the object from  
the keyboard  It is really very useful function  to bring the particular model which want to  
help line  We can divide Maya graphical  user interface in these sub-elements    
work into it  It will bring that object inside  the scene to your attention and centered into  
the viewport  By pressing the F button, it will  exactly focus your object into the viewport    
Hope now you have a better idea  about the Maya viewport configuration  
and now you can easily navigate with the  models or you can easily work into the  
graphical user interface of Maya application  after completion of this module 
So, let us start to discuss about all elements  one o one  So, we are getting a start with the  
menu sets  The menu sets are the type of  menus, categories are modeling, rigging,  
animations, effects and the rendering  Here  you can see into the drop down list, this  
all modeling, rigging, animation, effects and  rendering options are available  Accordingly when  
you hit on modeling, related to modeling, you can  see the several options in top up manuals    
When you hit on to the animation, according  to animation, the menu has been changed   
The Autodesk Maya first seven menus are fetched   And rest change on the menu set, you choose  
accordingly  The menu contains both tool and  action to work into the Autodesk Maya application   
The main menu is that the top up Maya window   There are several individual menus are available  
you will learn about the Autodesk Maya graphical  user interface, the navigation tool in Maya  
for the panels and the option window   You can also access the menus in the main menu,  
or you can use the hard box also with the help of  hitting the space bar from your keyboard  
Here you can see the hard box of my application  Directly  you can navigate all the menu with this hard box  
option  You can activate the hard box using the  holding down the space bar into the view code  
status line  The status line contains icon for the  common use of command such as object selection,  
snapping option, rendering and more   Moving to the shelf  The shelf contains the tab  
that represents its menu shelf  The real power of  shelf is that you can create custom shelfs also   
Then it make shortcut to quickly access within a  single click  For example, if you are working on  
a model, then you may require the modeling related  options  Then for retesting the render testing you  
may require are render icon over there  So, you  can customize your own shelf with the help of this  
and we will also discuss about the view  code configuration of Maya application   
shelf menu and accordingly you can customize  your own shelf as per your requirement    
So, this is really very very interesting feature  which you can utilize and for the upcoming  
practical session in Maya application  Side bar  icons  The side bar icons are the right end of the  
status line  It open up the tool to the attribute  editor  The tool setting and the channel box you  
can access with the help of side bar icons  The  view panel, the view panel offers the different  
way of viewing the object and to view seeing   You can also display different editors into  
the view panel  For example, you can use the  respective view, where top view only  You can  
shift this one respective view with hyper  shade view also  You can switch this one  
respective view with graph editor also when you  are using animation  Moving to the channel box,  
you can edit attributes  You can animate the  value for the selected object  In channel box,  
So, let’s start to getting know the user interface  UI of Autodesk Maya application 
you can majorly work with the object  position, rotation and scaling    
But in channel box, you can also there are  some options available like their visibility  
and the component attributes also  The  layer editor have two types of layer options  
in Maya application  First is the display  layer  And second is the animation layer   
Display layers are used to manage the object   For example, if you have to manage the visibility  
and the selection ability of the object,  you can use the display layer options  But  
when you have to work on to the animation,  then you can use the animation layer    
Animation layer are used to play, lock or mute  multiple level of animation also  Moving further  
to the tool box  It’s a really very essential  graphical user interface part of the Maya  
application  The tool box can help you to select  and the transformation of object into the scene   
The Maya has a interface element that group all similar  commands together  For example, all the commands  
and to show the manipulators and you can use the  Y button to access the last tool also  The quick  
lay out button help you to switch between the  useful layout of the panel within single play   
Here you can see, this are the quick lay out  options are available into the view board   
With the help of quick layout button, you can directly  work with the outline end perspective that  
consists to the hyper shade perspective  These are  the some templates available with the quick layout  
button  Now, moving to the time slider  Time  slider is a really very useful for animation   
It shows the time range  The time  slider also display the current  
time and ease of the selected object   We can select the key and drag it also to  
the new frame to the change of animation  frame also  With the help of time slider,  
for controlling the view code are grouped together  into the view code navigation control    
you can set from where your data would be a  start to animate and where it should be finished   
But there is one more option here, you can see,  called the range slider  The range slider would  
be the appropriate option to use for play <?>*</?>  to set the animation  Therefore, we can easily  
modify or correct the animation to focus on  a smaller portion of the whole animation    
So, when we evolve with a range slider, we  can easily work in a small part of animation  
after correction of that small part, then  we move further to the next part  So,  
when we are working onto the project, range slider  is really very helpful options when we are working  
onto the big projects  Now, we are switching  to the playback controls  The playback controls  
is available into the right corner of the  graphical user interface  It help you to play,  
pause of the animation as  defined by the time slider     
The Autodesk Maya is really very complex  software, so Maya has been divided into  
You can go to the frame first and frame last also  with the help of playback control also  You can  
go to the next key frame, to previous key frame  also with the help of playback control option   
Animation and the character manuals  The animation  or character manuals are help to switch the  
animation layer and the current character set   We will discuss this animation character manual  
in detail when we will work on  to the animation module    
Moving to the command line  When we are working to  the Maya dynamics, or effects part, then command  
line help to get input the Maya embedded language  or phython tap down into it  Before work with a  
programming interface, we should be familiar to  the programming language also, to work here into  
the application  So, in command line you can  directly write your script and you can execute  
also  There is a separate script window also  available into the Maya to writing the script    
When you are working into the big project and that  time, you can get utilize the script window also   
Left and last is the help line  The help line  give you the short description of the tools  
as you can scroll over the into  the graphical user interface,  
when you over lay the mouse into some  options  For example, move tool, you can  
get the details about the move tool, selection  tool or the rotate tool over there    
This bar also help you with the steps required  to complete a specific tool of work flow   
The viewport in Maya is very handy to use   And it has two different navigation viewport  
which is perspective and the orthographic  view  Now, I am going to teach you,  
how to use the viewport and the navigate in  it  If we want to work in to the viewport,  
we should press the space bar to maximize the  viewport and the restore to four views    
Just put your mouse pointer inside any of  the view port and gently press the space bar  
to maximize it and restore of the viewport,  again hit the mouse pointer into it and hit  
the space bar button  For full viewport, you can  hit the control and space bar simultaneously to  
get in into the expert view also  You can do  the particular view of maximizing the viewport  
with the help of control on a space bar  Now,  switching to the perspective view navigation    
Perspective view navigation which is also called  the 3D view also  It is a primary view and the  
main view to work into it  It is the essential  and the master viewport perspective navigation   
There are some basic shortcuts which you can use  when you are working into the perspective viewport  
to get work with your object or the model  For  example, alt and left mouse button for rotation,  
alt and right mouse button for zoom in zoom  out, alt and middle mouse button for turn left,  
range slider, playback control, animation  character menus and command line and finally  
﻿So, let’s start with the Maya graphical  user interface in Maya application   
You can use alt B to the change the background  of the viewport  Or you can use the window  
setting and preferences,  display background radiant  
also to change the other display setting  such as the grid and access x, y, z   
So let’s create a basic 3D object into our  viewport so we have something to look at   
Go to the create polygon option under the top  menu and click and drag to create a sphere   
Or vice versa you can create a  box or several standard primitive,  
you can create with the help  of this menu options    
Make sure that interactive creation is check on  the polygon primitive menu, else what will happen?  
When you hit on to the polygon sphere,  then automatically the sphere polygon  
would be created into the centre of the grid  that is zero zero zero coordinate system   
Maya is an incredibly powerful software that you can  use to create almost everything you can imagine   
To move around it our viewport, we have few  mouse navigations, you can use the alt and  
left mouse button to tumble the view  You can use  alt and middle mouse button to track the view    
You can use the alt right mouse button to zoom  in or zoom out, or the tolly* the viewport in  
or out  You can also use the scroll wheel or pull  the left middle mouse button to zoom in zoom out  
the viewport also  These tools are also available  in the menu at top to our viewport under view  
camera tools  Sometime, we want to see our model  from different views to get different perspective  
on the things to layout the geometry properly   Hit the space bar, quickly you can sharp the one  
viewport to the four viewport, that is you can  individually hit the single perspective view  
to four viewport including left top, front, side  and into the perspective viewport  Vice versa,  
when you roll over the mouse into any  viewport and when you hit the space bar,  
The purpose of this session is to help you to  become familiar with the basic user interface  
that viewport would be the maximize  Tap the  space bar while hovering with any viewport,  
minimize or the maximize that viewport   Note that if you have hold the space bar,  
the hot box option would also popup  This special  menu will be come to play later on  We can do  
all facility, we can do entire controlling of  Maya menu set with the help of hot box also   
The three basic dimension in three  dimensional space are x y and the axis   
The top front and the side viewport allow  to see our scene without geometry distortion  
as a scene into the perspective viewport by  default to stimulate the virtual camera    
You can use the F keyboard button to feel  selected object, or you can say the focus  
selected object into the current viewport  You  can use the a shortcut to frame all object into  
the current viewport  The Maya user interface   The Maya user interface setting and preferences  
and the feature of Maya, so you can start  creating beautiful work or 3D art work   
allow you to change the several settings with  the help of Maya setting and preferences options  
including interface and UI elements   You can use the interface or UI element to change  
or disable or enable the various UI elements   There is an option called the display kinematic  
manipulator polygon  You can use this option to  display the size of different UI elements  You  
have an option called the setting camera  Setting  camera can use to change near clip, far clip  
or the distance of the object seem to disappear  as they approach to the virtual camera   
Setting rendering, with the help of setting  rendering, you can change the default renderer to  
software to mentor ray, to hardware, to the toon  render  Setitngs undo  You can use the settings  
undo to get a maximize the number of undo levels  also  But, when you increase the number of undo  
level, it first uses more memory or your computer  maybe little slow also  Creating Maya projects   
When you first open Maya application,  you will see this dialog box here    
For creating Maya projects, you can go to the  file project window to create new project    
Here, you can see all the location and you  can set manually the location and  
name of your project, Maya will  automatically create all the necessary  
sub folder within the project folder  For  example, scene, templates, images, source images,  
video folder etcetera  So, you don’t have  to create the manual lays folder later on   
The name of sub folders corresponded to  what you should have save into them    
If you have to save any scene into the  Maya application you have option called  
control S through the keyboard shortcut,  or you can use the file and save button  
to save all the scenes, to save all the files you  are working on, save within all the scene folder  
of your project  You can use the shift S to  save a copy of that file also  Maya save the  
To disable this in Window, you have a feature   Click on the check box, add the button, and next  
file into two formats  First is the mayaAscii  dot ma  And second is the mayaBinary dot mb    
Many time you want to create different version  of your scene file, so you can go back into the  
previous version also  For going with this scene,  we have an option in Maya called the incremental  
save  So with the help of incremental save  you can also enable automatically save it,  
preset interval by going window setting and  preferences  You can hit onto the interval minute,  
how often to create or save new file   You can save the limitations of auto share  
also  To export your geometry, from Maya  application to some other application,  
here we have an option called export selection or  the export  So, when you have to select particular  
object into the another format, then you can  use the export selection  And when you have to  
export the entire scene to other application,  you can go with the export all option  By  
time when you will open the Maya application,  this start up option would not would be here   
default obj export option is disable   In setting you should go into the plugin  
manager and you have to check out the same  to get access the facility of obj export  
into the Maya application  Viewport  setting and the selection modes   
To change how your object are display within the  viewport on the panel toolbar, go to the sharing   
Some of the options we have to display objects  are four shortcut for wireframe, five for shading,  
six for hardware texturing, seven for lights  When you have to require the wireframe or shaded  
option, display wireframe outline or shading  same time with the help of this menu option,  
you can hit on to the same and you can get enable  the wireframe on shaded also  If you have pressed  
eight by accidentally, it will switch to the  paint effect, so don’t worry about the same   
Again come back to the perspective view and  you can work on to the same application    
Navigating the Maya viewport  When Maya opens  you will see a 3D view with a blue and gray  
So, four shortcut for wireframe help you  to see through your geometry into the  
display as an outline  When you hit the five  button, your shaded display geometry color  
and the polygon nerves and the shading  information you are able to get from the same   
When you hit on the six shortcut, your  hardware texturing, that means if you  
have applied any texture on the model, you are  able to see the same into the viewport    
And with the help of seven numeric keyboard  button, when you hit on to the same,  
light would be enabled  And if you have create any  lights into the viewport, now light also effect  
the model into the viewport, and you can see the  real time output into the viewport also 
radiant background  This is called a viewport  and it is where all our 3D graphics, 3D objects,  
cameras, light, background and anything are  created with the help of Maya application    
﻿You can hit the drag a mark Q around onto the  
you can use that drag on the ring x, y, z axis  again unable here with the selected object   
And you can use the yellow ring to rotate into  the ring as space around the current view also   
When you are hitting on the R shortcut from the  keyboard, now it’s a scale option are enable   
So, again you can drag on the cube to select  across the axis or the center yellow cube to  
a scale uniformly across all  To move or a scale  along with two axes at once, hold the control and  
drag on to the axis you don’t want to add this,  or move ever across the area you are  If you want  
to rotate object around, then you can hit on  to the move tool, so you can get notice that  
pivot of the objects into the world space, and  rotating the object into the object space    
Now, world space means that transformation bridge onto  the global scene axis, which do not change   
But, when we talk about the  object based transformation  
top of object to select anything that include the  mark Q box  If your object is get selected and you  
or object as space, the transformation based on  local object axis, which will change every time   
Here, you can see the channel box, channel box  display transformation and allow us to import as  
specific value of transformation  For example,  if we have to move your object, you can simply  
put the value into the position, rotation or a  scaling  Translate x, y, z axis or rotate x, y, z  
axis by putting the value into the channel box  Sometime, we want to reset all the setting into  
the channel box to zero, without changing our  object position, rotation and a scale  So, do the  
same what you can do, go to the modify and the hit  the freeze transformation  To reset all the value  
and here you can see into the channel box, now  your object may be moved into some newer space   
But, after hitting the freeze transformation, the  entire value would be zero, zero, zero axis   
So, now it’s a local corner system or it’s a  base corner system of that particular object   
want to deselect, you can use the control click  to deselect the object also  For transforming the  
Now, if you have to modify any object into the  component level, we have the some options  There  
are two basic modes for which you can manipulate  your geometry object mode and the component mode   
Object mode is for object wise transformation  of one or more object, y component mode  
help you to component transformation of which part  of an object there would be moved  For example,  
when you work into the component mode, you  can get work with a vertices, faces, edges,  
UV, vertex face and so on  So, in component mode, you can work with  
the polygon <?>*</?> or subdivision surface  You  can hit the right click on the polygon model to  
switch your object between selecting the vertex,  the faces, the edges, the UV’s, the vertex face,  
the multi or switch back to the object mode  All  of the selections and the transformation options  
of object mode can be alike individual vertices,  faces or edges into the component mode to get  
objects into the Maya application, we have  three options move, rotate and scale 
reshape your objects  Under the move tool  setting a scroll down and turn down, you  
have an option called the soft selection mode  So, soft selection mode allow you to have a smooth  
fallout from your selection  This can  be very useful for reshaping your object  
with smooth and tube surface  The yellow indicates  full selections, black indicates weak selection   
Adjust the fall-off mode, radius and curve to  change how the soft selection tool would be react,  
using the attribute editor  The attribute editors  allow us to see the different bit of information  
about the whatever we have selected  to across the attribute editor   
You can hit the control a or command a for  Macintosh PC to get enable the attribute editor  
button in top of the status line with an  option selected, the attribute editor will  
display a lots of information  For example,  transform nodes, shape nodes, creation nodes,  
So, now let’s go over how we can transform  the scene and the position of our object   
material nodes and all  Transformation node  will help you to get info about its position,  
rotation, scale into the three d space  You can  get this to the shape node, it gives you the info  
about that what it looks like, also available  into the channel box under inputs   
If you delete the history form the delete  history option, this input node will disappear,  
and you will no * able to see this one  option into the attribute editor   
Material node - Material node help  you to get detail about the material,  
which you have applied onto the object  You can  get the chain about the material parameter or the  
shader parameter with the help of material node   The attribute editor’s node change based on what  
object is selected  Within the attribute editor go  to the list at the top menu, and disable auto load  
selected attribute to retain the attribute on to  the given object regardless of a new selection   
Depending on which two are selected, the  manipulator will change its appearance that the  
The copy tab buttons within the attribute editor  allow us to work on to the attribute of two  
different objects at the same  time  Grouping and the parenting-  
for access the grouping and parenting go to the  window outliner to view the list of everything  
into our scene including objects, cameras,  lights and etcetera  You can click on to  
the some of items to rename them also from here  outliner  If you click onto the same plus symbol  
to next of an object, you can see the shade  node associated with that object also   
There are two basic ways to connect multiple  objects together into grouping and parenting   
First you can use the P button or you can go to  the edit option and parent  Parent to objects  
together by selecting the child and then the  parent, and you can hit the P for get parenting   
So, when a child moves rotation and scale  along with also move with the parent object   
manipulator indicates the pivot point from which  the object will be moved, rotate or the scale   
However, you can use the still move of the  child object independently of its parent   
Middle mouse button and drag an object  into the outliner to get under the  
another object to make it child of <?>*</?>  So, simply you can select any object from outliner  
and with the help of middle mouse button you can  drag the object into the another object to get  
parenting  You can use the Shift P to unparent the  object also, or from the menu you can use the edit  
and the unparent  Group give you a very very good  facility to connect all the object into the single  
selections of the object  For creating group you  can use the edit and a group option, to create a  
group containing multiple objects  You can rename  the group to organize your objects in also   
With up arrow selected group containing the  currently selected object  So, when you hit  
the parent object and hit the up arrow, then the  entire group would be automatically selected    
You can hit the W button for move  To get access  the move dragged on to the arrow from the x,  
So, hope now you have a basic idea about the Maya  graphical user interface into the practical  
y and the z axis to move along that axis   You can click the center of the manipulator  
to move along it with all axes at once  For  rotation, you can use the hotkey called E,  
﻿Welcome back to the polygon engineering module  of animation  So, in this module I will teach  
and we can create a new project with the help of  project window  So, here you can see the project  
window available here, so we can easily put  the name with the help of this new button   
When you hit on new button, now these entire  options are enabled to fill the value  
Now, here you can see the primary project locations  options also  By default, whatever file you  
are shared with a Maya application, the  file would be save into the scenes folder   
Whatever, the render images you are  going to render with the Maya software  
would be save into the images folder  You can  change the name of folder also, but by default  
Maya has given you the best preferences  So,  you should leave with this by default options,  
or as per the industry requirement or your project  requirement, you can change these options also   
Whatever, as you are going to use, you should save  entire references into the source images folder   
you how you can create the standard model with  the help of Maya polygon modeling the standard  
Vice-versa for sound, you have a sound  folder  For example, if you are a using  
any programming, the scripting; you should  save all file into the scripting folder   
You can use the movie folder for saving the  video file; you can use the auto save folder  
for save the Maya auto save file options also   When you hit on accept button, now you can see  
in desktop, you are able to see the  folder which you have created   
So, here you can see the  table modeling folder and the  
entire folder has been by default  created with mail workspace also   
Now, get switch how you can create a table  model with the help of a standard primitive  
into the Maya application  In Maya whatever we  want to create, we can use a reference according  
to the same  So, for setting the reference, we  have an option call the view image plane, and here  
primitives  So, I am going to teach how you  can create one of this table with the help of  
these are the option called the import image  And  you can access your reference file from here   
Reopen now you can see your reference  image is available here into the viewport   
You can go to the panel option  and you can use the tear off copy   
With the help of same you are able to make  copy of this viewport, and now you can easily  
so what you can do hit on show, and you can  uncheck the image plane  So, now image plane  
is not available here and your  reference is also moved from here   
So, the viewport is back in easily,  now you are able to create your model  
into the viewport front or left  And easily you  can manipulate the data from the perspective view   
I am shifting this one reference little  back, so easily we can model into the center  
Maya polygon modeling standard primitives  Before  you start to work on the same, first of all we  
of the viewport that’s a zero, zero, zero  position  Now, let’s start with a box model,  
now here you can see the box has been  created  But, the dimension of box the  
height and width of box is little different  than the reference images they require   
Now, move the same and scale it  as per the reference requirement   
Now, here you can see this box has been little  modified into the shape of table side panel   
Now, here you can see we require this one area,  again here this one box shape again here  So,  
So, simply for that what you can  do? You can select the box  
and you can use the edit options, and there is  an option called the duplicate  Now, the data  
has been duplicated, but in this time the same  object is available onto the same position   
should shut the project  Accordingly, we can save  the file into that project; we should save all the  
So, with the help of move tool you can  shift your object into the new location,  
as per the requirement of reference  Here, we  require one more box here, so again do the same   
Now, here you can see this one base  area of table has been created,  
now it’s time to work onto the top of the table   So, for making that you can create one new box,  
or easily we can manipulate the position of this  box from here to use the top view of the table   
So, what you can do? You can simply use the  shortcut control D for duplicate also, and you  
can rotate with the help of rotation option  Here, in rotation you can use the J button from  
the keyboard for snap the rotation  Now,  you can move W for move, and add just  
now here you can see into the perspective view  with top area of the table has been generated   
references into that particular folder also  So, whenever we are going to switch to the another  
Now, it’s time to work on to  the rest part of the table   
I am going to again stress into the move,  and I am going to duplicate the same, and  
shift as per the reference  The scale it  
and adjust as per the requirement  of the model, and now here you can see  
the shelf, the keyboard shelf has been  created, as just as per reference   
Again use the control D for duplicate,  
and now here I am working on to  the bottom shelf area of the table   
Again I am using the duplicate shortcut control D,  
and move according to the reference requirement   And here you can see there is a back support is  
also available into the table reference  So, for  creating the same what you can do? You can use  
computer, entire data should available into the  single folder, and we can easily move the entire  
this one shelf area of the keyboard  And simple you can make duplicate them,  
or you can simply put the value from  here ninety degree from channel box   
Now, easily you can manipulate your position  of this box with the help of top view   
Now, here you can see this one area is now  
classing the table top area  So, here we  require to a scale the same, so scale as per the  
requirement of reference  You can switch into the  wireframe view for better manipulation move it   
Scale it, move it again  
and now the model of the table is completed   So, now you have an idea how you can create  
a table into the Maya application  We have some  references for practice also, I am going to share  
folder to other PC  And then we will open the  file easily, we can get access all the datas,  
both references also with you  So, easily you can  do the practice after completion of this module   
Here, I have two references,  first, table reference is here,  
and second, table reference I have  is this one  So, you have to submit  
this both table after completion of this  module for your graded assignment 
which I was earlier used into the previous  PC  So, before start the project, we should  
create the project here  So, for creating a  project, we have an options into the file menu,  
So, hope now you have a clear idea about how you can model props, for example table, chair
automatically the entire cylinder radius going to be change 
Why?
Because, we have chosen here the instance option 
Now, here we require to scale the height also 
Hope now you have a clear idea how you can make some exterior model with the help of
a standard primitive 
Now, in upcoming modeling session, we will learn about how we can make the add-on detail here 
For example, here this one is small detail is available here 
So, as I discussed earlier that by default image plane is created into zero, zero, zero
This one area is opened here, the door is available here 
These are small detail available here, so according for such kind of detail, we should
switch this model into the poly model 
So, in poly modeling when we work, we can have a several options available to modify
our model 
For example, we have extrude option, we have a prevail option, we have the chamfer option,
we have the edge loop tool 
So, in the next module we will learn about the polygon engineering process 
How we can efficiently execute any model within the Maya software in right manner 
Thank you 
axis 
So, manually you can move your reference with the help of image plane attribute, or manually
you can simply select the image plane, and drag into the z axis 
Now, let explore this one model in later detail 
Now, here you can see this one model could be need with the help of cylinder with low segment 
And the entire this one model could be like a example of octane model 
So, let’s start how we can create this one model pre-visualization in Maya application 
So, come to the channel it and shape mode, and here you will get the input node 
or interior modeling with the help of Maya software 
In input node, decrease the subdivision axis to eight 
in the example 
Here, you can see the reference is going to be high, so what we can do?
We can use the panel and use the tear off copy option here 
And have the polygon from here, here, now here you can see the reference is available
here fine 
So, what I am doing here?
Now, in this second example of Maya modeling with a standard primitive, we will learn how
So, what we can do?
We have a pipe options also here, so for creation of this one center model we can use the pipe also 
Now, it has been created into the center, so first of all let’s move the scene and
again comeback to the input node 
And decrease the subdivision axis to eight, now here you can see it’s a look like the
same as in available into the reference 
drag here the thickness value 
we can create exterior model 
So, manually what you can do?
You cannot scale it and you can increase the height of the model fine 
So, here you can see this model ready as per the reference 
Now, again come to the polygon 
And put the value to two point five, now its little fine 
Here, you can see on top, there is a minority tail like boundaries available over there 
So, what we can do?
We can make duplicate this one polygon, with the help of duplicate 
come down into the input node 
For example, castle or some modern architect 
But, here you can see the input node is not available, so what you have to do?
At the time of duplicate select the model and edit option 
And use duplicate special option and reset the menu and use the duplicate input graph 
Now, here you can able to see the input node also 
So, now here you can see there is a supporting octagonal also available here, so as I had
created one octagonal model here 
with it in this manner 
So, I have a reference here which I am going to use into the Maya viewport as a reference 
Now, select the same and here we require to make duplicate this one, polygon primitive
in eight multiple copies 
So, what you can do here?
Now, it’s as per the reference looking nice, now what we require here 
Select the object and we want to modify the pivot of this object into the center, of the object 
So, what you should do?
You have to go to the select option and you can use the modify, and you can here use the
centered pivot 
But, with the help of center pivot what will happen?
So, let’s start, I am going to use the view image plane and import image 
As per you selected object, the pivot would be automatically set into the center of that
object 
But, what we have required?
We require to change the pivot of the object and we have to set into the grid zero, zero,
zero axis 
So, what you can do, from keyword Hit the insert button and now you can able to modify
the pivot here 
And you use the X for grid snapping, and now here the pivot is moved to zero, zero, zero
corner system 
And when your job is done, again hit the insert button 
And let’s come to the present folder, present fo * and I have a reference of Castel-del-Monte
Now, see what happened here, now the pivot is set to the center 
Now, come down again into the duplicate special option, and use the duplicate input graph
and duplicate is special, hit on apply 
Now, what we require?
We require to make a multiple copy of this one external area of castel 
So, what you can do at it and you can use instant duplicate with transform option 
And now here you can use the J button for rotation snapping, and for last one you can
repeat hit the G  And see the layout of the model is now ready 
The radius should be little less, so manually you have to put the value of all disk model 
which located in Italy 
You can use the instance option, duplicate special 
Now, E and J for rotation, so see now what will happen here, when I change the radius
of this file?
The automatically second file would be also affect 
command repeat, G for last command repeat and J for rotation 
G for last command repeat and J for rotation snapping, G for last command repeat and again
do the same 
So, I will try to create this one model with the help of a standard primitive 
﻿So, in this module we will discuss about, how  we can create gun with the help of Autodesk Maya application   
about sketching  You can do it in rough way,  mix some proper lines including deduct part,  
each and everything  Divide it in two parts,  
which is front one and side one, because I we  have to adjust this into two direction, into two views    
So, it is better that you  should use two drawings at a time   
This one is the magazine area,  which covers with bullets   
The black part is the depth part, that’s why I am  using the black colour to fill these small areas   
So, that if we do the modeling, after that when  the modeling will be finished for finalizing,  
we will use the depth and we will make  some sort of changing into depth also   
After the reference gets over,  we will switch off to Photoshop   
The lines part are the detailed part,  
Gun, have captured human imagination  for centuries and are featured prominently  
so the rough sketch has been completed, the  things has been left  Now, it’s all over and  
in next step we will switch on to Photoshop   
So, there you can see the concept escape of  the gun has been created  Now, in next module  
we will jump into the Photoshop to  refine our reference images 
into the books, films and the video as well as  into the themes  As an introduction to creating  
modeling with the polygon tool, we will be  model as gun with on this side  Whatever,  
routed into the reality or fantasy all great 3D  models are based on some kind of reference    
Before beginning on our model we should  first create a basic rough sketch of  
what we plan to look like  You can use real  gun or fictional one as an inspiration also   
Here’s a fairly basic sketch, we had  sketch out here for use as an reference one  
for the model of the gun  Let’s get started   I am making some lines which is horizontal and  
Through paint tool like I also use the  same, so I am using the paint tool   
Right click, different address, save the file  
again,  
that is  
I make the whole gun part  So, I am using my fast  forward, because you already have idea, how to  
make the perception lines and stroke lines  So, just right click and you will get a stroke  
panel in it, you will choose this stroke after  that a certain line will be formed   
After this stroke line formed,  you should press the delete,  
and what I have to do? Control J to duplicate  this  This part is been displace, so I am using  
I am dragging my image  this one into Photoshop   
control T and move this little bit  So, that  it may look like straight, click and drag   
This is good because in Maya I have to  divide this two parts equally  This is the  
front one and this is the side one  So, I have to manage two parts,  
If you have a rough idea about sketching, you can  also make your own blue print, that’s why what I  
have done  To finalizing a line and have a refined  line, I adjust switch it onto the Photoshop   
I am taking the brush, and make  sure that I have the hard brush   
You some colour correction and it’s been saved  in jpg  Now, I have to turn this reference to  
Maya, then in the next module we will get set up  the reference image into Maya application 
I am just drawing a rough line, so that  I knew have a idea  I am zooming in-out,  
press shift button and click, so a short line  will be form  I am doing this because I have  
made the reference, so the lines are not  so prefect  Because it’s a rough preference  
basically, so for finalizing I use Photoshop  So, that I may have the idea about the straight  
lines and all, because, Photoshop is  very precise in making straight lines   
So, I will not put so much of detailes, but just  general form  So, that I just made the idea,  
so like this I will make whole part of it   
﻿Hello, in this module we will set up the  references into the Maya application 
spacebars going to the perspective   Press five, move little bit upwards,  
just hold right mouse button  Here, you  have assigned new material  Going to lambert*  
the last part here is the colour  Here you  can get a checker box  By pressing this,  
so you can get a file   There would be image folder,  
click over there to text off  Here  I have just put my reference   
Open  It's not showing, cause  I am not in texturing mode   
If you press six, texturing mode will be started   Now see, it's got distorted  Few parts of it has  
been cutted  Of course, the <?>UV<?> has not  been opened or you can simply go to create UV   
There would be a plan re-mapping  Open  this window, here you have the panel   
Just apply, project  Right click hold  the right click go to object mode   
So, I have just make a particular  sketch which is a rough one   
Object mode is what, it  will select the whole group   
W is for movement e is for rotation R  is for scale  Scale is a little bit   
You can also go and have just right click go to  properties can also puts this pixel dimension and  
width and height in your Maya okay  If you go  to channel box, here you have all the things   
If you go to below of it you  have breadth and height okay   
You can also put this thing, but you  can also adjust through this  Cause  
the part you have a sketch, you know better  Each  and everything that how you can manage this  If  
you if you stretch this up, you have to model  it  If you compress this up you have to model it   
That means this part has been created by you  So,  you can manage it by yourself and make sure that  
you just keep for the top of the grid   This will never goes below of it,  
I will divide this to two parts  This one  is different and this one is the site   
say spacebar going to the side view,  
it's not showing cause I am not in texture  mode  Press six for texture mode   
What to do now? I just want to divide these two  references separately and for this I will select  
this up go to edit mesh here  We have insert  edge loop tool or insert edge loop tool  Thus,  
it will insert a particular edge   Now you can easily divide this thing  
and will be separated from this reference   Going to face mode press this one,  
or object mode select this one control D for  duplicate  When duplicated like thing face mode  
Now, a main problem is that pivot is  coming in this way  I need to arrange pivot  
into the centre  So, I just  select this, go to modify   
Remember one thing, if you want to create  your own you can use your pencil or  
There we have centre pivot  Same  with this also centre pivot   
Now if, if I look at this attribute editor, it has  all the different things and it's get mesh because  
new things are being formed   So, by selecting this edit,  
delete by type history  What delete by  type does it will erase a few history  And  
now if you look at this only three parts is been  there and the rest useless thing has been gone   
It doesn't affect your model or your  
work what you have worked in in this  But, it will  delete the remaining unused part, the useless one   
select this go, into channel  box go to poly shape    
If I want to rotate this thing the y part  is rotating  Just press and put ninety,  
pen to have a sketch  Make sure that it doesn't  matter that you have each and every line should be  
There you have the front part, here you have this  side part and together they form the perspective   
I will model in this two* part and we'll  manage the process into perspective   
your straight and perfect  The matter is what the  part what you are making in Maya, that's matter   
I am going to front view this is one front  and this is one this site  Okay, of this  
space bar, go to plane, if I drag this plane up,  
press shift to drag proportionally  Press five  
In this module, we will start our project through dummy model or you can say the basic
This time I am pulling off my reference 
Turn off your grid, through this small icon 
So, this would be the box 
There would be inputs and here is the subdivision width 
You can change the number according to your need 
Simple click on this, right click hold your right click 
There would be a small icon which states x-ray but it is turning off my reference also 
Right click, assign new material there would be Lambert and here is the colour 
If you turn the colour on and the transparent value it will only affect your model not your reference 
Right click vertex 
model of the gun 
These are the vertex, you can adjust the vertex through your reference 
If you hold your right click there would be face also 
By click over this you can easily delete your face for these are not needed 
Go to the prospective, now here is the rough dummy of your body has been generated 
Just drag this and delete 
So, our rough body has been generated 
In next module we will make a grip panel and the muzzle part of the gun model 
So, let's get start 
Now, I have two references which is in the front and the side one 
So, I have channel box and attribute editor 
I just close this out 
By hitting a spacebar, it will maximize the particular view 
Here is the left view and if you go there this would be the turn off the grid 
This would be the box, if you drag this and drag this again it will generate the depth 
By spacebar again you should go to front view 
So, let's get started 
Lambert, this would be the transparency 
Hold your right click vertex 
You can adjust the vertex according to your reference 
For extra details, I may put some extra amount of segments but in later works 
Edit mesh, insert edge loop tool, add extra edges due to curviness among its body 
Go to the front view 
What I have to do, just put one segment at the centre of it, so that I may divide this
into two part 
Now, it's possible to go to face, delete one part 
After that when the model gets over, I just put one symmetry, which is just equal to the
I've already made my dummy model, which is the body part 
first part 
For rotation should go to E button, press E and rotate the model into the reference 
Object mode, go to the side view 
This would be the cylinder which is the silencer part of the gun 
Click and drag, drag again, to generate the depth 
Go to the front view and the side view 
Align it properly 
By pressing R, you can scale 
Go to channel box 
Here, you have the input 
I'm again taking a box 
So, we don't need twenty, we only need eight 
So, I'm going to vertex, move this up at the backward okay 
For extra segment I should go to Edit Mesh where you have the insert edge loop tool,
just simply click and drag to add some much of more edges 
Go to face 
polygons at a time 
Go to edge, extrude, R for scale, scale this little bit 
Go to Object Mode 
Go to vertex 
Extrude and scale this in inward direction 
Select this and move forward 
the last one to move at last 
So, a rough model has been generated 
In next module we will make trigger guard followed by adding some detail into the muzzle
Select this, go to the front view 
and grip panel of the gun area 
Move this a little bit 
Here is the Edit Mesh and you have the insert edge loop tool 
By simply clicking you can add extra edges 
Right click, assign new material Lambert 
See there are the files 
﻿In this module we will give  you the detail of the muzzle  
go to the edit mesh, there we  have to insert edge loop tool   
move this a little bit through the  blue, rotate this now  Again, extrude   
Then we have the insert edge  loop tool  Insert some edges,  
go to the perspective, right click object mode   
Select this particular part,  
<?>needs your base</?>, drag a little bit   
Central align it, go to the perspective   After that <?>lead view</?>, go to vertex  
grip panel by adding trigger part into  the gun model  So, let's get start   
which is edge edit tool, here we  have the insert edge loop tool   
Add some <?>images</?>  Select this part  delete, go to vertex, select the bottom one,  
move a little bit  Same for the top one,  
the last part   
Go to object mode, select this file now in  perspective  So, we have completed the base layer,  
base model of the gun  I am going to channel box,  there at first what I have to do, first select  
the model, go to edit, here we have delete by type  history  Now, it will erase your history content   
Extrude again by pressing R  you can extrude this, inverts   
I'm selecting this particular part, and I  click vertex, select this vertex, move forward   
And again, R  
extrude this in inward direction through the loop   
Select this particular faces  through shifts collecting   
Go to extrude, move this little  bit above this <?>effects</?>    
Now, the central part, again  extrude but in inward direction   
Go to object mode, select this part  
and the side one   
So, at first, I will select the first facing part   
This is the first facing part  Still  this up a little bit  This would be fine   
Going to edit mesh, and we have to  insert edge loop tool, add some edges,  
Now, we need supporting edges  So,  after clicking this a little bit forward  
and the second part by shift  selecting move it backward    
Going to the left view,  
to meet some edges which is between the  model  While going to vertex select this  
particular part and drag this up a little  bit  Same for the bottom one, the backside  
and the front one  This would be fine   
Going to left view again, select this  part move a little bit backward    
Now, we have the top part to be left, so  going to face select this particular face   
Hit on extrude, move this up a  little bit  This would be fine   
Same as the back part, going to face  select this part, again hit on extrude   
right click like, select this  face going to the perspective   
We'll move up a little bit   
Just make it <?>slantly</?>   
Now, it's done  But, at first going to vertex,  after that insert edges  We will make some edges  
for the detail part of the gun  Select this  edge and we have to move this little bit   
In next module, we will create front side  of the gun and adding some more detail  
into the muzzle and the body part of the gun  and implementing symmetry into the grip panel 
By holding shift you can select multiple faces   
Edit mesh, then we have the  extrude  Increase this a little bit   
Select this part, go to this side    
Select the box,  
rotate a little bit  Go to the vertex,  select this particular vertex as M  Move,  
In this module, we will do the *<?>seeing</?>, the modelling of the grip panel and the implementing
Select the faces 
Extrude 
Move this a little bit 
Select this too 
This would be fine 
Go to object mode 
Little bit of adjustment, select this one 
Move forward, oh!
Its moving the difference also 
And select individually 
the symmetric version 
Select all these 
will put some symmetry 
Later on, go to face, select this part and Edit Mesh, Extrude 
Quite good, move this down 
Delete this part and go to vertex 
the vertexes 
So, let's get started 
-
There would be a small gap, better I will manage this later wards because after when
I have to finalize I will look all this, this would be okay 
Yeah, but I will manage this all thing in next tutorials 
Save that duplicate special 
We should maintain through the top part of the gun, forward object mode 
In the next module we'll add symmetry and the supporting edges into the model 
fine, one and four, this would be fine okay 
I have just edit the three, four from five 
edit mesh, extrude, should move forward 
Delete this part  Edit mesh, insert Edge Loop Tool 
-
In this module we will continue with the previous video 
So, we need some segment over here also, so I am first moving the vertex, going to Edit
So, going to object mode again, press three, now the part is looking good 
In next module we will add extra detail into the body and the front side part of the gun 
So, let’s get started, I am selecting this part,
so I am adding into the corner part, so that the smoothness will be preserved and some part will be shown as an harden view 
So, click over the edges corner,
same at the back part, here also
﻿So, in this module we will add extra detail  into the body and the front side of the gun   
So, let’s get started, going to face, select  this part, select this one and this one,  
go to Edit Mesh, Extrude, little bit forward,  
that’s look good, face,  
Edit Mesh, Insert Edge Loop Tool, put some edges  
at the corner part,  
this would be fine,  
Object Mode, check the <?>sub smooth result</?>   
﻿In this module we will continue  with the previous session   
select this part  
or this one, move this a little  bit, this would be fine   
Go to Edit Mesh, there it  is Insert Edge Loop Tool,  
by pressing three smooth result,  
rotate this a little bit, that’s it    
Go to Object Mode,  
isolate this thing,  
select this part and what I have to do, I  isolate it because I have to work in the  
stand part of this gun also, so I am  just selecting a particular part, go to  
So, let’s get started, I am selecting  this part, going to isolate,  
go to Face    
Go to Vertex,  
move this a little bit,  
go to Object Mode, select  this part by pressing one,  
a little bit, I will scale it inwards direction,  Object Mode select this and insert edges,  
like this  Object Mode,  
select this part, this is top grid part and  
go to Face select the bottom part of  this particular grid part and select all,  
go to Edit Mesh, Insert Edge Loop Tool  
move forward, it’s <?>updating</?> in the  
beside of this particular part because I have  already putted the symmetry, so duplicate special  
v or Merge Vertex Tool, I can easily track this  thing or by pressing v also it can be achieved,  
same with this part,  
Object Mode again, due to lack of  segment its getting so much of smooth   
and isolate it, go to Object Mode, select  this part and press three for smooth view,  
press three button and its get smooth,  
Insert Edge Loop Tool   
In the next module we will add small parts  and give detail into the gun surface 
this is the trigger guard but it has a  smooth curve, so I need to add some much of  
edges to its corner, so I had just isolated it   
Go to Edit Mesh, Insert Edge Loop  Tool, put some edges at the corner,  
Go to Face, select this part, go to  Edit Mesh and Extrude it  By pressing W  
we should, yeah, extend it out,  
﻿In this module we will get continue  with the lower <?>spoon</?> barrel  
move at the top, move forward,  zoom this a little bit,  
this would be fine   
Zoom this Vertex, select the all,  
move forward and this one,  move forward, Object Mode,  
make a new box,  
going to Vertex and draw boxes  like this, select the Face,  
extrude this a little bit, rotate this or  downward direction move this up little bit,  
go to Edit Mesh where you have the  Insert Edge Loop Tool, insert some edges,  
and the lower side and the hammer  part of the gun  So, let’s get started  
zoom this a little bit, scale it up and  manage its level, same with here   
Select this one, extrude this downward direction,  
Object Mode, select this, press  three, its smoothing very much,  
I have to adjust at the bottom of the gun barrel,  so by pressing one Harden View has been formed,  
okay, I am having a box,  
<?>we pivot is</?> soft slow, so by bracket I can,  
I can increase the size of  the pivot through brackets,  
through bracket down, the size of the pivot  decreases, <?>add through</?> bracket up  
the side of the pivots will increase, move  forward this is the handle part of the gun,  
so increase the sub division level,  go to Face, select <?>one on one</?>,  
go to Extrude and move forward  by pressing W move forward,  
I have to scale it individually   So, this would be fine, go to the another view,  
I can, I can judge it very similarly  better than to switch the view over, now  
to select the top part I should switch the view in  this particular region, move this up a little bit  
okay, select this one, again  Extrude and move forward,  
this would be fine, what is this?  This is the grid part of the gun    
If I select three, see its  all being smoothing very much,  
that means I have to insert  the edges into its corner,  
so I am going to face, select  the Faces, move this little bit,  
press three, that’s good,  rotate this minus ninety,  
rotate this again minus one eighty,  scale this down a little bit,  
move this   
okay, I will put this symmetry later on  
right click at <?>Face</?> select  this one and move forward   
and we’ll manage it in later wards, at  first I have to complete the base model  
followed by some shot up details, going  to box again, select the box, <?>edge</?>  
hit Mesh and Insert Edge Loop  Tool, yeah here it is   
Hit Extrude, this would be  the trigger part of the gun,  
upload some edges into its corner,  
press three smoothing occur, Object  Mode select this one, press three again,  
select this one, move this a  little bit pivot, adjust the pivot,  
successfully, adjust the pivot through  v, rotate it through r, sorry for e  
move forward or scale forward  through both direction,  
press three and check your smoothness and I  have to add Insert Edge Loop Tool to its corner,  
this would be fine,  
this would be fine, press three,  Object Mode, select this one,  
﻿In this module we’ll make bullets and the  magazine part of the gun  So, let us get started  
select this one and here you have polyCube  
increase its subdivision width  and height by two by two   
Now, its smoothing, so I am pressing one,  go to attribute or you can shut it down,  
Insert Edge Loop Tool, increase  the edges by its corner,  
Vertex, I am switching over the view,  just the front one, select the bottom,  
move forward, Edit Mesh, Insert Edge Loop  Tool at the top part also, go to Perspective,  
scale this down a little bit,  now its <?>prevail</?>    
okay, I am having a box, increase this upward,  
Go to front view, select the  bottom part, increase a little bit,  
go to Edit Mesh, Insert Edge  Loop Tool, edges at the corner,  
so let’s check by pressing three  object mode, it’s not so bad,  
go to Face, select the top face,  base one extrude it up little bit,  
go to Edit Mesh, Insert Edge Loop Tool, set  some edges to prevent excessive smoothening  
at the lower, at the front,  at the top, you should check  
by pressing three button how  much smoothness its occur   
Edit Mesh, go to Insert Edge  Loop Tool, insert some edges,  
move this forward, this one also,  
here also three and Object Mode,  
upward also minus ninety which is  rotate x, scale this down a little bit,  
much more, move this forward through W, upward,  
this one   
Rotate this through E,  
now we will extrude the same, at  first you should check that it is  
alright or not, this face has been left,  so extrude this up, press W and Extrude   
Right click, Object Mode,  
going to channel box, increase its  sub division width, height and depth,  
select this one, press three and have some  edges which is Insert Edge Loop Tool   
Press three, check mode same for this one also,  
Face, I will select the small and the  large part of the face by pressing shift  
and will click on the boxes, by holding  shift we will click on the boxes   
it should match the level, Insert Edge  Loop Tool and insert some edges   
go to Vertex or even Object Mode,  so I have to select this faces,  
go to Face, select this faces by pressing shift  and click, go to Extrude W and move forward    
For symmetry it’s also occurring in the another  direction which is just opposite of your model  
of a particular shape, Edit  Mesh and Insert Edge Loop Tool,  
add some edges at the corner so that it will  smooth but not so high, this would be fine,  
this is fine,  
rotate this a little bit and  check if this is okay or not   
stick this two part and little  bit downwards, move forward,  
right click, Face, select this one  and what I will do? I will extrude   
So, let’s check  
okay, going to face, go to Extrude W  
is the grip part, Insert Edge Loop Tool,  not so corner but yes you can adjust it,  
and move forward, this will  be fine, Extrude again,  
select this one W and move,  
I am putting edges at the corner,  
press three, a duplicate has make,  so I will delete the duplicate part  
okay, something has been happened  so I am control z to have undo,  
so now it’s good, so I will  put some edges once more   
This seems good but we will put edges  at the corner, Insert Edge Loop Tool  
okay, this would be fine,  
now it’s, it’s good,  
select this one and move it forward direction,  
its look good but it’s very much off scale,  so I will scale it  Now, this is fine and  
going to another view, zoom this a little  bit, go to Vertex, select this part  
by holding this, move this a little bit  because I have to align it through the model,  
now it’s aligned 
move forward, Edit Mesh, Insert Edge Loop Tool  Now, attach the corner part, add some edges so  
that it will never get smooth, it have some  smoothness but not so high, press three, a  
rough structure has been formed,  scale this down a little bit,  
I just go to edge select the corner and will extrude it downwards, go to extrude and by
which will be kept inside, for smoothness I will add some edges into its corner 
adjust the later wards, at first we will make the bullet through a cylinder, let’s make
the bullet, once again I am taking the cylinder and move forward, so <?>volume</?> has been
move forward through W 
be much more in size as compared to the other part, so what I have to do select the Face,
three, now the bullet’s shape will be occur, part is some much more of bullet, select this
one, move this little bit, now I have to align this bullet into the magazine, so I am scaling
and rotating it down pressing the value of ninety which is straight angle, move this
little bit and keep it inside 
At first I have to duplicate this after that I will align the same, so let’s duplicate
control D, repeat the result I should use shift D, it
will repeat the result, if you have done control D after that you can do shift D, select this
one, move this little bit and rotate it because your bullet are diagonal, so it will adjust
into the magazine 
Now, it’s looking good, select this one and control G for group, rotate ninety degree,
bit, see the size is very high so I am scaling it down through r and rotate it through E 
Go to Vertex, select this, going to one end just move, this would be fine and delete this
two bullet because we don’t need it and another bullet is there 
See, delete it because we don’t need it, going to Face we will select the cap part
and we’ll increase its length not so high but this is good, right click and Object Mode,
never forget to save your file, so it’s looking good enough, select this one, align
it okay, pressing three and control G for group 
select this one and apply which is Duplicate Special, now the Duplicate Special
one in x direction and apply, now Duplicate Special has been done, <?>apply</?> close,
it should maintain pivot whenever you are going to Duplicate Special, whenever you are
going to use the Duplicate Special, so it’s done 
In next module, we will do the <?>rename</?> process into its part and combine the similar
things into the group 
up through r 
Now, move this, I am making the magazine part of the gun, so I will whole in one part which
is E top one, not in the bottom one, just select only one and extrude it, scale it down
a little bit through r, move this through W okay, center it and if you don’t want
to center it’s okay and delete 
So, now its <?>whole</?>
﻿In this module, we will get continue with the  previous session and we will make the grouping  
this is called Grip Panel,  
select this one  
or this two at first, group this up, this is  
Front Sight,  
this one and the another one control  g for group, this is Side panel,  
the body one, select this two control  G for group, this is Gun Base Body   
Lower Handle,  
this one Lower Grip,  
select this one control G, its group now   
Hammer, this two,  
and combining the things  In this part we  will rename all <?>the *various</?> gun part   
group this up, Barrel Exposed,  
this one Eye Piece,  
this is the Base Body,  control G for <?>grouping</?>,  
it’s not going to group at the  first, this is gun base body,  
I have to make the trigger so I am dragging a box,  
I should add this up,  
just select <?>lower there</?>  
three okay  Go to Vertex select this two,  
move little bit backward, select this  one move backward and this one forward,  
so I have to add some sort  of segments into its corner,  
So, let’s get started okay, I am selecting  a particular part and going to channel box,  
go to Insert Edge Loop Tool which  is in Edit Mesh, add some segments,  
control Z, add segments press three for  smooth adds <?>*5:29</?> rename this trigger,  
select this up, rotate a  little between minus ninety  
S W, go for this view, drag this up, scale  it down a little bit okay, adjust it,  
press R for scale   
And now again align this by looking at it,  
it’s <?>totally</?> fine,  little bit of thickness, scale,  
I have to delete this two reference  because the model has been completed,  
so I should press delete, select this  magazine, move little bit forward   
Now, our model has been  completed, it’s a simple model  
through a rough sketch and you can  also prepare it by your own   
After completion first week  of course you have to submit  
two graded assignments followed by reference  available into the course assignment folder  
for evaluation purpose  So, now get ready  to work on to the projects and give your  
select this part rename it Muzzle okay  Select this one,  
control G for group rename this Bullet,  
and rename this, at first <?>*1:50</?>  group and this is Front strap   
Select this one and this one including the body  part control G for group and for all its group,  
﻿Hello everyone, welcome back to the production  pipeline third stage that is lighting,  
which is a toggle button  So, if a tangent is facing over here,  
it it has higher intensity at this point  and lower intensity at this point 
So, if you click here, you found one more controls,  as you can see it will fall off your light   
render preview  As you can see it’s bouncing  quite well, and we have the darker area also,  
but, we have used only one light, so  we will just close that rendered tab   
Now, if you click over here, your ordinary  light will form without having any tangent    
So, like this way you can just put your light   And obviously you have shadow and you have depth  
map shadow, which will create some depth into,  and ray trace shadow is basically for reflective  
surface or refractive surface  So, for a time we  will check this because we are in mental ray tab,  
So, we’ll learn how we can work with the camera  in Maya application, and we will understand  
so you have to check this  If you select  any object, right click assign new material  
and I will just select all of them at  first  Assign new material and you have the  
Phong E, so as you can see it’s getting reflected  and also you can change the transparency level   
As you can see all of them are affecting, because  we have putted only one texture in all of them   
So, as you can see it's reflecting quite ray trace  shadow, so it will bounce the light quite well   
and what I will do? I will just off the grid and  we will just select the light control D  We’ll put  
somehow over here control D, we will make it back   Ok so, now what else you will do? Go to colour,  
will change the lighting colour by lighter blue   We will change this colour to I think somehow  
white  And now as you can see it has three lights  which is bouncing from here, here and here   
the render setup and batch rendering also here  How we can easily generate image sequence in Maya  
So, if you just have a few  and just look at your render,  
so what you will get? You will get a cool nice  detail  As you can see here three lighting are  
bouncing on your model, and also the model is  producing some sort of the ray trace shadow   
Ok so, you have shininess and also that’s  way you can just work with attribute editor   
If you want to change the colour of  the shadow, if you want any image here,  
you can just go to there  Click here and just  have any image, it will just show over here   
So, if you need mountain definitely it will  show, as you can say a little bit of changes   
As you can see now, it’s getting changes,  it producing some sort of texture also   
Because we have just taken the mountain  reference and just put it over here, so,  
yeah it’s working like texture  Ok so, but it’s  not texture it’s only a map inside your shadow,  
application, after successful completion of camera  understanding and the fundamental of lights   
so each and every panel has its own map  If you  see left, as you can see this thing each and every  
thing has its own map  Ok each and every light has  its own map, so you have the mental ray tab   
If you found this checker box that means it’s  all go to your map  Map means your image or maybe  
which is present in Maya or even in computer  Ok  so, it just go over here and just have the images   
File will just directly call up your file, which  is present inside your system, and these are the  
pre-loaded textures inside Maya  Ok so,  make sure that whenever you are working  
in reflective surface, it should on your ray  trace and so select and see just have a look, fine   
So, now we will just delete this light,  
and we will press six again   
Now, it’s a time to get learn the photorealistic  lighting with the help of Maya IES profile  After  
if I press seven kind of lights working  quite well  As you can see this is a  
torch light, so you can change if you want to  see from the light  You can go first select the  
light, go to panel and here you have the  perspective  So, you have in the perspective,  
but we will go to look through selected  Now, you  are seeing from the light as you can see here,  
the light which is just casting over here  Change the colour to little bit of bluish and  
also the intensity  By default intensity  would be one you have to change it,  
if you need more  If you are working in a huge  light setup, you can have more  So, control D  
will just duplicate this light as you can  see both are forming different lights  Here,  
you have the one light, here you have the  other one, so like this way you can work  
successful completion of this all fundamental  option in Maya application, now it’s a time to  
quite well  And also we will just put it over  here and just change the colour, so as you can see  
as it is producing the light source  and here you have the darker region   
It’s also producing the second light  source, as you can see both are generating  
circle, we will select the light, we will  delete the same, so we will press six  
and here we have the area light  So, area  light by default has the intensity of one,  
but it needs to be increased quite well  And if I  press six, seven, now you can see the area light   
Area light is completely depends on intensity as  each and every light is depend on intensity  But,  
if you increase the size of the area,  definitely it will just affect your scene   
So, if you are decreasing the size, definitely you  have to work in intensity  So, increasing it you  
don’t have to and you have to just down this value  to very low level, so, we will change the light  
get learn some production ready output  That is  we will learn Maya interior lighting and the Maya  
something like this, so this is basically  for window light  As you can see,  
here we the mental ray node  and also if I just have a look   
If you want to see the shape of the light, so  you can see from here  Use light shape which is  
inside area light, inside the attribute  editor area light shape one  Ok so,  
as you can see area light use light shape  and you should have to check the visible   
Ok so, if I change back to your render screen and  what we will get, let’s see  So, as you can see  
this is like a soft box which is present inside  studio, especially the photo studio  So, you can  
work like this, if you are not satisfied with  the shape  You can just off the shape by simple  
going to area light  Use shape of now you can  see the shape, ok so like this way you can work   
exterior lighting in these coming sessions  After successful completion of these all things,  
This is the last light which is present in Maya  in mental ray tab, which is volume light   
Just click over here, it is just like that of a  Omni but it has a higher volume, which is higher  
intensity as compared to the Omni  So, as you  can see it’s not dependant, not your shape, and  
if you go nearby, your lighting will  fall  Ok so, here you have the colour and  
like this way go to shadow, depth  map shadow, now so ray trace shadow   
So, definitely it will work on your shadow and if  you press T, you have the controls of light   
If you press in this button, you have more  controls  If you want to go to your previous,  
click over here, press W, and now you can  move your light  So, these are the features  
and now as you have seen, we has covered the  basics of light introduction chapter  And also  
you have the little bit idea about which light  will affect  How much it will affect and what  
we will learn how we can assign the physical  sun and lights in Maya application for daytime  
would be the shape of the light  So, let’s meet  to the next session for a detailed discussion  
rendering  After successful completion of these  all sessions, now it’s a time to get learn  
the third party render like Arnold, mental  ray or the turtin in Maya application    
or look and feel development, or sometime  you can say aesthetics developments also    
So, as per industry requirement, we will learn any  of these third party application, how we can use  
mental base ray or the Arnold based render  in Maya application  Some time it’s called  
indirect illumination techniques also  Now, let’s move to the module number eleven,  
where we will start from the fundamental of  lighting, and how we can utilize the lighting and  
their use in Maya application  Hello everyone and  welcome to this course, so in this session we will  
discuss about the introduction to lighting  So,  we will start from basics and here you have the  
Maya interface, and so what we will do? We  will go to polygon and we will just do a quick  
setup  That means you just do the quick setup,  so I will normal mode, which is five pressing   
Box, this cylinder  
and one more thing is the sphere   
So, after successful completion of modeling and  texturing, now it’s a time to lit up the product  
So, we have three things and including this  particular part, we have four things  We will put  
somehow over here, we will turn the grid off for  a time  Select this we will put somehow over here   
We will put somehow over here and also just  have to flip over this  So, now for this session  
we will understand the concept of lighting,  and also will just go through its parameter   
Because it’s very basics and so you have to  just work out from basics and let’s start   
I will go to the rendering tab and here you have  the lighting features, which is present over here   
Make sure that you are in rendering tab also  when you go up, you will found all the lighting  
parameters and texturing parameters, which is  situated in your rendering tab  So, that should be  
fine and also you are in rendering, so discuss  lighting one by one  So, for lighting we have  
to go to attribute editor to adjust some of the  settings  So, at first this is the ambient light,  
or the character here  So, here in lighting  session we will discuss the entire lighting  
so clicking over here, your light  will be form at this center   
Now, this light is basically for  lighting a particular area, which is a,  
which maybe a huge or a small area, that  means it will focus on a particular section   
If you press seven, you can see the light, as it’s  a ambient light, that’s why it’s just showing your  
model like this  You can decrease the intensity,  and if you see the render, what you will get?  
We will get like this  So, you have this  shadow which is casting over here and also  
if you want to increase this shadow ray  trace shadow, and just shadow radius,  
shadow rays and shadow limits  So, as you can see  
let’s change the view, as you can see it’s forming  the shadow now  And also if you decrease the  
shadow limits, depth limits, it will not produce  like so hard, and it has some soft corners only   
process in Maya application in five sub module  or sub session  We will discuss the introduction  
As you can see it just faded off, if you  just put around one and let’s have a look   
Just put one, it will just little bit fade  up your shadow  So, right now will be in zero  
and also you have object display  So, we don’t  require this, because we will discuss laterwards   
If you want to change the colour,  you can change from here   
And now one more features, if you go here,  you found the direction light, which is  
second the point light  The spot light which  is third and fourth, so you can change from  
here also  So, this is the area, and now its  changed area and this is the directional  So,  
like this way you can change, so I will  make manually, so I will go to press six   
Here, you have the directional light, it  will click over here, now you found the light  
which is pointing towards here  Ok   So, I will just enlarge this and if you  
of lighting here  Then we will discuss about  the types of lighting in Maya application   
are enlarging the directional light, it will not  affect your intensity, as intensity is very very  
much important in lighting especially in the three  D software  So, as you can see, if I press seven,  
we found nothing but as you can move this  It  really changes the light detail will change,  
if you move this light  So, let’s have  a render and let’s see what happens   
So, as you can see it’s working quite well, and  
if you want to change the colour,  you can change from here   
As you can change it’s affecting your scene, so  you can also change it from here  If you change  
the intensity, you can change it quite well,  and control D, now you have two lights  So,  
in a particular scene, if you have two or  three light that would be better  Because  
rather than having one light at a time,  you should go for two or three light,  
There are several types of lights available  in Maya like direct sunlight, ambient light,  
and you can also add different colours   So, right now I am not focusing in it,  
I will just tell you the features same we  have this shadow and the mental ray   
So, here you have the emit photons, so what  photon does? It will just calculate the internal  
lighting, and also it will just smooth some  of your corners like this particular section,  
which is which has two connections   One is from the model to the surface,  
and another one is the from polygon to polygon  Ok  that means this face, this face one correction and  
this model this part and downward part  So, it  has two connections, so it will just bounce that  
thing, bounce the shadows into the corners  So, like this way you can increase the emit  
photon, but it will take time  And ok so for  a time I will just off this thing and it’s  
coming under mental ray in caustics and global  illumination  We will discuss this in detail,  
point light and so on  We will discuss all these  light in detail in practical sessions in upcoming  
in laterwards  So, here you have the shadow,  so I will just select use mental ray shadow,  
and also you have the custom shaders   
So, we don’t require this, as you can see  the size select and just have a render   
So, it’s completely depend on the direction of  your light, I will increase the intensity by  
seven hundred  So, if you just rotate this, as you  
can see the direction of the light gets changed   If you rotate like this, if you rendered this,  
as you can see the direction really changes if you  change the arrows  That means the arrow which is  
facing here, it’s facing to the model  Light is  coming from here that means this arrow denotes  
that particular thing  In source of light is here  somehow here, and it’s falling to the object   
sessions  After completion of lighting, now it’s a  really very essential to assign or lock the camera  
point light also called Omni  Ok so, I will click  this point light and it just form here, and if you  
go up as you can see a soft type of light  This  is also known as Bulb light, so, as you can see  
it’s bouncing quite well  So, in Maya if you are  using any external source of <?>10:46</?> light  
physical channels, or the environment light, or  the daylight, or night light system  Then you can  
put one or two light that would be fine  But, by using this all, you can’t just have  
a good lighting in from only one light  So, you  have to adjust two or three lights in that model,  
or sometimes maybe five or six  So, it  depends on you, so I will just select  
this light and here you have the colour  So, same  the colour and if I select the light and just put  
or press T button, you found the tangent  which is this  So, as you can select  
the tangent will move and it will direct the  lighting shape, and here you have a arrow  
before start the rendering, or before start the  lighting in any three D kind of application   
﻿Hello everyone and welcome to this course of  Maya image based lighting  So, in this session  
what you have to do, you will go to polygon and  here you have the normals, you have the reverse   
So, you can reverse your normal, now you can see  it happens sometimes as you can see here also we  
have the same problem  And so will select this, go  to normals and you have the reverse  So, you can  
and just do some much more  tweaking in this thing   
So, we will start walking and tweaking as you can  see this part is getting shadowed which is good,  
because we just use only one light  Now, we will  use two or more lights and will just look at the  
render, and after that will increase the  amount of final gather and global illumination   
So, as we have applied the Blinn, it’s reflecting  quite well and  Okay so, will not glow this thing,  
because its morning and we don’t require to  glow all the things  So, what we will do? We  
unchecked that means it is off in Maya   Auto load means whenever you open the Maya,  
will just click this off the thing and will make  some more lights for little bit of bounciness   
And what I will do just go to  the Omni which is point light,  
click the point light and we have just drawn the  point light here  And we will just move it around  
here, will make sure that you are saving your  file  Because saving is very important and will  
just move and we will move here and will press  seven  For examine the light view as you can see  
if you press seven, you can go to the light view   And I will change the colour to little bit of  
bluish, and will change the intensity also   Because we don’t require this amount of intensity,  
and here you have the shadow panel  So, in shadow you have the shadow like  
use ray trace shadow, so it’s on occupying more  things like rate of shadow limits  It will just  
smooth your shadow and you have a  shadow rays also just increase it  
it will load that particular plug-in  So, if you are not finding the mental ray on  
input to right radius ok, fine  Even  you can also work with depth map shadow,  
but we don’t have any map, so just put this off  now have a look  Before rendering the same what  
I will do? I will go to render settings, and  in common you if you go here you just find the  
size  So, I will just decrease this level  of the size three twenty into two forty   
Because we have to examine it after  that when we do the final render,  
will just increase the size by going to ten eighty  p, which is full HD  Or, even you can go to four k  
that will take around a huge amount of time, so,  we will just off this and will do a test render   
As you can see the intensity is quite high,  so we don't require this amount of intensity,  
plus we also have to just work in  this particular section of light    
So, will select the light and will decrease  the intensity little bit, I think we will just  
the render settings, what you have to do? Here you  have the Mayatomr dot bundle  That means you have  
judge that it is looking good or not  If you  are rendering the same, you can have the idea,  
so just put the intensity by I think  two would be fine  Let’s have a look 
to check both of them, if this doesn’t check then  it will not load the same  If this doesn't check,  
then it will not show on your render settings   So, Mayatomr dot bundle is very important to check  
that particular thing, if you want to work mental  ray  So, after switching to mental ray, you have  
all the features and one more thing is that  So, we are using this simple interior  
and you can find this interior model in  Arnold sessions, so, we will just use this  
interior Arnold session also  So, at first what  we have to do? We have just created a camera   
So, I will go to panel and here you have  the perspective, and here you have the  
we will learn about the process of image based  lighting inside Maya application  So, before  
render underscore camera  So, we have created the  camera and we have just set our render view 
Now, we don’t require this film gate, so if you click  over here, you have the film gate just click   
And now it’s fine because in compositing  software, you can add the film gate,  
and here one more thing is that grid  off because grid is getting distracted   
So, if you press spacebar and right mouse button,  by holding right mouse button, you can go to  
perspective  Now, you have the freedom to rotate,  and you can check your render settings and render  
lights and all here  So, I will just take  some more space, because two is fine  We will  
do the adjustment and will just check from  here, we will just render it from here   
So, before proceeding for the same,  one more thing is that make sure that  
just select complete model including your camera   And just make a new layer and just right click  
going to image based lighting, what you have to  do? Just go to render settings and here you have  
and add to select it, ok you can rename this  layer  So, I will rename it int interior,  
like this, if you want to hide your reference   But, we have to do it, so I will just put R,  
what R means? That means it is just reference  the same that means you can’t select anything  
inside, because it is converted into reference  Now, what happens see, I will go to render  
settings, and here you have the indirect lighting  system  So, indirect lighting here you have both  
option, which is image based lighting and physical  sun and sky, so, we’ll look both of them, so here  
you have the image based lighting  So, image based  lighting just click over here and just created a  
dome as you can see here  It’s just created  the dome which is outside world  So, now you  
have the image, so I will call up a image and you  should have at least HDRI images for that  ok   
the render settings panel  In render settings here  you have the option render using Maya software   
So, as you can see we have couples of HDRI  images and we’ll select any of them  If you  
just click over here, we have this image and if  you just click over here, we have this image 
So, you can download or even you can click  with your camera  So, we have these images  
and what we will do, I will go to Maya and  will choose the image and here we in desktop,  
here we have the HDRI images  And here if you  choose any of them, let’s see what happens   
If I select this open, now as you can  see it just overlapped into your dome   
So, you can change the HDRI  
by simply rotating it, you can change the HDRI by  simply rotating it  As you can see it’s changing,  
so you can change it, and now if you look at  your room, what happens let’s see  Here, the  
So, you just go to mental ray and after going to  mental ray, just have all the features which is  
As you can see the light is bouncing so much,  and also we have this roof, which is black   
So, we have to just sort out it and one  more thing is that we will just go to six,  
let’s press the six and just go to here  Here you find that this part is getting darker, so  
what we will do? Will just go to channel  box and will on the reference  Now,  
and in indirect lighting  Here you have  the common parameters, where it is,  
so as you can go over here, we have the common  parameters, which is just decided  And in common  
parameters, you have the render options,  so here you have the render options   
In render options, we have to just uncheck enabled  default light, so what happens let's have a look   
As you can see the default light which is present  in Maya is off, now the image which is outside its  
specially for mental ray  Now, will change to Maya software, if you don’t  
casting some short of light from here  You can  just increase or decrease the level of exposure,  
but I will just put for a time zero, and now  what happens next, I just minimize it  Now,  
you have to select the dome and if by selecting  the dome you can go to attribute editor   
And here you have the detail of all the things  So, you have all the things like advance,  
you have legacy and you can go to mental ray,  and you can have the transform and all  Ok  
so, by selecting this light and one more thing  we’ll go to render settings again, and in indirect  
lighting panel we have to check the final gather  which is here  We will check the final gather and  
I think we should increase the global illumination  by checking it  Final gather map, we don’t require  
And it needs some amount of light also for  illuminating the same, so by having only one  
find your mental ray, then what you have to do   Just go to window and here you have the setting  
light  You can’t even do all the scene lighting,  because you need some more additional lights for  
the same  So, for that what we have to do, we’ll  just go to here and we’ll just select the box,  
and we’ll not select the dome  We will select only  the box and will go to channel box, and will just  
turn the reference on  So, will press F for fit to  screen, now you can select, I will press four   
Now, you have a better look and we will  change, and we will apply few of the lights  
here also  So, here you have the rendering tab  and I will also open the rendering tab here,  
and you have the lighting features  So, it  depends on you, if you select any of the panel,  
it will show its property feature at the top   So, in rendering panel, you have the area light  
which is here  If I click here, now our area light  has formed, you can see  So, we have to increase  
the size of the area light as we will just go  over here, and we will focus on the same   
and preferences and here you have the plug-in  manager  So, plug-in manager what does it means?  
If you rotate this, see your x value is changing,  so we need minus one eighty  And after that  
here ok and we will increase the size, we  will go to five pressing, and will see   
So, what we will do? Will just pass through the,  
I think this part would be fine  Will pass  through the window and just have little bit  
what we will do  We will select  the light and move forward   
I will increase the size little bit, so I will  go to attribute editor by selecting it and  
will go to area light shape  And here you have the area light panel, so  
you can change the light type from here  We will  not change the light type, increase the intensity,  
you can increase from here and you have all the  features like in this section  And so you have  
It means that all the plug-ins’ which are hidden  in Maya, you can just on it or off it according  
mental ray, so you can go to use light  shape  I go here and just make a render,  
that’s why it’s casting so amount of light  We  have to just decrease the level of intensity,  
by default it is one point zero  But, we have  to just decrease the level of intensity   
Will decrease the intensity a little bit and  as you can see our background is bluish kind of  
thing, so we will change it to I think, which is  contour colour as compared to the blue  And also  
one more thing is that I will just go to channel  box, and I will just on this thing, will change  
the texture also, from going to assign new  material and here you have the mental ray  So, you  
have the material also, so you can use the mental  ray materials  But, right now I am using simple  
Blinn, and after using Blinn what I will do? I  will go to Blinn and just use the colour like  
this  And if you are not finding your colour here,  
to your need  So, as you can see the tick mark  is basically which is on inside Maya, and the  
﻿Hello everyone, so in this session we will  start the linear workflow inside Arnold with  
the pixel panel  So, you can work for the same ok  like this way  So, I will just, will not change,  
will cut this, because we have to work  again, and it will just, one would be fine   
Now, what happens next? We have created this light  which is casting from the window  Basically the  
light will fall from the window also, so we don’t  have any kind of you can say glass and all   
So, I just put it this light, you  can make glass and have transparent  
texture in it, or you can usually use any  of the shader  And use the transparent value  
ok and followed by the reflection  So, right  now I have this whole area which is blanked,  
so if I select the camera  It will not select  because definitely the camera is in another layer,  
and including the interior which is locked  So,  I will just cut this thing for a while and will  
off this, because I need more space  So, what I  will do? I will just make another light which is  
you have to zoom out, or you have to  fix the position of the camera  So,  
the area light  As we have told you that we will  generally work in area light in this tutorial   
Because it’s very important to understand  the property features of area light,  
and how you can manage all the things  So, ok  to have a clear view I will go to press four,  
perspective, and in perspective and we are  in wireframe  So, as you can see I will just  
drag this light like this basically, ok and also  we will go to the you can say the scale button  
ok now we have to face this  at the ground level   
That means this particular  error is facing at the ground,  
so if I press seven  You can see it’s collapsing  to the wall, so we don’t have to collapses to the  
wall  Because this part would be fine because we  have to focus in this part only, and I will just  
right now I don’t need it, so if you want to open  it film gate, that would be fine for you  Ok    
drag this  You can see its getting fade off if you  are dragging this, it will crease this particular  
part  Because the arrow pointing at the top, so  I will just drag this down little bit  And what I  
will do? I will just create this light little bit  of yellowish in colour, because we have already  
created this particular light in bluish colour  So, will go to colour and just create some amount  
of yellowish in colour, and also will just put  little bit of yellowish, ok and also the intensity  
which is very important  So, intensity I will  just, ok I think thirty would be fine, so will  
click thirty  And also it will change the colour  little bit lighter, because it’s very yellowish   
Ok fine so, you don’t have to worry for this  particular region, because we will focus  
in this part, which will not be visible, as you  can see which part  Basically if you are working  
in night light the common light, which is  the outsource light will be blue  Ok   
Now, instead of moving here, what I  will do? I will go to the another view,  
But, the opposite light will be form a little  bit of warmer, that’s the main phenomena between  
the night light, so that’s very important   If you have daylight, if the outer light is  
orange then definitely the another, the opposite  light will form, which is bluish in nature  So,  
right now I am going to this particular view  and will set this camera to perspective  Ok  
fine Because we don’t have to disturb the camera  view, as you have disturbed all the things will  
be gone  So, that’s very crucial thing that  you will not disturb your camera view   
Make sure that you are saving your file,  which is very important  So, right now I  
have used this light and will just do one more  thing, instead duplicating a particular light,  
you can duplicate well control D  But I prefer to  make another because we exactly we have to manage  
it according to our need, and also we have to  change the colour  So, right now I will make  
which is this particular  I will press space and  right mouse button and go to perspective  Ok so,  
another light as you see this light is little bit  of lighter in nature, which is lighter yellow   
And now I am making same light here, so  instead of going to this particular   
I will press four to have a wireframe, so what  happens now  If I just press E will rotate the  
same and also will face here only  So, instead  of using one light at a time, you should go for  
having three or four light  That means each and  every light had its own intensity, and each and  
every light have its own different intensity   Also we have some panels, you can adjust it, so  
instead of having one point lighting  You  should go for three, four or six point lighting,  
that would be fine  Because as light  gets attracted to your environment,  
all the things will be visible to its form  And if you are working in the night light and  
if the environment has some short of light,  definitely all the things will be casted  So,  
now I have two views, so I make  some amount of space here, so that  
that means few lights which have high intensity,  few lights which have low intensity, few have  
which has much more lower intensity, that’s a  main phenomenon between the interior lighting,  
especially in the interior lighting  Yeah you  can also work in the exterior like the same way   
So, I just putting the light over here and finally  we have just putted the lighter colour here   
And will put the darker yellow colour  here, so we’ll go to attribute editor,  
and here you have the Arnold light attribute  So,  exactly what we have to do just click the colour  
and the intensity would be a little bit lower as  compared to this one  Because as this is a soft  
light, you can say because the colour is little  bit whitish and this is a hard light  And also  
the property of the light is same,  because we are using the area light   
But, it only depends on the intensity if you have  higher intensity, light will cast more  If you  
we will just focus only this two view  Because  the front and the side we don’t require as you  
have lower intensity, light will cast less  So, because that’s the colour is darker than  
this one, I will decrease the intensity  I think  will go to seven and just have a view, let’s see  
what happens  If I press seven, you can see now  my scene is getting heavier, so I think twenty   
No, not twenty, twenty six would be fine, because  we have to see the render view also  So, now it’s  
casting upward and this casting in the downward  region, will just move it here like this way   
So, let’s have a test render, so that’s very  important, you have a test render, ok so,  
will go to panel, perspective, render camera  One more thing we have to do, we have just light  
which is just front of the camera  So, I will  just move it here and put it somehow here   
A problem if you just keep  on the camera, no problem,  
make sure that your visibility the  light shape visibility would be off,  
have front and the side  So, right now ok one more  thing we have just found this one, so we don’t  
which is very important  As you go down, you will  find that the light visibility will be off, so,  
that’s very important  And use colour temperature,  it will directly go to the Kelvin  So,  
if you have higher value, it will go to blue   If you have lower value, it will go to red   
So, I will discuss this laterwards and  will off this, and will go to this view   
Let’s have a look what’s happening  So, I am  just clicking over here, so as you can see,  
you can see that we have used the eighty eighty  intensity level  And also we have just have thirty  
and twenty six, then also we have some darker   So, I am not using the exposure value right now,  
because we have at least to set the light  As you  can see small grains are forming because we have  
used the lower value of camera AA  If you  increase the value, definitely it will smooth,  
and by following this camera AA, you have to  increase diffuse, specular transmission   
need it, delete  So, now as you can see this is a  small interior and one more thing we have to do,  
And this two which is sub surface and volume  indirect also, so will off this for a while   
And as you can see we have just built some amount  of lights in our interior, and always work in this  
particular view  You can see and have examine in  this camera view, because if the camera will be  
displays and if you are working in the multipass  rendering thing  That would be very hectic,  
because each and everything will be displaced  from its position  That’s going to be difficult  
to manage, so what is multipass rendering?  We will discuss in this multipass topic   
We have separate topic for  that particular one  So,  
I think we should let’s meet to the next session,  so in next session I will add some more lights   
And will just have proper render and will test the  render again  So, let’s meet to the next session 
so ok one more thing we have to do  As you can see this part the bed part,  
if I do F that means focusing, its get reverse   So, what I will do? I will go to mesh display,  
the help of Maya two thousand eighteen  So,  as you can see we are in Arnold tab right now,  
and here you have the reverse, so, I will reverse  the same  Now, problem has been sort-outed, ok so  
this thing will not be reverse because I have just  putted that texture only  Ok so, now what I will  
do, I will just set some lights over here, so that  we will work in this particular view  So, I will  
just maximize this particular one and after that  we will go to layer editor, and what I will do   
I will put all the things in a separate layer, so  I am making a new layer  This would be fine, right  
click, add selected  Now, you can see that we have  separate layers, so I have made this reference,  
so you can select  Ok so, our camera is also  in this particular layer, so accidently you can  
select  If you click over here, you can select,  ok so I am making it reference, and I will delete  
this layer  Because we don't required, now what’s  next? We have this layer which is the interior   
So, I will double click interior, I will rename  this, save, we have to put the full name   
so it will be installed by default when you  install your Maya two thousand eighteen   
Now, let’s start to work in the Arnold tab, so  we can use the rendering lights also, which is  
by default present in Maya  If you are working  in the low version of Maya like two thousand  
seventeen, sixteen, fifteen or fourteen, you have  all those lights  But, if you want to work with  
Arnold, you have to switch your render settings  here you have  So, we have to switch it to Arnold,  
so that whatever you wanna light from the  rendering, you can also work in the Arnold   
So, that means this light can work  in the Arnolds, and obviously yes,  
the Arnold light will also work with the same,  because we are using the Arnold render engine  And  
so for texting purpose make sure that your  camera, diffuse, specular, transmission,  
sub surface scatter, volume indirect  will be always low  Ok if you are working in  
the ray depth that means the ray depth file, this  would not been effect so much  If you wanna just  
So, now what I will do? I have this interior which  I have made, and I have simple shaders and  
lower the value you can, but I think it should  be there because it will not affect so much   
But, definitely it will gonna work, it will  affect your PC and also your RAM  So, it  
basically depends on your RAM and also the graphic  processor unit  So, I will just rename this one,  
one, so that we have the test value, and  after we are satisfied with our result,  
then I will increase this value  Ok so, camera  AA basically when you adding some lights,  
it will just fall off all the lights, that means  it will create some smooth result on your scene   
So, diffuse will produce some amount  of you can say contrasting colours   
So, and specular this is always work in  the you can say reflection or refraction,  
transmission value it will transmit the light  through photon energy sub surface scattering,  
and volume indirect  So, I will put all  them the value of one, I will just cut this   
what I have done  I have putted the  colour into these shaders only  So,  
And one more thing we will go to the common tab  and we are using the, you can say if you go down,  
you have image size  So, right now I am not  using high definition, which is HD, I am using  
six forty, four eighty  This would be fine, ok no  problem and one more thing image format exr   
Exr is a high quality image, so you can work for  the exr, jpg would be low quality and png always   
So, you can work in exr, tif or png, if you  are comfortable with jpg, no problem  So,  
I am putting it exr and by default it’s here, ok  now what happens already I have just referenced  
this particular layer, and put it all the objects  and the camera in this particular layer  So,  
right now I have a camera and the  interior, so let’s continue for lighting   
Now, what happen next, so what I will do? I will put some amount of area light,  
now I am working in the area light, so let’s  start  So, I will make this night light,  
I am not using any type of textures here, as you  can see we are not using any kind of texture   
so what happens now? I will just press five  button as you can see you are not in lighting  
mode  If you press seven button, then we will go  to lighting mode  As the lighting is not present  
and any of the light is not present inside your  scene, that’s why is showing in black colour    
So, I will go to five again and here we have  the area light, I will click over here   
Now, you form the area light which is forming here   And now move the area light here little bit,  
as you can see if I just press F button  We  will found this light which is pointing here,  
so the light will cast from here  That means this  particular arrow will be somehow you can say here   
I will just put it somehow here,  so click and just move it  Now,  
what I will do? I will just put it at the center  and will increase the size and also this one   
Ok so, that no corners will be left,  
I have one small camera setup also here, so as you  can see I am going to panel perspective and render  
let’s have a look  If I press seven, then  you can see small bounciness will happening,  
if I press seven here you can see here  So, what I will do now, I will just select  
this light and will press five again and will go  to the attribute editor  So, in attribute editor,  
you have all the features here, so it’s very  hectic too just scroll it down and all  
So, I will just go to copy tab, so I prefer this one,  this would be very good  Because it will just  
make a duplicate copy of this and will just put it  over here  So, you can have a particular look, so  
that would be much more convenient for  me, so you can work in the same   
So, here we have the intensity, intensity is  very important  If I press seven as you can  
see intensity is very low, ok so now what  I will do  I will increase the intensity,  
so as you can see I am increasing the intensity   But, I think if I press <?>It</?>, what happens,  
camera  So, you can see this is our particular  view, so instead of having bookmark, I will go to  
now it’s lighting proper well  So, and  one more thing I am doing the night light,  
so we require two types of lighting which  is the warmer and the cooler lighting  The  
warmer lighting will be cast inside this scene,  and the cooler light which is the blue light,  
which is cast from outside world  Because I am working now in the night  
light system, and already we have  discussed about the daylight using the  
physical sun and sky  So, right now I am working  in the night light, ok so as you can see here we  
have the features panel  Make sure that your cast  shadow will be on, if cast shadow will not be on,  
it will not produce any kind of shadow  So, each  and everything is fine, ok no problem, and yes  
the colour, colour value is very important, ok  so I will put some amount of sky-blue light ok  
little bit of sky bluish light  And  
the camera  You can also use bookmarks, so if you  need it and here you have the Show film gate  So,  
now what happens next, if I just  go to this particular section  
and already we have decreased the value  you can say the render settings  Because,  
we have decreased all the values and also we are  using very very you can say compressed version,  
which is six forty, four eighty, no problem  Now,  I will just select any of them, because if you are  
selecting here, you have the interactive you can  say interactive render view  So, if I go to here  
as you can see here if you press this button,  you have only one time render  That means if  
you are changing this model, you have to render  it again like this, ok that’s the main thing   
So, if you are working here that means one  time render, so you have this render  So,  
if you are working here, you have some features  of panels like this one gamma and exposure,  
which is also been here  But, you have all the  things like this particular display panel, and  
if you click, you can find this part which  not been renderable  If you want to render,  
﻿Hello everyone  So, in the previous session, we  have just make the lights and just adjusted it,  
you can say, shadow and this also, this shadow is  soft as compared to this one  And the top part is  
getting soft bounceness  And this  part also having soft glow and all   
It’s also spreading its light and we have just  tweak it because we have just a put omni in them,  
which is point light and if you can look  at this particular section cupboard and  
what we are getting, it is also  producing soft kind of shadow    
Now, you can take this image and just go to  the compositing software like fusion and new  
and do the colour correction and all and if you  want png, that would be better or exr because  
this thing will not come like black and you can  put some background thing to avoid it  And, also  
you have the exposure setting, if you can  work with the exposure that would be fine   
As you can see, both the lights are open now   If you just grab this like and after that if  
So, what I will do, will go to the  perspective  We are in, you can say, we are in  
you want to just put some brightness, you  can just work with the exposure  And not so  
too much because otherwise it will ruin the whole  scene  So, like this way, you can work quite well  
and now you have the idea how you can change and  how you can just do work with your proper lighting  
and just have the parameters and all  So, as we  have discussed that, it’s very very you can say  
very different as compared to your render screen   That is not possible to show everything in render,  
otherwise your system will not run smoothly  So, whatever you want to do, just go to a  
wireframe mode and just do all the things and  after that, if you are satisfied with your result,  
just go to the render view and have the values  to be put like not so higher value, but yes,  
and one more thing is that, now it’s time for you  to do something like model and after that just put  
some normal texture and just render the same   So, and after that, you just have to work with the  
wireframe mode and will zoom in this particular  focus by pressing f  And what I will do, I will  
attribute editor and all for the parameters  and yeah exactly  So, like this way, you can  
work with your lights  You have to play with  intensity and also you have to look at the  
proper casting shadows and as you see this image,  none of the shadow is harder  So, each and every  
shadow is lighter, softer, so, like this way,  just put some softer shadow in the interior  
go to press six, select this part and in Arnold  tab or you can go from the top here we have the  
lights, and here you have the mesh light  So, this  thing is there  So, if I click over here, now it  
transformed to mesh light  Now, if you go to mesh  light and have a render, what you are getting,  
you are getting nothing  See, this is  not there  So, we have to just modify it,  
ok? So,  
what we will do, we will just select  this part, go to attribute editor  
and here you have the property  feature of mesh light   
So, at first, go to the light visible and  increase your intensity  So, I will increase by  
so in this session we will make some more  modification in this scene  So, let’s start it   
fifteen and will change the colour  So, I  think little bit of warmer, let’s have a look   
So, as you can see, it’s quite  like spreading in the whole area   
So, if you decrease the  intensity by ten, what happens?  
Yeah, ok, this is fine  Now, for more bounceness and a  
circular type of look, I will just apply one more  light which is by default present in Maya and this  
is the point light  Click over here and just make  a new point light  Just move it like this and just  
move it inside it  So, we have just moved inside  it and we have just situated the point light here  
and I think will just change the colour  to like this and just have a look   
As you can see, it’s bouncing quite  well and also producing some amount of  
shadow here  As you can see, it’s also  producing some amount of shadow here  So, now,  
What I will do, I will just go to  this part which is the perspective and  
what we will do, we will do one more thing  If I rendered this particular section,  
we get little bit of problems, which  is, we want a particular light here,  
which will take the colour of this and will  also remove this section because it’s getting  
weird and also it’s not good in this place because  it is look something wrong  So, we will just  
change this and we will just put a box and  after that we will render the same data    
So, I am going to the wireframe, press four  and what I will do now, I will just go to  
poly-modeling and I will just create a box   As you can see, the box has been created here   
Press f for focus that particular section   So, I will press r and will increase the size  
if I press seven, then it will pop the  lights  Now, if you can see this part,  
Make sure that you are saving your file, so  I will save scene as and will go to desktop  
and here we have the interior  Now, I will  save by zero zero four and save as, continue   
Now, I just make the box and what I will do, I  will just go to six and just select this part  
and go to the Arnold tab and here we have the mesh  light  So, we just make the mesh light and I will  
change the colour by little bit of blueness  and will increase the intensity by twelve  
and also we will do one more thing which  is very important light visible    
So, if I see here, what we  are getting, let us see   
As you see, it’s getting quite bounced  And,  I think we have to reduce the size, I think  
and we just have to increase its intensity also   So, intensity would be I think twenty five, fine   
And just reduce the size little bit because its  going outward, I think it’s quite outward   
Let’s have a look   
Yeah, it is working quite well  As you can see,  here we have the bounceness and now one more thing  
is that we have to just work in this particular  section  So, we will work in this section   
And, I will just render this image as in  png or you can also render it in exr    
So, in png, we will just have this area to  be transparent and in compositing software,  
I will just put some amount of painting  and all or even the outside world  So,  
will just grab this data to compositing  software and we will do some tweaking inside  
this particular pic  So, ok now what  we will do, we will do one more thing  
is that we just have to focus in  this part and it is this thing   
That is the photo frame  So, we will just  put some photo  Take the face, ok and  
what you will get, ok I will just off this, will  go to the render setting and will go to render  
so in colour, I just put a image  So,  file and go over here if I have the image,  
ok I put the image of this particular thing  
and it’s not showing, but it may show in the  render and do one more thing, reverse    
Now, it’s showing, but still we have problem,  will select the face, go to UV, automatic   
Now, it’s the problem gets solved  We  have used the planar mapping  So, now,  
we have to just focus on the top light  So, what  we will do, as you can see, the light is getting  
so much of outside the home  So, will just  decrease the size, as I will go to four,  
and will move somehow over here  ok and for this also, will move,  
and will change all the data by one   So, if I just select the render file,  
As you can see, the problem get sort  outed and now I will do a render and  
also, there is a problem, I think  We have  to change the border colour because it’s  
matching so much so what we will do,  we will just change the border colour   
Will press five, will select this  part, press f, go to six, right click,  
assign, new material, no  At first, we  have to just select the faces, one by one,  
assign new material and here you have the shader  which is inside Arnold and here you have the  
aiStandardSurface and in StandardSurface, you have  
the colour  So, at first I have to just delete the history and  
control s, continue and now,  will just have a test render   
I think it’s fine, it’s quite fine  as compared to the previous one  So,  
if I go to the render data, this part is getting  darker  But still there is light  So, we just want  
one more thing  If I go to my window  and here you have the outliner,  
so you have to group all the  things, so that I will just select  
the lights only by shift selecting, control  g for group and rename this as lights   
Now, already we have grouped this  model and all and these are the camera,  
these are the default light which is present by  default in Maya and now, one more thing is that  
we have to go to render settings  And now it  should be around nine, diffuse should be around  
three or four, specular should be around  
three, transmission should be three, sub-surface  scattering four and volume indirect would  
be at three  And ray depth, each and everything  is fine  I think each and everything is fine   
I will cut the same, make sure that you are  saving your file and will make a new version    
to glow this part and also we will put one box  here in this area so that it may glow quite well   
So, will make a new version  And one more thing  is that when you go to your render setting  
and here you get the common  and in common, where you have  
the image format  So, I will change it to png and  after that, here you have the image size, which is  
present by default, which is HD five forty   So, I will just take this as in ten eighty p or  
even you can work in seven twenty  But I think  you can work in ten eighty p because it’s a full  
HD and you can also work in four times HD, which  is four K  So, I will just put ten eighty p and I  
will just render it and now I will show you the  rendered data  So, will just pause this video  
and I will just show you the rendered data   Hello, everyone  So, as you can see that we have  
rendered the image and we have all the things  like, your bounceness, it’s getting cut off  
because the light which is just beside the  wall and it is producing a soft kind of,  
And here we have a seam, so will just remove  this particular part and let’s start work    
Hello friends 
That means this part 
Ok 
So, on more thing film gate 
Film gate is important 
If you use this part, that would be ok and or can use from here, sixteen millimetre theoretical
and super sixteen millimetre academic, so these all are the film gates you can use 
See, the part which is coming here this will render only this data 
So, I am going to users and just work here 
If you click over here, you find this area which will not be in render, so if you put
your model like this, it will render only this part, not this one 
we can execute the software data into the common playable format 
So, film gate is important to show that whatever you have coming in the view 
So, you have film aspect ratio which is one point thirty seven, this is fine 
And, this we do not have to required it 
This way near flip because right now if I go to the heavy scene then we will just
focus for this thing 
So, you have one more environment background colour 
You can have image plane 
But we don’t require to create from here 
You can also create from your texture menu like going to assign new material and put
some plain texture in the same 
Let’s switch to the Maya and now have look how we can work with the camera and how the
So, these are the common, which is very common features of camera and whenever you are using
or animating a camera, you should always just go to the perspective, at first, I will go
to the perspective, just select the camera 
If you are holding its position and will start from the beginning then you have to do one
more thing 
As you can see, the values has changed because you have just fixed a position so that you
can start your animation of the camera from this 
And what you have to do, we are in first frame 
So, right now will go to the modify and you have the face transformation, so, right now
from the beginning, you have to start from the first frame, after that you can go 
So, as we do in animation, that is very simple, in camera also that’s same 
If you press s button on your keyboard, all the things will be animated and after that
just click over here for auto key 
So, we don’t require to press s all the time in between the timeline 
So, we will just go up here and just move your camera or if you getting any problem,
just go to perspective or camera once 
Just move like that 
Ok so, you have one more key because I am moving the camera 
Hello everyone 
Ok 
We will select again 
So, as you can see, it will just animate your whole scene 
So, in between you just have to put some keys, so that it will focus quite well like that 
nothing will get out of your frame so this is the frame, so, like this you can animate 
Ok 
So, in this tutorial we will learn about the properties of camera 
So, you can just select by pressing space bar, you can select all the frames and can
have the shifting and all you can shift as we have discussed in animation classes 
So, like that you can just shift from one place to another or if you want to just focus
in between them you can press shift and just have shift this, ok like this you can work
and ok 
So, as you can see, we are producing some jerk, because I have just rotated the camera 
If you press control z it will just disable your key or just delete your key by going
to back 
So, like this way you can just add some animations like here and as you can see, that’s going
out of your frame, so it’s not going out of your frame 
So, as you can see, we have just setted a simple scene and this is a interior scene,
For more smooth animation, you need some more time and also if your PC configuration is
good as you are working in a very heavy model, that means each and every frame needs some
time to render 
If you are working in mental ray otherwise if you are working in <?>unwound</?> that
means its takes some huge amount of time 
So, that’s the main thing, batch rendering is very important, that means you have to
cover your project into two or three PC 
One PC will start render from one to ten or even one to twenty and another PC will start
from twenty one to forty 
Like this, this is called the batch render 
so I have deleted this part and I have just made this particular interior 
So, we will discuss this laterwards, but at first we will understand the concept and the
property features of camera more into next session 
So, let’s meet to the next session 
It is a very low detail and have low quality 
So, what else we have to do, we have to understand the concept of camera 
So, I will just select this interior and what happens, will go to window and now in the
Welcome back to the class 
outliner, in outliner, we have just grouped this interior in this, so I will just rename
this int 
Now, we have another group, I should delete it because we don’t required 
Ok so, we have this interior which we have grouped it 
So, right now what I will do, I will just select this interior and press control h 
Ok so, camera basically works, if you go to create and if you go to camera, here you have
three types of camera 
But this is the stereo camera which is entirely different from three types of camera 
This is the multi stereo rig 
So, this both are different 
Today in module twelve, we will learn how camera work in maya application and we will
These three are little bit same 
So, here you have the camera 
As you can see, this is the camera and if you select any of the object and make any
of the object like here 
Ok so, if you select the camera and just go here, move up here and after that, you have
to go to the panel, perspective and camera one, ok you can’t see 
Now, you can rotate like you rotate in the perspective and you can just go back or just
move here and there or just pan across your scene 
So, if I go to this view and just press space bar and right click, go to perspective, now
also learn about the render setup and the batch rendering in maya application 
part is the camera 
So, that means you don’t have to change the camera view and in perspective you can
manage or in left or right or front 
Ok as you can see, if I move the camera, it’s automatically updated over here, see 
That’s the main thing about the camera 
So, this is a one type of camera, will delete this and now, will go to the camera again,
create camera and there you have the camera and aim 
So, if you click this you have the camera which will look at its aim 
This is the aim 
So, you can just move this aim wherever you want to move 
Render setup and the batch rendering help us to execute the inner sequence or the video
So, this will always point towards the aim 
So, this is the camera with aim 
So, rather than deleting from here, we will go to the outliner and will just delete the
camera, because it’s situated in the group 
So, one more thing is that in the create panel, you have the camera aiming up 
So, here you have one more controller 
You can just control this 
It will adjust the aperture of the camera 
As the camera moves, it will fix to its position 
from a Maya application, which can be easily play into the any media 
particular, which allow you to do the banking of the camera, as you can see, so you have
more freedom here 
So, will select this, you can move this as it will directly point like that of camera
and aim 
But you have one more panel, one more feature, you can just bank your camera or you
can even move your camera, wherever you want to move 
As you can see, it’s just following the upper tangent if you want to move, see it’s
following the upper tangent, so like this way you can work 
And now, if you go to the create and you have two more thing which is stereo and multi stereo
It could be on television, it could be on computer or the laptop or the android phone
rig, so we will discuss this in compositing classes 
So, will see this through in compositing classes 
So, right now, what I will do, I will just go to window and go to outliner because camera
has the group, inside the group it has all the control and features 
If you open this, you can find this 
The aim up, these are the locators 
So, will select the camera and will just delete it 
Ok 
So, now as you can see, that if I go and create a simple camera, camera and create a simple
camera, so, if you will click and go to the attribute editor, you find the property features
also 
of camera 
So, at first, I have to go to the panel perspective and camera 
So, you can see, the camera is focusing here 
If you go the angle of view, can see that it is changing and it is updating quite in
late 
So, that means it will take some time to update 
As you can see, our grid is becoming like this 
So, that means, its angle of view is changing 
So, our grid is not changing, it’s changing the angle of view 
So, you can just have like this 
So, converting the three D data or you can say converting the software data, which could
Ok 
So, after that, focal length 
Focal length is that, as you can see, this is the focal length, that means if you increase
the focal length, definitely angle of view will change 
So, like this way you can work if you just move like here and just move like here 
You can change 
You can have <?>see</?>, you can have to just rotate like this 
So, the focal length and the angle of view both have changed, so, I just press control
z or command z if you are in MAC 
So, camera scale, it will allow you to scale 
be easily play into the common medium is called the rendering, where with the help of rendering
Hi everyone  Welcome to this course  So, in this session, we will add a camera and will
decrease the intensity both of them and also will just remove that area light for a while
and just use the physical sun and sky for an examine purpose 
and will change the colour to around kind of velvet type of colour  So, will select
and what I will do, right click, this is also selected, so, we don’t require to select
that part  Right click, assign new material, use the Lambert and just change the colour
to lighter, fine 
select this and delete it  That is the duplicate one, so right click, assign existing material
so as you can see, lots of material to choose from  So, right now what I will do, just select
all the files, go to edit, delete by type, this tray, now it will erase of its <?>s tray<?> 
do random animation in the camera and also will put the textures in this interior which
that colour  So, right now I will just select this part and will delete the same 
So, what else we have right now, we will just select this part, ok so will do the control
here  So, make sure that you are saving the file  So, I will save the file, so save scene
as  Go to batch render underscore zero zero one  So, we have saved in ASCII and now, what
else we have to do?
I have made  And after that will just use the batch render process to render the same 
We will just select the sofa, the complete set of sofa and right click, assign new material 
So, I will put some Blinn so because I need some amount of shineness, so will put the
Blinn  So, after that putting the Blinn, will just change the colour to darker red  As you
can see, now it’s forming quite well  Will select this part and use the assign new material,
Blinn and just change the colour to little bit of bluish and also use the transparency 
to lighter yellow, fine, object mode  So, we have two table lamps we will see laterwards 
So, let’s continue 
Ok fine 
to work, right now will go to assign new material and Blinn and after that will increase the
ambient colour  So, we have increased the ambient colour and incandescence  Will save
Now, what I will do, I will at first go to the mental ray tab and in mental ray, you
see, we have set up the scene 
We have forgotten this part, I think  We have to select one by one, will select this part,
control H  Select this part, control H  Now, I am hiding the panels  Now, will select this
part  I think we have to select all of them  Right click, assign new material, Blinn and
outliner we will just delete this group because we don’t require <?>12:36</?> is fine, and
we have just shift H, then select all, then shift H and go down here  All the things is
have all the features like indirect lighting and all  So, I will not use physical sun and
As you can see, as we have increased the incandescence value of here and it is glowing quite well
and also this part  So, like this we can have some more details and if I increase the incandescence
value and luminosity of both of them, it will just give lights very much  As you can see,
sky right now  I will use it laterwards  So, I will go to the common tab  What I will do
and sky as it will take so amount of time  So, you can use it, well, you have to just
keep the render going on  So, as you can see, it’s working quite well, you have to apply
the lights over here also, here also and we need some amount of main light also somehow
here 
will select both of them, control D, means you get the same and will move somehow here 
And if I press seven, what we are getting this complete set is getting lighted and also
it  After I select this box, will make it over here  Let us have a look  Make sure that
now, I will select all the parts one by one and will start texturing it  Ok 
the object will not float 
assign new material and Lambert because this is basically a carpet and we don’t require
to use the Blinn  This would be fine 
Now, what else we needed? We need one more light, so I think we should use the area light 
simple scene  Ok 
So, I will select all the parts and right now, I will click, right click, assign new
So, we will go to shadow and here we have the depth map shadow, will increase the resolution
and also will use the ray trace shadow  Let’s see what happens  If I press seven, it’s
too much because intensity is very high so will use the cooler colour as in contour to
So, just rename this  We have already make underscore zero zero one  Ok 
will just decrease the intensity level and ok because here the light is going outside
that is why it is not spreading too much as some of the lights is going outside  But here
Hello everyone 
Ok 
So, I will click over here, will go to desktop here I have kept my file so I will just select
any of them 
So, I think I will select this 
If you press seven, you will not found any update in your view screen 
As I will just have a render, as you will see, the intensity of the light is very low,
as you can see 
By default, the intensity of the light will be low 
And what we have to do, I will just select this light, will go to attribute editor and
will just go to the intensity and will increase the intensity 
So, in this session, we will learn about the IES lights inside Maya two thousand fifteen 
As you can see, it’s affecting the background, ok no problem, we will put it somehow over
here and will change the render size because right now, I am just experimenting it 
So, I don’t need HD 
Go to six forty, four eighty, ok fine, and if you look at it, now the intensity is change
it and only affect the ground position, not the whole part 
So, like this way you can add your light and also, if you look at the another thing like
decay rate, if you go to linear, what happens, see 
Click over here and you will found changes, see the intensity of the light by default
has lowered because we have changed it to linear 
If you go to quadratic, it will lower again and cubic also 
So, let’s continue 
So, no decay, I have just selected the no decay and also here is the shadow rays 
We don’t require to increase the shadow rays and it will just take huge amount of
time when you render the data 
So, use mental ray shadow map over it, we don’t require because we are using ray trace
shadow, so we don’t require that particular one 
So, here we have the intensity, you can change the colour from here which is by default same
in all lights and you can just have to put the intensity higher 
If you control D it and just move it from here and what you will get, let’s have a look 
Will change the colour too 
Now, will select this light and will move further 
So, at first I will show you how IES light work 
If you move here, you will found more defined shape 
If you just select the light and move further, that means if you move further, you will not
found any defined shape 
So, if you move like here, you will found defined shape 
Control D, duplicate again and just put it somehow over here 
Ok I am just putting over here and just have a look because we have to experiment it first 
As you can see your ground is getting so contrast but it will not show in the render 
It will only affect this particular part 
So, make sure, it is not showing in the render 
Here, will select the light, control D again 
At first, I go to the render settings and here we have the Maya software, so if we go
The intensity is changed and also you have to just give the defined shape of the light
because the light is not been copied 
If you just move the light from one position to another it will not been copied 
So, select the light, go to the light profile, here you can see it has not been updated 
If you go here, you can see it has been updated but here it’s not been updated 
So, you have to update the light 
Well, if you just duplicate it, your light profile data will not <?>gain</?> 
So, I will just select, go to file name, desktop, find and select this one also 
down in the common tab, here you have the render option 
Go to the light shape, light profile sorry 
We don’t require to go to light shape 
We are changing its profile 
just bouncing the light from here, it’s just bouncing the light from here 
But in live view, if you go your viewport you will found that it’s all white 
It’s like burning, so it will only produce the softness into your render screen if you
In render option, if you go here, you have enable default lighting 
just keep on render and just look at it, now you will get all the details 
Ok 
But if you look at your viewport, you will not find any detail and not find any proper
information 
So, rendering is very important, that means just check your file by one on one render 
Ok so, here you can see, it’s getting darker, this part only 
But in live view in viewport, it’s all white, all contrasted, all burnt 
So, rendering is very important to check your results 
So, in next session we will discuss this IES light into exterior 
So, let’s switch to the next session 
So, I will uncheck this because I will adjust emit the light from IES so I will just add,
I will just off this thing 
and as you look here, what we have 
So, in module thirteen, we will learn about the IES profile and we will also learn how
point light which is omni 
So, I will make a omni and will shift it over here through press seven 
Just go to this position, as if you see the render what you will get, you will get this
circular light, this circular type of light, which is forming by the omni into the walls 
So, I don’t need this, I need the design light like this the triangulate light 
So, this are called IES lights 
So, I need the triangulate light, the design light 
The design lights is called the IES light or the wall focusing light 
we can use the IES profile lights in interior scene as well as into the exterior scene 
So, now, will go downwards, let’s check is it open or no 
It’s not open and will go to indirect lighting and will check both of them, global illumination
as well as final gathering 
So, you off this and now will go to this position and I will just copy the tab so that I will
see exactly without having problem 
So, will go to shadow at first 
So, make sure that your shadow will be in ray trace not in depth map 
So, we don’t require depth map 
We require ray trace and if I go to a mental ray tab, here you have the feature called
light profile 
So, IES profile help us to generate a beautiful artistic shape of lights, whenever you are
This is the one of the most important thing 
Now, this point light which is circulating into your wall will turn into the design light
which is IES light with the help of this 
Ok so, we will cut this for a time and what we will do, will just have the light, so here
you have the IES light profile 
So, I have downloaded the IES light from net and when you click here, it will just show
there, the light profile attributes 
Here you have to file name 
Ok just click over here and here I have the IES light pack which I have kept in my desktop 
So, these are the IES lights and these are its photos 
going to the any hotels, usually you can say, some of the spotlight is created on to the photographs 
So, I will select any of the IES lights, like any of them 
So, I will select <?>select drive</?> and open it and after that close it 
So, it’s not update in your view port as you can see 
But if I increase the intensity little bit because IES lights need more intensity 
Ok 
If I show you what you will get, let’s see 
As you can see, your lights really changes 
Now, you have the triangulate look 
Ok so, and if you change, I want to change the colour, definitely you can 
By simply going over here, just change the colour 
That makes some different kind of shapes, so if you require to generate such kind of
Ok like this you can work quite well 
Here you have maximum intensity, so if you want to just rotate it, you can definitely
rotate your light like this 
So, you go down, what happens, see 
the ground 
So, like this way you can work quite well 
So, we will discuss IES light in the exterior also 
And, let’s meet to the next session 
So, what happens now, what I will do, I will go to render settings and here will just off
shape in any three D application, we can use the IES profile lights over there 
this and I will tell you the panels, how it’s working and after that we will just have to
light in the particular exterior scene 
So, we have two buildings this and this one 
And for that, what I will do, will go to rendering and I will just select the point light 
So, the point light has formed and we have to align it at first and then we will go to
the render settings and here we have mental ray and here we have to check both of them 
As we discussed earlier and in common tab we will just off this, make sure that it’s
off 
So, now let’s switch to the Maya application and have look how you can go up with IES profile
So, if you see here what happens if global illumination and final gather would be on?
Both of them will just provide a softness into the light at its corners 
The light will soft at its corners so it will form some gradient look 
And in common, we have this enabled default light 
If we enable this, the surrounding light will be on and it will not be in proper visible 
So, we have to focus in the IES light only 
So, I will just off this plus we don’t need background light and will off this 
Now, by selecting the light, you have the mental ray tab because we have switched the
render settings from Maya software to mental ray 
in Maya software 
So, you will get this mental ray tab if you will select the light here we have the mental
ray tab 
So, if you click over here and if you go down, at first, before applying light profile, make
don’t require depth map, we don’t putting any map over here 
We just require the proper ray trace shadow 
Ok so, we will just have the ray trace shadow and we don’t require the caustics and all
because we don’t have reflective surface here 
It will ask you to upload the file name and the type of file 
Hi everyone 
﻿Hi everyone and welcome to this course  So, today  I will discuss IES light in this exterior   
and control G, we have a group and we have  the sunlight, which is here, we just grab this  
Let's have a look   
As you can see cut as you can see the result is  bouncing quite well if you focus in this part,  
you can have a good view  And if you want to  change the direction you can just have a look now   
So, have a look   
As you can see, we have just focused only in  one part and the bounciness the detail and the  
look squad Fine  As you can see here  also, it's quite looking amazing and also,  
we have the dull sun   So, if you have a look at your model,  
you can have a good result by having the lights  all over across your model to just work to set  
just check this again, is it disabled or not  Ok  fine now, we will go to indirect lighting and in  
the lights like one by one, one by one  So, that  would look much more effective if you can just put  
the lights in the window and nearby the window or  the gate  So, it will produce a good result    
So, hope you understand the concept of IES  lights  And ok so, we will move further  So,  
you will have a practice and you can practice in  this model that and you can practice in this type  
of model if you want to practice  And also, you  just have to put the light and just play with the  
intensity  If you copy a particular light, you  have to just go to its property panel and just  
increase the intensity plus you have to just go  to its light profile and just put the IES light   
So, that would help and also you can  download the IES light for free from net  
and have work for the same cut  and can work for the same   
So, hope you enjoyed the session   And let’s meet to the next session 
indirect lighting you just have both of them  checked- Global Illumination and Final Gather   
So, we will cut this and now we will  press seven  For seven, we should have  
this view for the lighting and after that,  we will focus in this part only at first   
So, we will go to attribute editor and in  attribute editor at first let’s check the shadow   
The shadow should be ray trace shadow  Ok so,  we will go to the Shadow, Shadow parameters and  
we will go to the ray trace shadow  Ok we will not  increase the intensity right now  We will increase  
these later wards  So, now as the shadow is on  which is ray-traced shadow  Now, what we will do,  
we will just go to the, here Light Profile   So, in Light Profile, we have this  
checker box and after that it will ask you to just  upload the IES light  The format is IES  Ok fine  
So, let's continue  So, as you know that I will go  to Render settings and in Render settings in  
we will click over here and we will go  to the desktop and here we have the IES   
So, we have this light open  And now what happens  if I just go to the render settings again,  
because we are doing the testing  So, we will  go to common and in common we have the HD so  
As you can see, we have just putted a simple  light in the background, which is obviously  
Yeah, it has, but the intensity is quite low   So, we will change the intensity and afterward,  
we will just have a Test Render again  So, what  I will do, I will select the light and just  
Common tab here you have the render options  So,  I just enable disabled this by unchecking it  If  
And if you increase the intensity more, directly  it will affect your light  So, we will change  
the intensity again  So, as you can see, it’s  forming  Now, we will increase the intensity  
to twenty-five, I think that will be fine  And if  you see your render view, it is a very different  
render, yeah, the render output would be  very different as compared to this one    
As you can see all the things is getting  burned, but it doesn't happen in your render   
So, as you can see the background you can use  the physical sun and sky, so we have used the  
physical sun and sky and also we can have the  lighting like this, because we just have to  
focus in the particular parts so that you may  have the idea about the IES lights and all 
if you want to change the colour, definitely  you can  You have the freedom to change the  
you check it will enable, so I have just disabled  it and I will just click this off  And what I will  
colour or you have the freedom to increase  the intensity also  So, if you just I will  
increase intensity by thirty five and what I  will do let's see thirty five  Ok fine and we  
will duplicate this particular light to here   But as we have discussed that if you duplicate any  
light, the light profile will never been copied  so we will copy it again and we will put some  
other other IES light  So, we will just select  this one, and if I just select this light only  
So, as you can see these parts inside it you can  put everywhere if you need  Then you can just  
have a normal lighting and just put it on the  IES light  Because, without having normal light  
you can put IES light, it will look not good  because a little bit of environment light will  
also be there  Then it will just produce a good  result  As you can see, both of them lights are  
do, I will just go to the point light and we will  select the point light  We will move out here ok  
different  So, the shape is also different  So,  you can just put the shape according to your need,  
as I have put it over like this shape   As you can see, it’s bouncing quite well because  
it has the depth and it has the detail, now it's  bouncing quite well  As you can see this area,  
especially this position, this part, it's  bouncing the light in a good way  And by this  
you can have the changing into the settings and  after that you can quit your light quite well  
and just put the light over here so that  it may bounce very well  And ok     
So, the position of the light is also  very important  So, I will press five  
Select this part, we will put it somehow over  here  As, we have discussed that the light profile  
will not copied, so we will just copy  the same  So, in this time I just use the  
three loop umbrella and will change intensity  at first let's see  Is it thirty-five?  
control V,  
light profile,  
umbrella and have a look   
As you can see, it’s not  affecting your environment  
and it's only affecting the model because  the light the property of light has changed   
So, as you can see it's bouncing quite well  at the top  If you just increase the gap  
between the gap yeah if you  cut if you increase the gap  
between the light and the object, and it will  bounce quite well  But if you increase very much,  
So, now as it moves, what we will do now  before going to the attribute editor,  
the light will just fade off  So, we will  increase accordingly  So, that would be fine  And  
we will check it  So, you can put all  the lights in the pillar like this  
that will look quite well  
So, what I will do I will just select  this  And especially the three on,  
and we will move little bit further   
Control D   
we will go to the Render setting again and here in  the Common tab we have enabled this default light   
So, the spacing between the light and the  object is very important  If your light is  
nearby the object then it will just produce  a small structure, but if your light have  
some amount of gap then it can be  split  But if you just move your light  
So, let’s have a look   
As you can see it is working quite  well  Here you have the lights and this  
is basically the plane the box, which  we have created for the <?>crown</?>   
So, if you want to delete the background light  and just change and have little bit of dullness,  
you can do it well  And you have the  lights, which is bouncing quite well    
So, make sure that you're saving  a new version and save it   
Going to the Attribute editor, we will go to the  Render settings and after that what we will do,  
So, if you want to change the colour  of the background you can do it,  
well  And make sure that whenever you are lighting  anything inside Maya, you may have at least  
to just make sure that you just have to check  out your intensity level, that would be very  
important  If you check your intensity  level, that would be very fine  Ok    
So, that's very important to check your intensity  level, and if you want to delete the background  
light, you can do it well  Go to the rendered  settings and all you have to just delete the  
like area light, spotlight or even  for the directional light and all    
So, we will just delete this  And we will create  it again and if you off this it will go to the  
display tab sorry window in outliner we have to  the sun direct  So, if you select all the lights,  
we will go to the render using Mental Ray  Ok   So, now if you go to Mental Ray, and  
﻿Hello everyone, welcome to the module number  fourteen  Here we will learn about the getting  
We will just increase the size little bit  So, I  will go to Attribute Editor by selecting it and  
we will go to area light shape  Ok fine    And here you have the Area Light  
panel  So, you can change the light type from  here we will not change the light type, increase  
the intensity, you can increase from here and  you have all the features like in this section  
and so you have Mental Ray  So, you can go to use  light shape, if I go here and just make a render   
That's why it's casting so  amount of light, we have to just  
decrease the level of intensity  By default, it  is one point zero, but we have to just decrease  
the level of intensity  We  
will decrease the intensity a little bit  And,  as you can see, our background is bluish kind of  
thing  So, we will change it to I think, which is  contour colour, as compared to the blue  And also,  
we will learn about the process of image-based  lighting inside Maya application  So, before going  
one more thing is that I will just go to Channel  Box and I will just on this thing  We will  
change the texture also from going to Assign New  Material and here you have the Mental Ray    
So, you have the material also, so you can use  the mental ray materials  But right now, I'm using  
simple Blinn and after using Blinn what I will do,  I will go to Blinn and just use the colour like  
this  And if you are not finding your  colour here, what you have to do,  
we will go to polygon and here you have  the normals you have the reverse    
So, you can reverse your normal  Now, you can see  it happened some time  As you can see, here also  
we have the same problem  So, we will select this  go to normals and you have the reverse, so you can  
And just do some much more tweaking in this thing   So, we will start working into <?>tweatik</?>  As  
to image-based lighting, what you have to do,  just go to Render settings and here you have the  
you can see, this part is getting shadowed, which  is good because we just use only one light  Now,  
we will use two or more lights  And  we will just look at the render  And  
after that, we will increase the amount of  final gather and global illumination    
So, as we have applied the Blinn, it's reflecting  quite well  So, we will not blow this thing  
because it's morning and we don't  require to blow all the things   
So, what we will do, we will just click this  off the thing and we will make some more lights  
for little bit of bounciness   And what I will do,  
just go to the Omni which is Point Light, click  the Point Light and we have just found the point  
light here and we will just move it around here   We will make sure that you're saving your file,  
because saving is very important  And in this  <?>control Z will be here</?> and we will  
Render Settings panel  In render settings, here  you have the option render using Maya software   
press seven for examine the light view   As you can see, if you press seven,  
you can go to the light view and I  will change the colour to little bit of  
bluish and we will change the intensity  also, because we don't require this amount  
of intensity  And here you have the Shadow  panel  So, in Shadow, you have the shadow like  
use ray trace shadow say it’s on, ok fine more  things like ray depth shadow limits  It will  
Light radius  Even you can also work with depth map shadow,  
but we don't have any maps  So, just put this  off  Now, have a look  Before rendering the same,  
what I will do, I will go to render settings  and in Common if you go here, you just find the  
size, so I will just decrease this level of  the size three twenty into two forty  Because  
So, you just go to Mental Ray, and after going to  Mental Ray just have all the features, which is  
we have to examine it, after that when we do the  final render, we will just increase the size by  
going through ten eighty P which is full HD or  even you can go to four k  That will take around  
huge amount of time  So, we will just  off this and we will do a Test Render   
As you can see, the intensity is quite high   So, we don't require this amount of intensity   
Plus, we also have to just work in this particular  section of light  So, we will select the light  
and we will decrease the intensity  a little bit  I think we will just  
judge that it is looking good or not  If you  are rendering the same, you can have the idea   
specially for mental ray   Now, we will change to Maya software   
If you don't find your mental ray, then what you  have to do, just go to Window and here you have  
the setting and preferences and here you have the  Plugin Manager  So, Plugin Manager, what does it  
means? It means that all the plugins which are  hidden in Maya, you can just on it or off it,  
according to your needs  So, as you can see, the  tick mark is basically which is on inside Maya,  
and the unchecked that means it is off in Maya   Auto load means whenever you open the Maya,  
familiar with the IBL, that's the image-based  lighting  So, whatever the scene available  
it will load that particular plugin   So, if you are not finding the Mental Ray  
on the Render Settings, what do you have to  do? Here you have the Maya to MR dot bundle,  
that means, you have to check both of them   If this doesn't check, then it will not load  
the same, if this doesn't check then it  will not show on your render settings    
So, Maya to MR dot bundle is very important to  check that particular thing if you want to work in  
mental ray  So, after switching to mental ray, you  have all the features and one more thing is that,  
so, we are using this simple interior and  you can find this interior model in Arnold  
sessions  So, we will just use this  interior in Arnold session also    
So, at first what we have to do, we have just  created a camera  So, I will go to panel and  
here you have the perspective  And here you have  the render underscore camera  So, we have created  
into the CC environment accordingly as per the  environment, there should be some bounciness  
the camera, and we have just set our render  view  Now, we don't require this Film Grid    
So, if you click over here, you have the Film  Grid, just click and now it's fine because  
in compositing software, you can add the Film  Grid  And here one more thing is that grid off,  
because grid is getting distracted  So, if you  press spacebar and right mouse button by holding  
right mouse button, you can go to perspective  Now, you have the freedom to rotate, and you can  
check your render settings and render lights and  all here  So, I will just take some more space  
because two is fine  We will do the adjustment  and we will just check from here  We will just  
print it from here  So, before proceeding for  the same one more thing is that make sure that  
just select complete model including your camera  and just make a new layer and just right click  
and add to selected  You can rename this  layer, so I can rename it INT interior,  
available onto that model, which help us to look  like that object would be available into the  
ok save, just go to zero zero  one, naming is very important    
So, now you can hide your reference like this   If you want to hide your reference, but yeah,  
we have to do it  So, I will just put R  What R  means that, means it is just reference the scene,  
that means, you can select anything inside  because it is converted into reference  Now,  
what happens? See I will go to render  settings and here you have the indirect  
lighting system  So, indirect lighting  here you have both option, which is  
image based lighting and physical sun and sky  So, we will look both of them  So, here you  
have the image-based lighting  So, image- based  lighting, just click over here and just created  
a dome  As you can see here, it’s just created  the dome, which is outside world  So, now you  
have the image  So, I will call up a image and you  should have at least HDRI images for that  Ok    
real-world environment  For that, we should  learn about the image-based lighting    
So, as you can see, we have a couples of HDRI  images, and we will select any of them  If you  
just click over here, we have this image and if  you just click over here, we have this image,  
so you can download or even you can click with  your camera  So, we have these images and what  
we will do? I will go to Maya and we will  choose the image  And here, we in desktop   
Here we have the HDRI images  And here if you  choose any of them, let's see what happens   
If I select this open, now as you can see,  
it just overlaps into your dome   So, you can change the HDRI,  
by simply rotating it  You can change the HDRI by  simply rotating it  As you can see, it's changing   
So, you can change it and now if you look  at your room, what happens? Let's see   
Here, the lighting and the dome is  appearing  So, if I press seven,  
And here in this module we will also learn about  the physical sun and sky, how we can create a  
much  And also, we have this roof which is  black  So, we have to just shut out it and  
one more thing is that we will just  go to six  Just press the six and just  
go through here  Here you find that this  part is getting darker  So, what we will do,  
we will just go to Channel Box  and we will on the reference    
Now, by selecting the HDRI  image and one more thing is that  
I will just go to the Render Settings  and in indirect lighting, here you have  
the common parameters  Where it is? So, as you  can go over here, we have the Common parameters,  
which is just beside it and in common  parameters you have the render options    
So, here you have the render options  In render  options, you have to just uncheck enable default  
realistic physical sun lighting in three D  application in Maya application here   
light  So, what happens let's have a look  As you  can see, the default light which is present in  
Maya is off  Now, the image which is outside is  casting some sort of light from here  You can  
just increase or decrease the level of exposure,  but I will just put for the time zero and now what  
happens next, I just minimize it   Now, you have to select the dome   
And if by selecting the dome,  you can go to Attribute Editor  
and here you have the detail of all the things   So, you have all the things like Advance,  
you have Legacy and you can go to Mental Ray  and you can have the Transform and all  Ok     
So, by selecting this light, and one more thing,  we go to render setting again and in indirect  
lighting panel, we have to check the Final Gather,  which is here, we will check the Final Gather   
And I think we should increase the  global illumination by checking it,  
Now, let’s switch to the Maya and have look how we  can create a photorealistic physical sun-based  
final gather map we don't require  final gather  Ok now, have a look   
So, as you can see your sample is not good at  this time, and it needs some amount of light also  
for illuminating the same  So, by having only one  light, you can't even do all the scene lighting  
because you need some more additional lights for  the same  So, for that what we have to do?   
We will just go to here and we will just select  the box and will not select the dome, will select  
only the box and we will go to Channel box and  we will just turn the reference <?>on</?>  So,  
we will press F for Fit to Screen  Now,  you can select, I will press four  Now,  
you have a better look and we will change and  we will apply few of the lights here also    
So, here you have the Rendering tab and I will  also open the Rendering tab here and you have  
the lighting features  So, it depends on you   If you select any of the panel it will show its  
lighting and image-based lighting  scene setup in Maya application   
property feature at the top  So, in Rendering  panel, you have the area light which is here   
If I click here, now our area  light has formed we can see    
So, we have to increase the size of the area  light as we will just go over here and we will  
focus on the same if you rotate this  See your  x value is changing, so we need minus one eighty  
and after that  
here, and we will increase the size  We will  go to five pressing and we will see    
So, what we will do, we will just pass  through the, I think the part would be fine   
Yeah, we will pass through the window and  just have little bit of modifications   
So, at first, I will save my file   So, we will go to File and Save As   
What we will do, we will just  select the light and move forward   
Hello, everyone, and welcome to this course of  Maya image-based lighting  So, in this session,
